                <head>About the Series</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of
                    the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of
                    the General Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of
                    State Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific
                    standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26,
                    1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, established a new
                    statutory charter for the preparation of the series, which was signed by
                    President <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">George H.W. Bush</persName> on October
                    28, 1991. Section 198 of <gloss target="#t_PL_1">P.L.</gloss> 102–138 added a
                    new Title IV to the Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22
                    U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than
                    30 years after the events recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume
                    meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and
                    editing.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for the <hi rend="roman">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    Series</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires
                    that government <pb n="IV" facs="0005" xml:id="pg_IV"/>agencies, departments,
                    and other entities of the U.S. Government engaged in foreign policy formulation,
                    execution, or support cooperate with the Department of State historians by
                    providing full and complete access to records pertinent to foreign policy
                    decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected records. Most of the
                    sources consulted in the preparation of this volume have been declassified and
                    are available for review at the National Archives and Records Administration
                    (Archives II), in College Park, Maryland.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and the memoranda of conversation
                    between the President and the Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the
                    files of overseas diplomatic posts. All of the Department’s central files for
                    1977–1981 are available in electronic or microfilm formats at Archives II, and
                    may be accessed using the Access to Archival Databases (AAD) tool. Almost all of
                    the Department’s decentralized office files covering this period, which the
                    National Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred to
                    or are in the process of being transferred from the Department’s custody to
                    Archives II.</p>
                <p>Research for <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes is undertaken
                    through special access to restricted documents at the <persName
                        corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Jimmy Carter</persName> Presidential Library and other
                    agencies. While all the material printed in this volume has been declassified,
                    some of it is extracted from still-classified documents. The staff of the Carter
                    Library is processing and declassifying many of the documents used in this
                    volume, but they may not be available in their entirety at the time of
                    publication. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the Carter Library
                    include some of the most significant foreign affairs related documentation from
                    White House offices, the Department of State, and other federal agencies
                    including the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the
                    Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>Some of the research for volumes in this subseries was done in Carter Library
                    record collections scanned for the Remote Archive Capture (RAC) project. This
                    project, which is administered by the National Archives and Records
                    Administration’s Office of Presidential Libraries, was designed to coordinate
                    the declassification of still-classified records held in various Presidential
                    libraries. As a result of the way in which records were scanned for the RAC, the
                    editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series were not always
                    able to determine whether attachments to <pb n="V" facs="0006" xml:id="pg_V"/>a
                    given document were in fact attached to the paper copy of the document in the
                    Carter Library file. In such cases, some editors of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series have indicated this ambiguity by stating that
                    the attachments were “Not found attached.”</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and date of the
                    conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the Chief of the Editing and Publishing
                    Division. The documents are reproduced as exactly as possible, including
                    marginalia or other notations, which are described in the footnotes. Texts are
                    transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions for the publication of
                    historical documents within the limitations of modern typography. A heading has
                    been supplied by the editors for each document included in this volume.
                    Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in the original
                    text, except that obvious typographical errors are silently corrected. Other
                    mistakes and omissions in documents are corrected by bracketed insertions: a
                    correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman type. Words repeated in
                    telegrams to avoid garbling or provide emphasis are silently corrected. Words
                    and phrases underlined in the source text are printed in italics. Abbreviations
                    and contractions are preserved as found in the original text, and a list of
                    abbreviations is included in the front matter of each volume. In telegrams, the
                    telegram number (including special designators such as Secto) is printed at the
                    start of the text of the telegram.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for
                    declassification purposes have been accounted for and are listed with headings,
                    source notes, and number of pages not declassified in their chronological place.
                    All brackets that appear in the original text are so identified in footnotes.
                    All ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the source of the document,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <pb n="VI" facs="0007" xml:id="pg_VI"/>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p>The numbers in the index refer to document numbers rather than to page
                    numbers.</p>

                    Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the Foreign Relations statute, reviews records, advises, and makes
                    recommendations concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series.
                    The Advisory Committee monitors the overall compilation and editorial process of
                    the series and advises on all aspects of the preparation and declassification of
                    the series. The Advisory Committee does not necessarily review the contents of
                    individual volumes in the series, but it makes recommendations on issues that
                    come to its attention and reviews volumes as it deems necessary to fulfill its
                    advisory and statutory obligations.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 13526 on Classified National Security
                    Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The
                    declassification review of this volume, which began in 2012 and was completed in
                    2013, resulted in the decision to withhold 0 documents in full, excise a
                    paragraph or more in 0 documents, and make minor excisions of less than a
                    paragraph in 1 document.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the documentation and edito<pb n="VII" facs="0008"
                        xml:id="pg_VII"/>rial notes presented here provide an undiluted record of

                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in the
                    foreign policy of the administration of <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">James E.
                        Carter</persName>. The subseries will present a documentary record of major
                    foreign policy decisions and actions of President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                        >Carter</persName>’s administration. This volume documents the intellectual
                    assumptions and themes underlying the foreign policy decisions made by the
                    administration.</p>

                    1977–1980, Volume I</p>
                <p>Much of the documentation included in this volume was drawn from public sources.
                    Speeches and policy statements were garnered from a number of published sources,
                    the most important of which were the <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the
                        Presidents of the United States</hi> and the Department of State <hi
                        rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>. A very useful source of information on the
                    intellectual assumptions underlying foreign policy proved to be the briefings
                    that President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs <persName
                        corresp="#p_BZK_1">Zbiginew Brzezinski</persName> periodically provided to
                    the press. The background briefings can be found in the Carter Library, National
                    Security Affairs, Brzezinski Material, <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1"
                        >Schecter</persName>/Friendly (Press) File, Subject File, Box 1.</p>
                <p>Among the classified sources consulted, the most useful were found in the
                    Presidential papers and other White House records maintained by the Carter
                    Library. A number of collections from the National Security Affairs (NSA) files
                    are relevant to research in this area. Within the NSA file, the Brzezinski
                    Material and Staff Material collections yield important documentation. Within
                    the Brzezinski Material, the Subject File, <persName corresp="#p_SJ_1"
                        >Schecter</persName>/Friendly (Press) File, and Brzezinski Office File are
                    especially useful; the Subject Chron File within the Brzezinski Office File
                    contains copies of <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s Weekly
                    National Security reports to the President.</p>
                <p>Of the lot files of the Department of State, the most useful for the purposes of
                    this compilation were the Policy Planning Staff (<gloss target="#t_SP_1"
                        >S/P</gloss>) Director’s Files. <persName corresp="#p_LWAK_1">Anthony
                        Lake</persName>’s records, which are available at the National Archives and
                    Records Administration (NARA), contain copies of <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                        >Vance</persName>’s and <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName>’s
                    speeches, Policy Planning Staff-authored studies on a variety of topics,
                    background materials related to the Department’s development of goals and
                    objectives statements, and documentation on issues such as human rights and
                    foreign assistance policy. The files of Secretary of State <persName
                        corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cyrus R. Vance</persName> include important documen<pb
                        n="X" facs="0011" xml:id="pg_X"/>tation on the 1976 transition period.
                    Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher’s files, also available at NARA,
                    yield important documentation on human rights, North–South issues, foreign
                    assistance policy, and the Department’s goals and objectives statements. The
                    Department of State’s Central Foreign Policy File, consisting of D, P, and N
                    reels, replaced the pre-1973 paper subject-numeric file. The P (Paper) reels
                    consist of microfilmed versions of memoranda of conversation, letters, briefing
                    papers, airgrams, and memoranda to principals.</p>
                <p>The <persName corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName> Papers housed at the
                    Minnesota Historical Society include <persName corresp="#p_MWF_1">Walter F.
                        Mondale</persName>’s Senatorial and Vice Presidential Papers. The most
                    useful collection in the Senatorial Papers is the Press Relations/Media
                    Activities Records. Within the Vice Presidential Papers, essential documentation
                    is located within the Foreign Policy Material From the <persName
                        corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Jimmy Carter</persName> Presidential Library files.</p>

                <p>The purpose of this volume is to document the intellectual foundations of the
                    foreign policy of the <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>
                    administration. This volume explores the collective mindset of <persName
                        corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> administration officials on foreign
                    policy issues rather than documenting significant foreign policy decisions or
                    diplomatic exchanges. The compilation takes as its canvas the entire record of
                    the <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> administration. Therefore,
                    the documents selected are necessarily a sampling chosen to illustrate policy
                    perspectives and themes rather than a thorough record of a bilateral
                    relationship or of a major issue. Similar to <ref target="frus1969-76v01">

                    published record of speeches, press releases, press conferences and briefings,
                    interviews, and testimony before Congressional committees to document policy
                    positions and the assumptions of administration officials on the foreign policy
                    process. The documentation in this volume chronicles the perspectives of not

                    <p>Georgia Governor <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Jimmy Carter</persName>
                        declared his candidacy for the Democratic Presidential nomination on
                        December 12, 1974. In preparation for <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName>’s announcement speech, adviser <persName
                            corresp="#p_ESE_1">Stuart Eizenstat</persName> and members of the
                        Governor’s Issues Group provided <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> with specific themes he needed to emphasize. In a
                        November 1, 1974, memorandum, <persName corresp="#p_ESE_1"
                            >Eizenstat</persName> surveyed the current mood in a post-Watergate
                        America:</p>
                    <p>“We are currently a country adrift from our moorings. Our leaders muddle
                        through from day to day, reacting to crises, with no notion of where we are
                        headed.</p>
                    <p>“As we approach our 200th anniversary as a nation, it is time that our
                        actions be guided by defined goals we wish to achieve in the balance of the
                        20th century. These are not pie-in-the-sky hopes but realistic, achievable
                        goals. These national goals must be clearly defined so that our citizens and
                        our decision-makers know where we are headed and why we are going
                        there.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ESE_1">Eizenstat</persName> stressed that while
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> did not need to define
                        “the specific goals the nation must set for itself,” he should “display some
                        notion of the areas in which <hi rend="italic">specific, defined goals are a
                            prerequisite to national government decision-making</hi>.” In addition
                        to five domestic areas, <persName corresp="#p_ESE_1">Eizenstat</persName>
                        listed the elimination of domestic and international hunger and “a foreign
                        policy which is realistic, reasonable, and which reflects our national goals
                        and ideals and stresses the tempered use of power abroad.” Referencing
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>’s ability to demonstrate
                        national leadership, <persName corresp="#p_ESE_1">Eizenstat</persName>
                        noted:</p>
                    <p>“You have had to make executive decisions—to make a budget and live within
                        it—to develop new programs and provide the leadership to carry through these
                        programs—to deal with people on a daily basis, not with Washington
                        lobbyists—while your principal opponents have never made executive decisions
                        but simply react as legislators to problems—who can propose the world
                        without regard to accountability or efficiency of their proposals. Your
                        experience is closer to that required as President than theirs. Indeed,
                        their ’duties’ are such they can run for President and be Senator at the
                        same time.</p>
                    <pb n="2" facs="0043" xml:id="pg_2"/>
                    <p>“You should stress your own varied background—e.g. farmer and nuclear
                        physicist—with <hi rend="italic">emphasis</hi> on your foreign policy
                        experience.</p>
                    <p>“Your accomplishments should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be set out in
                        washer-list form but should be interspersed throughout the speech.” (Carter

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> formally announced his
                        candidacy at events both in Washington and Atlanta, Georgia. In an address
                        he delivered at a luncheon held at the National Press Club, <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> briefly described his background,
                        stressing the commonalities and dreams he believed all Americans shared.
                        Such dreams, he rued, had been compromised by “debilitating compromise,
                        acceptance of mediocrity, subservience to special interests, and an absence
                        of executive vision and direction.” He called for the American people to
                        “reaffirm and to strengthen our ethical and spiritual and political
                        beliefs,” setting out specific steps that governmental officials should take
                        to regain public trust. With regard to foreign policy, <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> asserted:</p>
                    <p>“It is obvious that domestic and foreign affairs are directly interrelated. A
                        necessary base for effective implementation of any foreign policy is to get
                        our domestic house in order.</p>
                    <p>“Coordination of effort among the leaders of our nation should be established
                        so that our farm production, industrial development, foreign trade, defense,
                        energy, and diplomatic policies are mutually supportive and not in
                        conflict.</p>
                    <p>“The time for American intervention in all the problems of the world is over.
                        But we cannot retreat into isolationism. Ties of friendship and cooperation
                        with our friends and neighbors must be strengthened. Our common interests
                        must be understood and pursued. The integrity of Israel must be preserved.
                        Highly personalized and narrowly focused diplomatic efforts, although
                        sometimes successful, should be balanced with a more wide-ranging
                        implementation of foreign policy by competent foreign service officers.</p>
                    <p>“Our nation’s security is obviously of paramount importance, and everything
                        must be done to insure adequate military preparedness. But there is no

                        a rally of family, friends, and political supporters at the Atlanta Civic

                        asserted that winning the Presidency was not the “most important thing in my
                        life.” Continuing, he noted: “There are many other things <pb n="3"

                        not tell a lie; I would not mislead the American people; I would not avoid
                        taking a stand on a controversial issue which is important to our country or
                        the world. And I would not betray your trust.” Referencing his earlier

                        covering “30 specific issues in some superficial way.” Once he left
                        gubernatorial office on January 14, 1975, he intended to “spell these issues
                        much more clearly and much more definitively and much more thoroughly. So
                        that by the time the end of this campaign arrives, the American people will
                        know not only what I stand for, but, I hope with my efforts and those of
                        other candidates, what this country ought to stand for.” (<hi rend="italic"

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign policy was the subject of an address delivered to
                            the American Chamber of Commerce in Tokyo, Japan, May 28, 1975. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> said:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The world in 1975 is a very different world from that which we knew in the
                        1950’s and 1960’s. Recent events have proven that a stable world order for
                        the future cannot be built on a preoccupation with the old strategic issues
                        which have dominated East-West and North-South relations since the end of
                        World War II.</p>
                    <pb n="4" facs="0045" xml:id="pg_4"/>
                    <p>Recently, with the end of the Vietnam conflict, a tremendous burden has been
                        lifted from our shoulders—both an economic burden and one of divisiveness
                        and doubt. Our over-involvement in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian
                        countries is resulting in a mandatory reassessment by the American people of
                        our basic foreign policies. The lessons we have learned can be a basis for
                        dramatic improvements in the prospects for world peace and the solutions for
                        international problems. The people of the United States are inclined to look
                        toward the future and not to dwell on the mistakes of the past.</p>
                    <p rend="center">
                        <hi rend="italic">Lessons Learned</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>What are the lessons we have learned? What are our likely decisions about the
                        future?</p>
                    <p>There is no doubt that our people are wary of any new foreign involvements,
                        but we realize that many such involvements will be necessary.</p>
                    <p>We have learned that never again should our country become militarily
                        involved in the internal affairs of another nation unless there is a direct
                        and obvious threat to the security of the United States or its people. We
                        must not use the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> or other covert means
                        to effect violent change in any government or government policy. Such
                        involvements are not in the best interests of world peace, and they are
                        almost inherently doomed to failure.</p>
                    <p>When we embrace one of the contending leadership factions in a country, too
                        often it is the power of the United States, not the support of the people,
                        which keeps that leader in power. Our chosen leader may then resort to
                        repressive force against his own people to keep himself in power.</p>
                    <p>We have learned the hard way how important it is during times of
                        international stress and turmoil to keep close ties with our allies and
                        friends and to strive for multilateral agreements and solutions to critical
                        problems. I hope that our days of unilateral intervention such as occurred
                        in Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Dominican Republic are over.</p>
                    <p>Another lesson to be learned is that we cannot impose democracy on another
                        country by force. Also, we cannot buy friends; and it is obvious that other
                        nations resent it if we try. Our interests lie in protecting our national
                        security, in preventing war, in peacefully promoting the principles of human
                        freedom and democracy, and in exemplifying in our foreign policy the true
                        character and attitudes of the American people.</p>
                    <p>We understand the vital importance of our relationship with our allies. Our
                        friends in Japan, Western Europe and Israel must know that we will keep our
                        promises; yet, they will be reassured not by promises but by tangible
                        actions and regular consultations. It is particularly im<pb n="5"
                            facs="0046" xml:id="pg_5"/>portant that we recement strained
                        relationships with our allies; that will be far easier to accomplish now
                        that our involvement in Vietnam is over. The United States will always honor
                        those commitments which have been made openly by our leaders and with the
                        full knowledge and involvement of the people of our country.</p>
                    <p>We must never again keep secret the evolution of our foreign policy from the
                        Congress and the American people. They should never again be misled about
                        our options, our commitments, our progress, or our failures. If the
                        President sets the policy openly, reaching agreement among the officers of
                        the government, if the President involves the Congress and the leaders of
                        both parties rather than letting a handful of people plot the policy behind
                        closed doors, then we will avoid costly mistakes and have the support of our
                        citizens in our dealings with other nations. Our commitments will be
                        stronger; abrupt changes will be fewer.</p>
                    <p>Secretaries of State and Defense and other Cabinet officers should regularly
                        appear before Congress, hopefully in televised sessions, to answer hard
                        questions and to give straight answers. No equivocation nor unwarranted
                        secrecy should be permitted.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>What are the other elements of our future foreign policy? This is no time for
                        thoughts of isolationism. We can now turn our attention more effectively
                        toward matters like the world economy, freedom of the seas, environmental
                        quality, food, population, peace, conservation of irreplaceable commodities,
                        and the reduction of world armaments. The intensity of our interrelated
                        problems is rapidly increasing, and better mechanisms for consultation must
                        be established and utilized before these problems become more dangerous.</p>
                    <p>Interdependence among nations is an unavoidable and increasing factor in our
                        individual lives. We know that even a nation with an economy as strong as
                        ours is affected by errors such as the excessive sale of wheat to Russia in

                        Western Europe, and Japan.</p>
                    <p>The machinery of consultation must be reexamined and some new mechanisms
                        developed. Others need to be abandoned or revitalized. We must strengthen
                        international organizations such as the World Bank, the International
                        Monetary Fund, and the United Nations. Our new commitment to multinational
                        consultation should be reflected in the quality of the representatives we
                        appoint to international agencies.</p>
                    <p>It is likely in the near future that issues of war and peace will be more a
                        function of economic and social problems than of the military security
                        problems which have dominated international relations in the world since
                        World War II.</p>
                    <p>The relationship between Japan and the United States is based on both firm
                        pillars of interest—our mutual security and our great economic
                        relationship.</p>
                    <p>The security of Japan is vital to the United States, and we will maintain our
                        commitment to Japan’s defense. The sensitive question of the level and
                        deployment of military forces here will, of course, be shaped in a

                        commerce the world has ever known. We rely on one another. There is no place
                        for abrupt unilateral decisions which shock the other trading partner. Major
                        foreign policy actions affecting the other must be thoroughly discussed in
                        advance with our friend.</p>
                    <p>Interdependence means mutual sacrifice. For example, we must cooperate with
                        our allies in reducing our demands for fossil fuel, assist them in the
                        alternative development of energy resources, build up common stockpiles,
                        plan jointly for future crises, and share the oil investments of the <gloss
                            target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> countries.</p>
                    <p>Among our people there is broad support for continuing the policy of détente
                        with the Soviet Union and China—but not at the expense of close cooperation
                        and consultation with our friends and allies. We must again reorient our
                        foreign policy attention toward our friends. Our recent emphases have all
                        too often involved our adversaries and ignored the interests and needs of
                        our allies. Détente should be pursued on a mutually beneficial basis through
                        a series of sustained, low key and open discussions among the
                        participants—and not just dramatic or secret agreements among two or three
                        national leaders.</p>
                    <p>Our concern with foreign policy, however, must go beyond avoiding the
                        mistakes of the past, reaffirming our close relationship with our allies,
                        and continuing the process of détente. We must end the continuing
                        proliferation of atomic weapons throughout the world, which is as senseless
                        as a waste of precious resources as it is a mortal <pb n="7" facs="0048"

                    <p>We must play a constructive role in the resolution of local conflicts which
                        may lead to major power confrontations. Peace in the Middle East is of vital
                        interest to us all. While peace is the basic responsibility of the nations
                        in the area, the United States must help secure this peace by maintaining
                        the trust of all sides. We must strive to maintain good relations with the
                        Arab countries as well as Israel, and to recognize Arab needs and
                        aspirations as long as they recognize that the major element of a settlement
                        is the guaranteed right of Israel to exist as a viable and peaceful nation.
                        The rights of the Palestinians must also be recognized as part of any final
                        solution.</p>
                    <p>It is essential that the flow of oil to Japan and Western Europe never be
                        shut off. The United States should not consider unilateral action in the
                        Middle East to assure our own nation’s access to Mideast oil. Open or veiled
                        threats of armed intervention do not contribute toward a peaceful settlement
                        of the problems of this tortured region.</p>
                    <p>The peoples of the developing nations need the aid, technology, and knowledge
                        of the developed nations. We need the developed na<pb n="8" facs="0049"
                            xml:id="pg_8"/>tions as sources for raw materials and as markets for our
                        exports. The world will not be a safe or decent place in which to live,
                        however, if it continues to divide between countries which are increasingly
                        rich and those which are increasingly impoverished.</p>
                    <p>The knowledge that food, oil, fertilizer and financial credit are vital must
                        not be the cause of international extortion; rather, our interdependence
                        should provide a basis on which continuing international trade agreements
                        can be reached. There is a danger that the recent economic successes of the
                        Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel will encourage other
                        confrontation by countries possessing scarce raw materials. This could be a
                        serious and self-damaging mistake, resulting in a series of pyramiding and
                        perhaps uncontrollable confrontations, leading to serious damage to the
                        poorer and weaker nations.</p>
                    <p>A stable world order cannot become a reality when people of many nations of
                        the world suffer mass starvation; when the countries with capital and
                        technology belligerently confront other nations for the control of raw
                        materials and energy sources; when open and discriminatory trade has become
                        the exception rather than the rule; when there are no established
                        arrangements for supplying the world’s food and energy nor for governing,
                        control, and development of the seas; and when there are no effective
                        efforts to deal with population explosions or environmental quality.</p>
                    <p>We must remember that because of our tremendous and continuing economic,
                        military and political strength, the United States has an inevitable role of
                        leadership to play within the community of nations. But our influence and
                        respect should go beyond our military might, our political power, and our
                        economic wealth—and be based on the fact that we are right, and fair, and
                        decent, and honest, and truthful.</p>
                    <p>Our U.S. foreign policy must once again reflect the basic ideals of our
                        people and our nation. We must reassert our vital interest in human rights
                        and humanitarian concerns, and we must provide enlightened leadership in the
                        world community. The people of the United States want to be trusted and
                        respected, and we are determined, therefore, to be trustworthy and
                        respectful of others.</p>

                        tragic experience in Vietnam which showed how empty is a foreign policy
                        based on military power alone.</p>
                    <p>As we try to define America’s future world role, we must take full account of
                        the fact that the citizens of this country are profoundly skeptical. They
                        know only too well that their patriotism has been exploited by political
                        leaders who could no longer justify their actions with candor. I do not
                        believe that the United States is about to become an isolationist country,
                        but the American people no longer want to be the world’s policemen nor go on
                        one-man crusades. I believe that Americans are willing to continue to
                        shoulder our fair share of the world’s responsibilities, but only if these
                        responsibilities are defined in terms that make sense, that are consistent
                        with our basic values and that relate to our real concerns. This requires
                        that we go back to basics—in the terms that we use to think about foreign
                        policy, in the values we pursue, and in the way we view the real sources of
                        America’s prestige and power.</p>
                    <p>The first step in revising our thinking about foreign policy should be to
                        jettison the amorphous term “national security,” and to get back <pb n="10"
                            facs="0051" xml:id="pg_10"/>to talking concretely about our diplomatic,

                    <p>The term “national security” has dominated our thinking in foreign affairs
                        for three decades. In the late 1940’s, when the National Security Council
                        was established by law,<note n="4" xml:id="d3fn4">Reference is to the
                            National Security Act of 1947, which President <persName
                                corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName> signed into law on July 26,
                            1947. The Act established the National Security Council, which met for
                            the first time on September 26. For additional information, see <ref

                        about a monolithic enemy—the Soviet Union, the Peoples Republic of China,
                        and Communist parties throughout the world appeared to be acting in concert,
                        using every means of diplomacy, military coercion, economic leverage and
                        propaganda, orchestrated on behalf of Soviet imperialistic expansion. With
                        the lessons of Hitler fresh in our minds, we felt, and I believe quite
                        rightly, that we had to meet this threat with a comprehensive national
                        effort. Otherwise we believed that the United States and the American people
                        would ultimately be placed in direct jeopardy.</p>
                    <p>But as the years passed, the Sino-Soviet alliance cracked apart. Communist
                        parties outside the Soviet Bloc began to define their interests to suit
                        themselves and not the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Our own problems became more complicated and the concept of “national
                        security” was not much of a guide to solving them. For example, the idea of
                        national security has militarized our foreign policy to the point of being
                        virtually helpless when confronted by major international economic problems
                        such as energy. All we could do to respond to <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1"
                            >OPEC</gloss>’s fourfold increase in the price of oil was to mutter
                        empty threats about invading the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>But even worse, I believe the fog of national security helped to lead us into
                        the tragic swamp of Vietnam, into the morass called Watergate.</p>
                    <p>In the early 1960’s we saw Vietnam as a threat to our overall national
                        security. We could not see that our interests in Southeast Asia were
                        diplomatic, not military. The problem was to contain the threat of Soviet
                        and Chinese Communist influence, and not as some suggested at the time, to
                        defend Hawaii.</p>
                    <p>While there was nothing wrong with encouraging a democratic, pro-U.S.
                        government in Saigon, we failed to recognize that our bottomline interest
                        only required a reasonably independent South Vietnam, regardless of the
                        complexion of its government. Skillful diplomacy, not military intervention,
                        might have achieved—and in fact might still achieve—that basic diplomatic
                        objective.</p>
                    <p>National security confused our objectives at home, as well as abroad. If we
                        wanted to support higher education, we had to justify it in terms of
                        national security. When we wanted to make sensible long-<pb n="11"
                            facs="0052" xml:id="pg_11"/>term investment in basic scientific
                        research, we found we could only do it in the name of national security.
                        When we faced the choice between a Great Society at home and defending our
                        so-called national security in Southeast Asia, you know what took priority.
                        The war on poverty was lost long before the war in Vietnam ground to its
                        tragic finale.</p>
                    <p>In time, this bloated concept of national security ultimately came home to us
                        with Watergate. Who can forget the passage in the White House tapes when
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Richard Nixon</persName> is groping for a
                        way to try to justify to the American public the break-in of Daniel
                        Ellsberg’s psychiatrist’s office?</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DJW_1">John Dean</persName> suggests, “You might put
                        it on a national security grounds basis.” The President responds, “National
                        security. We had to get information coming out and everything coming out.
                        The whole thing was national security.” <persName corresp="#p_DJW_1">John
                            Dean</persName> adds, “I think we could get by on that.”</p>
                    <p>And there was an even more chilling exchange in the Watergate hearings when
                        Senator <persName corresp="#p_THE_1">Talmadge</persName> asked <persName
                            corresp="#p_EJ_1">John Ehrlichman</persName>, “Now if the President
                        could authorize a covert break-in, and you do not know exactly how that
                        power would be limited, you do not think it could include murder or other
                        crimes beyond a covert break-in, do you?” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_EJ_1"
                            >Ehrlichman</persName> answers, “I do not know where the line is,
                        Senator.”</p>
                    <p>Let’s retire this term “national security” and get back to defining our
                        interests more concretely, in terms of diplomatic interests, military
                        interests, and economic interests; or political, humanitarian, ethnic and
                        cultural interests.</p>
                    <p>I see nothing wrong in being frank about the fact that in the Middle East our
                        support for Israel is based on political and cultural affinity, that our
                        desire for good relations with the Arab states is based on economic
                        interests, and that our hope for peace between the two is based on concern
                        that war could prompt a military confrontation between the United States and
                        the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Portugal offers another example of how dealing with specific interests rather
                        than the concept of national security helps clarify what is at stake. While
                        we would like to see a democratic Portugal, and should do what we can to
                        encourage that, our primary interest is military. We must not be too pious
                        in our criticism of the present government and forget that we were willing
                        to tolerate a truly odious dictator for generations—precisely because the
                        Salazar regime<note n="5" xml:id="d3fn5">Reference is to Antonio de Oliveira
                            Salazar, who served as the Portuguese Prime Minister from 1932 until
                            1968.</note> provided us with a military base in the Azores that enabled
                        us to control the Atlantic and support the Middle East.</p>
                    <pb n="12" facs="0053" xml:id="pg_12"/>
                    <p>By putting our interest in Portugal’s internal affairs into perspective, I
                        think it should make it even more possible for us to be patient, to be more
                        understanding of the very difficult internal problems of establishing a
                        reasonably representative and progressive government in the aftermath of
                        decades of tyranny. I believe we need not worry too much about how the
                        political complexion in Portugal may change from day to day. Personally, I
                        will be rooting for the moderate and democratic forces in Portugal, but as a
                        government we should be clear that the essential American concern is for the
                        continuation of our military relationship.</p>
                    <p>The second major issue we need to confront in defining our future foreign
                        policy is how to support our basic values without winding up back in places
                        like Vietnam. I do not believe the American people will support a foreign
                        policy devoid of human values, yet how do we stop short of meddling in other
                        peoples’ affairs?</p>
                    <p>I believe strongly that we can and should support human rights, individual
                        freedom and justice, governments who derive their power from the consent of
                        the governed. I have always opposed communism because it has jeopardized
                        these values. But somewhere along the line we lost sight of the fact that we
                        were contesting tyranny, regardless of its political coloration.</p>
                    <p>We became absorbed in the narrower struggle against communism, and in the
                        process supported and ultimately overcommitted ourselves to some of the most
                        outrageously oppressive regimes in the world. And ironically, the
                        consequence has often been to give a boost to the Communists by identifying
                        the United States and our values with petty tyrants.</p>
                    <p>The lesson, I believe, is to support those who truly favor democracy,
                        freedom, and social justice and treat with equal disdain tyrants, whatever
                        their political label.</p>
                    <p>A second major lesson that we should have learned by now is that our
                        commitment to freedom and justice cannot substitute for the lack of
                        commitment on the part of others. We cannot care more about the integrity
                        and independence of a country being threatened than its leaders. We must not
                        offer to make sacrifices that are greater than the sacrifices to be borne by
                        those we would help.</p>
                    <p>A third way to be true to our values, yet avoid the pitfalls of another
                        Vietnam, is to turn our attention to the great unfinished business on the
                        world’s agenda: hunger, development, economic stability and progress, a new
                        equitable regime for the oceans, a more effective control of conventional
                        and nuclear arms. There is a very long list that has received too low
                        priority for too great a time. By tackling these problems, I believe that we
                        can fulfill our responsibilities, pursue our basic values, without
                        inevitably being drawn into the agony of war. We <pb n="13" facs="0054"
                            xml:id="pg_13"/>may, in fact, even be able to make a contribution to
                        reducing some of the causes of human conflict.</p>
                    <p>Finally, if we are to define a new direction for American foreign policy, we
                        must have a more balanced appreciation of the real sources of American power
                        and influence in the world. With military power second to none, we were
                        unable to alter the course of history in Vietnam. With the ability to
                        destroy the world we could not prevent the oil-producing countries from
                        bringing truly agonizing hardship to millions upon millions of Americans in
                        the form of inflation and the deepest depression since the 1930’s. And all
                        the military might in the world does not enable us to command the respect we
                        once had in the international arena.</p>
                    <p>Military power is increasingly irrelevant to the host of economic, social and
                        political issues confronting this country. This is not to say that we do not
                        have a fundamental military interest in a stable strategic relationship with
                        the Soviet Union or with a secure Europe, Japan and Israel. But the oil
                        cartel, the threat of other commodity cartels, the problem of world hunger,
                        worldwide recession and inflation—none of these issues, which immediately
                        affect the security of every American, can be resolved by military
                        force.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, I am convinced that the basic source of American power to deal with
                        these issues lies in the ability of the American people and their government
                        to solve this nation’s problems. Our ability to manage a growing and vibrant
                        economy, to be first in the world in technological innovation; to lead the
                        world in efforts to bring equality to all of our citizens; to provide social
                        justice, good housing, jobs, schools; to take care of our old; to insure
                        equal opportunity to our young—these are the things that once were the
                        hallmark of America. We were respected for these things. Nations sought our
                        advice and our counsel, because they had confidence in our leadership, in
                        our sense of priorities, and in our humanity.</p>
                    <p>Now, after decades in which considerations of national security have taken
                        priority over all others in this country, we have squandered $150 billion
                        worth of investment in the quagmire of Vietnam. We have spent over $1
                        trillion in arms. We have sent our best and brightest into the defense
                        industries, into the military services, into the secret intelligence
                        agencies. We have kept our military machine polished, but have let our
                        cities decay, our transportation systems collapse, our national unity
                        dissolve. We have pursued American ideals in the jungles of Southeast Asia
                        and have ignored them in the jungles of our cities.</p>
                    <p>If there is anything that must underline a new foreign policy for the United
                        States, it should be the recognition that the source of America’s strength
                        and influence in the world is our ability to meet our <pb n="14" facs="0055"
                            xml:id="pg_14"/>needs at home. If we can’t solve our problems here, we
                        are not going to solve our problems, or anybody else’s problems, abroad.</p>
                    <p>This is not a call to isolationism, nor unilateral disarmament. We must keep
                        this country strong militarily, and we will no doubt devote the resources to
                        do so. The Soviet Union and others should not be tempted by recent events
                        into miscalculating our commitment to our friends and allies. We are not
                        opting out of the world.</p>
                    <p>In fact, I think that perhaps we have finally turned the last page on
                        isolationism in the United States. Isolationism is an unwillingness to deal
                        with the world as it is. At one time America demonstrated this by having
                        nothing to do with international affairs. And when we became involved in
                        world affairs, we seemed to want to control everything, to transform other
                        countries in our image, to leave nothing to chance. This too was an
                        unwillingness to deal with the world as it is, and really is a kind of
                        isolationism.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps now we will begin to accept the diversity, the conflict, and even the
                        disorder that are inherent in the world. We cannot completely control such
                        things, and we have found, to our tragic dismay, that if we try, they only
                        end up controlling us.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President. I have tried to outline my views on the basic principles
                        underlying the development of a new American foreign policy in this
                        post-Vietnam period.</p>
                    <p>—First, our policy must be one that is not dominated by elitist abstractions
                        like “national security,” but which is grounded in concrete interests which
                        the American people can identify with and support.</p>
                    <p>—Second, we must be more disciplined, but no less determined, in the pursuit
                        of our ideals. The response to our overinvolvement in Vietnam is not a
                        Philistine policy devoid of values. Rather, it is to rededicate ourselves
                        more conscientiously to democracy, freedom, justice and the international
                        agenda of human needs.</p>
                    <p>—Third, we must draw upon sources of national power and influence in addition
                        to military power in the pursuit of our foreign policy. We must recognize
                        that America is strong abroad only insofar as it is strong at home. World
                        leadership and respect will be determined by how well we meet the needs of
                        our own people—for only in that way can this nation recapture its unique
                        claim to being the last, best hope for mankind.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">In a presentation to the Chicago Council on Foreign
                            Relations, March 15, 1976, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                                >Carter</persName> said:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>I am pleased to speak to you today. This council is the oldest, the largest,
                        and the most active organization of its kind in the country. For over 50
                        years you have helped make this city and this region better informed about a
                        world which the St. Lawrence Seaway now brings to your doorstep. Men like
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_5">Adlai Stevenson</persName>, <persName
                            corresp="#p_DP_2">Paul Douglas</persName>, and <persName
                            corresp="#p_KWF_1">Frank Knox</persName> studied the world through this
                        council and went on to make history.</p>
                    <p>I want to take this opportunity to explain how I shall approach the problems
                        of foreign policy if I am elected President:</p>
                    <p>How I see our international situation today;</p>
                    <p>What our role in the world should be;</p>
                    <p>How we should approach our relationships with different kinds of
                        international neighbors;</p>
                    <p>What kinds of policies, and what kind of policymakers we shall need so that
                        our international relations can be true expressions of the goals and the
                        character of the people of our country.</p>
                    <p>Our recent foreign policy, I am afraid, has been predicated on a belief that
                        our national and international strength is inevitably deteriorating. I do
                        not accept this premise.</p>
                    <p>The prime responsibility of any President is to guarantee the security of our
                        nation, with a tough, muscular, well-organized, and effective fighting
                        force. We must have the ability to avoid the threat of successful attack or
                        blackmail, and we must always be strong enough to carry out our legitimate
                        foreign policy. This is a prerequisite to peace.</p>
                    <p>Our foreign policy today is in greater disarray than at any time in recent
                        history.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>.</note> simply does
                        not trust the judgment of the American people, but constantly conducts
                        foreign policy exclusively, personally, and in secret. This creates in our
                        country the very divisions which he has lately deplored. Longstanding
                        traditions of a bipartisan policy and close consultation between the
                        President and Congress have been seriously damaged.</p>
                    <p>We are losing a tremendous opportunity to reassert our leadership in working
                        with other nations in the cause of peace and progress. The good will our
                        country once enjoyed, based on what we stood for and the willingness of
                        others to follow our example, has been dissipated.</p>
                    <p>Negotiations with the Soviets on strategic arms are at dead center, while the
                        costly and dangerous buildup of nuclear weapons continues.</p>
                    <p rend="center">
                        <hi rend="italic">Public Confidence Eroded</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The policy of détente, which holds real possibilities for peace, has been
                        conducted in a way that has eroded the public confidence it must have.</p>
                    <p>The moral heart of our international appeal—as a country which stands for
                        self-determination and free choice—has been weakened. It is obviously
                        un-American to interfere in the free political processes of another nation.
                        It is also un-American to engage in assassinations in time of peace in any
                        country.</p>
                    <p>The people of other nations have learned, in recent years, that they can
                        sometimes neither trust what our government says nor predict what it will
                        do. They have been hurt and disappointed so many times that they no longer
                        know what to believe about the United States. They want to respect us. They
                        like our people. But our people do not seem to be running our
                        government.</p>
                    <p>Every time we have made a serious mistake in recent years in our dealings
                        with other nations, the American people have been excluded from the process
                        of evolving and consummating our foreign policy. Unnecessary secrecy
                        surrounds the inner workings of our own government, and we have sometimes
                        been deliberately misled by our leaders.</p>
                    <p>For many nations, we have two policies; one announced in public, another
                        pursued in secret. In the case of China, we even seem to have two
                            Presidents.<note n="3" xml:id="d4fn3">Presumable reference to <persName

                    </p>
                    <p>No longer do our leaders talk to the people of the world with the vision,
                        compassion, and practical idealism of men like <persName corresp="#p_WW_1"
                            >Woodrow Wilson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">John

                    <p>Our foreign policy is being evolved in secret, and in its full details and
                        nuances, it is probably known to one man only. That man is skilled at
                        negotiation with leaders of other countries but far less concerned with
                        consulting the American people or their representatives in Congress, and far
                        less skilled in marshaling the support of a nation behind an effective
                        foreign policy. Because we have let our foreign policy be made for us, we
                        have lost something crucial in the way we talk and the way we act toward
                        other peoples of the world.</p>
                    <p>When our President and Secretary of State speak to the world without the
                        understanding or support of the American people, they speak with an
                        obviously hollow voice.</p>
                    <p>All of this is a cause of sorrow and pain to Americans, as well as to those
                        who wish us well and look to us for leadership. We ought to be leading the
                        way toward economic progress and social justice and a stronger, more stable
                        international order. They are the principles on which this nation was
                        founded 200 years ago, by men who believed with Thomas Paine that the “cause
                        of America is the cause of all mankind.”</p>
                    <p>Every successful foreign policy we have had—whether it was the Good Neighbor

                        because it reflected the best that was in us.</p>
                    <p rend="center">
                        <hi rend="italic">Vietnam to Angola</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>And in every foreign venture that has failed—whether it was Vietnam,
                        Cambodia, Chile, Angola, or in the excesses of the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                            >CIA</gloss>—our government forged ahead without consulting the American
                        people, and did things that were contrary to our basic character.</p>
                    <p>The lesson we draw from recent history is that public understanding and
                        support are now as vital to a successful foreign policy as they are to any
                        domestic program. <hi rend="italic">No one can make our foreign policy for
                            us as well as we can make it ourselves.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The role of the United States in the world is changing. For years, we were
                        the only free nation with the military capacity to keep the peace and the
                        resources to insure world economic stability. Japan and Western Europe would
                        never have been able to achieve their economic miracles without our help.
                        Nor could world exports have risen to their present level of three-quarters
                        of a trillion dollars, had not international trade and investment been
                        backed for so long by the American dollars.</p>
                    <p>These were historic and generous accomplishments, of which we can be justly
                        proud. But we also had the power to make or break regimes with adroit
                        injections of money or arms, and we sometimes used this power in ways that
                        are less commendable.</p>
                    <pb n="18" facs="0059" xml:id="pg_18"/>
                    <p>The world is different now. The old postwar monopolies of economic resource
                        and industrial power have been swept aside and replaced by new structures.
                        The Common Market countries and others like Japan, Mexico, Brazil, and Iran
                        are strong and self-sufficient.</p>
                    <p>We have learned that we cannot and should not try to intervene militarily in
                        the internal affairs of other countries unless our own nation is
                        endangered.</p>
                    <p>Over 100 new nations have come into being in the past 30 years. A few have
                        wealth, but most exist in bitter poverty. In many, independence has set
                        loose long-suppressed emotions and antagonisms. In Uganda and Angola,
                        Bangladesh and Lebanon—and recently in the United Nations—we have seen what
                        can happen when nationalist and racial passions, or tribal or religious
                        hatreds, are left to run their course.</p>
                    <p>We cannot isolate ourselves from the forces loose in the world. The question
                        is not whether we take an interest in foreign affairs, but how we do it and
                        why we do it.</p>
                    <p>In the last few years, I have traveled in foreign lands, and met with many of
                        their leaders. I have served on international bodies, such as the Trilateral
                        Commission, which makes recommendations on some of these problems. I have
                        given thought to the structure of what our foreign policy should be.</p>
                    <p>There are certain basic principles I believe should guide whatever is done in
                        foreign lands in the name of the United States of America.</p>
                    <p>First, our policies should be as open and honest and decent and compassionate
                        as the American people themselves are. Our policies should be shaped with
                        the participation of Congress, from the outset, on a bipartisan basis. And
                        they should emerge from broad and well-informed public debate and
                        participation.</p>
                    <p>Second, our policies should treat the people of other nations as individuals,
                        with the same dignity and respect as we demand for ourselves. No matter
                        where they live, no matter who they are, the people of other lands are just
                        as concerned with the struggles of daily life as you and I. They work hard,
                        they have families whom they love, and they have hopes and dreams, and a
                        great deal of pride. And they want to live in peace. Their basic personal
                        motives are the same as ours.</p>
                    <p rend="center">
                        <hi rend="italic">Support Humanitarian Aspirations</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Third, it must be the responsibility of the President to restore the moral
                        authority of this country in its conduct of foreign policy. We should work
                        for peace and the control of arms in everything we do. We should support the
                        humanitarian aspirations of the world’s people. Policies that strengthen
                        dictators or create refugees, policies that prolong suffering or postpone
                        racial justice, weaken that authority. Policies that encourage economic
                        progress and social justice promote it. In an <pb n="19" facs="0060"
                            xml:id="pg_19"/>age when almost all of the world’s people are tied
                        together by instant communication, the image of a country, as seen through
                        its policies, has a great deal to do with what it can accomplish through the
                        traditional channels of diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>Fourth, our policies should be aimed at building a just and peaceful world
                        order, in which every nation can have a constructive role. For too long, our
                        foreign policy has consisted almost entirely of maneuver and manipulation,
                        based on the assumption that the world is a jungle of competing national
                        antagonisms, where military supremacy and economic muscle are the only
                        things that work and where rival powers are balanced against each other to
                        keep the peace.</p>
                    <p>Exclusive reliance on this strategy is not in keeping with the character of
                        the American people, or with the world as it is today. Balance of power
                        politics may have worked in 1815, or even 1945, but it has a much less
                        significant role in today’s world. Of course, there are rivalries—racial,
                        religious, national, some of them bitter. But the need for cooperation, even
                        between rivals, goes deeper than all of them.</p>
                    <p>Every nation has a stake in stopping the pollution of the seas and the air.
                        Every nation wants to be free from the threat of blackmail by international
                        terrorists and hijackers. Every nation, including those of <gloss
                            target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss>, sits on limited resources of energy
                        that are running out. The vast majority of countries, including the Soviet
                        Union, do not grow enough food to feed their own people. Every nation’s
                        economy benefits from expanding two-way trade. And everyone—except perhaps
                        the speculator—has a stake in a fair and reliable international monetary
                        system.</p>
                    <p>Our diplomatic agenda must also include preventing the spread of nuclear
                        weapons and controlling the flow of narcotics.</p>
                    <p>In the future, we must turn our attention increasingly toward these common
                        problems of food, energy, environment, and trade. A stable world order
                        cannot become a reality when people of many nations of the world suffer mass
                        starvation or when there are no established arrangements to deal with
                        population growth or environmental quality. The intensity of these
                        interrelated problems is rapidly increasing and better mechanisms for
                        consultation on these problems that affect everyone on this planet must be
                        established and utilized.</p>
                    <p>While the American people have had their fill of military adventurism and
                        covert manipulation, we have not retreated into isolationism. We realize
                        that increased anarchy will not only reverse the progress toward peace and
                        stability that we have made, but also strengthen the hand of our
                        adversaries.</p>
                    <p>That is why we must replace balance of power politics with world order
                        politics. The new challenge to American foreign policy is to take the lead
                        in joining the other nations of the world to build a just and stable
                        international order.</p>
                    <pb n="20" facs="0061" xml:id="pg_20"/>
                    <p>We need to reorder our diplomatic priorities. In recent years, we have paid
                        far more attention to our adversaries than to our friends, and we have been
                        especially neglectful of our neighbors in Latin America.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>It is important to continue to seek agreements with the Russians and the
                        Chinese, especially in the control of weapons. Success there could mean life
                        instead of death for millions of people. But the divisions between us are
                        deep. The differences of history and ideology will not go away. It is too
                        much to expect that we can do much more in these relationships than reduce
                        the areas of irritation and conflict and lessen the danger of war.</p>
                    <p>Our nation should coordinate its policy with our friends—countries like the
                        democratic states of Europe, North America and Japan—those countries who
                        share with us common goals and aspirations. We should work in concert with
                        them. Ours are the fortunate countries of the world. But our continued
                        prosperity and welfare depend upon increased coordination of our policies.
                        If we can work together on goals which reflect the common needs and shared
                        values of our people, we can make our societies the strong and stable inner
                        core around which world cooperation, prosperity and peace can develop.</p>
                    <p>If we believe in the importance of this effort, we should make some changes.
                        We must both lead and collaborate at the same time. We must consult with
                        others more about our plans. The days of “<persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"

                        to ours.</p>
                    <p>Our policies toward the developing countries also need revision. For years,
                        we have either ignored them or treated them as pawns in the big power chess
                        game. Both approaches were deeply offensive to their people. The oil embargo
                        taught us that even the least developed nation will eventually have control
                        over its own natural resources and that <pb n="21" facs="0062"
                            xml:id="pg_21"/>those countries which, alone or together, can control
                        necessary commodities are a force that can neither be ignored or
                        manipulated.</p>
                    <p>An attitude of neglect and disrespect toward the developing nations of the
                        world is predicated in part on a sense of superiority toward others—a form
                        of racism. This is incompatible with the character of American people.</p>
                    <p>We need to enlist the cooperation of the developing nations, for when we
                        speak of the tasks of a stable world order, we include preventing the spread
                        of nuclear weapons, policing the world’s environment, controlling the flow
                        of narcotics and establishing international protection against acts of
                        terror. If three-quarters of the people of the world do not join in these
                        arrangements, they will not succeed.</p>
                    <p>Our policies toward the developing world must be tough-minded in the pursuit
                        of our legitimate interests. At the same time, these policies must be
                        patient in the recognition of their legitimate interests which have too
                        often been cast aside.</p>
                    <p>The developing world has, of course, a few leaders who are implacably hostile
                        to anything the United States does. But the majority of its leaders are
                        moderate men and women who are prepared to work with us. When we ignore the
                        Third World, as we have for so long, the extremists will usually have their
                        way. But if we offer programs based on common interests, we can make common
                        cause with most of their leadership.</p>
                    <p>Our program of international aid to developing nations should be redirected
                        so that it meets the minimum human needs of the greatest number of people.
                        This means an emphasis on food, jobs, education, and public health—including
                        access to family planning. The emphasis in aid should be on those countries
                        with a proven ability to help themselves, instead of those that continue to
                        allow enormous discrepancies in living standards among their people. The
                        time has come to stop taxing poor people in rich countries for the benefit
                        of rich people in poor countries.</p>
                    <p>In our trade relations with these nations we should join commodity agreements
                        in such items as tin, coffee, and sugar which will assure adequate supplies
                        to consumers, protect our people from inflation, and at the same time stop
                        the fluctuation in prices that can cause such hardship and uncertainty in
                        single-commodity countries.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Economic Development Challenges</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The burden of economic development is going to be a heavy one. There are many
                        countries which ought to share it, not only in Europe and Asia but in the
                        Mideast. Today, a greater proportion of royalties from oil can be channeled
                        to the Third World by international institutions. Tomorrow, they can receive
                        a part of the profits from the mining <pb n="22" facs="0063" xml:id="pg_22"
                        />of the seas. The purpose of such development is not to level the economic
                        lot of every person on earth. It is to inject the wealth-creating process
                        into countries that are now stagnant; it is to help developing countries to
                        act in what is their own best interest as well as ours—produce more food,
                        limit population growth, and expand markets, supplies, and materials. It is
                        simply to give every country a sufficient stake in the international order
                        so that it feels no need to act as an outlaw. It is to advance the cause of
                        human dignity.</p>
                    <p>We must also work with the countries of the communist world. The policy of
                        East-West détente is under attack today because of the way it has been
                        exploited by the Soviet Union. The American people were told it would mean a
                        “generation of peace,” at no risk to the nation’s vital interests. And yet,
                        in places like Syria or Angola, in activities like offensive missile
                        development, the Soviets seem to be taking advantage of the new relationship
                        to expand their power and influence, and increase the risk of conflict.</p>
                    <p>I support the objectives of détente, but I cannot go along with the way it
                        has been handled by Presidents <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>. The Secretary of State has
                        tied its success too closely to his personal reputation. As a result, he is
                        giving up too much and asking for too little. He is trumpeting achievements
                        on paper while failing to insist on them in practice.</p>
                    <p>The relationship of détente is one of both cooperation and competition, of
                        new kinds of contacts in some areas along with continued hostility in
                        others. In the troubled history of our relationships with the Soviet Union,
                        this is where we have arrived. The benefits of détente must accrue to both
                        sides, or they are worthless. Their mutual advantage must be apparent, or
                        the American people will not support the policy.</p>
                    <p>To the Soviets, détente is an opportunity to continue the process of world
                        revolution without running the threat of nuclear war. They have said so
                        quite openly, as recently as 1 month ago at their 25th Party Congress.<note

                        of the American people.</p>
                    <p>But while détente must become more reciprocal, I reject the strident and
                        bellicose voices of those who would have this country return to the days of
                        the cold war with the Soviet Union. I believe the American people want to
                        look to the future. They have seen the tragedy of American involvement in
                        Vietnam and drawn appropriate lessons for tomorrow. They seek new vistas,
                        not a repetition of old rhetoric and old mistakes.</p>
                    <p>It is in our interest to try to make détente broader and more reciprocal.
                        Détente can be an instrument for long-term peaceful change within the
                        Communist system, as well as in the rest of the world. We should make it
                        clear that détente requires that the Soviets, as well as the United States,
                        refrain from irresponsible intervention in other countries. The Russians
                        have no more business in Angola than we have.</p>

                        the present <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> ceilings on offensive
                        weapons before both sides start a new arms race to reach the current
                        maximums, and before new missile systems are tested or committed for
                        production.</p>
                    <p>I am not afraid of hard bargaining with the Soviet Union. Hard bargaining
                        will strengthen support for the agreements that can be reached, and will
                        show that we, as well as they, can gain from détente. We can increase the
                        possibility that the fear of war and the burden of arms may be lifted from
                        the shoulders of humanity by the nations that have done the most to place it
                        there.</p>
                    <p>Our vision must be of a more pluralistic world and not of a Communist
                        monolith. We must pay more attention to China and to Eastern Europe. It is
                        in our interest and in the interest of world peace to promote a more
                        pluralistic Communist world.</p>
                    <p>We should remember that Eastern Europe is not an area of stability and it
                        will not become such until the Eastern European countries regain their
                        independence and become part of a larger cooperative European framework. I
                        am concerned over the long-range prospects for Rumanian and Yugoslavian
                        independence, and I deplore the recent infliction upon Poland of a
                        constitution that ratifies its status as a Soviet satellite. We must
                        reiterate to the Soviets that an enduring American-Soviet détente cannot
                        ignore the legitimate aspirations of other nations. We must likewise insist
                        that the Soviet Union and other countries recognize the human rights of all
                        citizens who live within their boundaries, whether they be blacks in
                        Rhodesia, Asians in Uganda, or Jews in the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <pb n="24" facs="0065" xml:id="pg_24"/>
                    <p>Our relations with China are important to world peace and they directly
                        affect the world balance. The United States has a great stake in a
                        nationally independent, secure, and friendly China. The present turmoil in
                        Chinese domestic politics could be exploited by the Soviets to promote a
                        Sino-Soviet reconciliation which might be inimical to international
                        stability and to American interests. I believe that we should explore more
                        actively the possibility of widening American-Chinese trade relations and of
                        further consolidating our political relationships.</p>
                    <p>The Middle East is a key testing area for our capacity to construct a more
                        cooperative international system. I believe deeply that a Middle East peace
                        settlement is essential to American interests, to Israel’s long-range
                        survival and to international cooperation. Without a settlement, the region
                        will become increasingly open to Soviet influence and more susceptible to
                        radical violence. I believe that the United States should insure Israel’s
                        security while at the same time encourage both sides to address themselves
                        to the substance of a genuine settlement.</p>
                    <p>There is no question that both Africa and Latin America have been ignored
                        since the Presidencies of <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">John
                            Kennedy</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Lyndon
                            Johnson</persName>. These areas should become, and indeed will become,
                        increasingly important in the next decade. Our relationships with these must
                        abandon traditional paternalism. The United States-Brazilian agreement,
                        signed recently by Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> on his trip to Latin America, is a good example of
                        our present policy at its worst. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName>’s remarks during his visit that “there are no two
                        people whose concern for human dignities and for the basic values of man is
                        more profound in day-to-day life than Brazil and the United States” can only
                        be taken as a gratuitous slap in the face of all those Americans who want a
                        foreign policy that embodies our ideals, not subverts them.<note n="8"

                    </p>
                    <p>If our aim is to construct an international order, we must also work through
                        the international bodies that now exist. On many of these issues, they are
                        the only places where nations regularly come together. We have all been
                        deeply disturbed by the drift of the United Nations and the other
                        international organizations, and by the acrimony and cliquishness that seem
                        to have taken hold. But it would be a mistake to give up on the United
                        Nations.</p>
                    <p>In the future, we should make multilateral diplomacy a major part of our
                        efforts so that other countries know in advance the importance the United
                        States attaches to their behavior in the United Nations and <pb n="25"
                            facs="0066" xml:id="pg_25"/>other international organizations. We should
                        make a major effort at reforming and restructuring the U.N. systems.</p>
                    <p rend="center">
                        <hi rend="italic">We Must Analyze International Institutions</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>We should undertake a systematic political and economic cost-benefit analysis
                        of existing international institutions in the United Nations systems and
                        outside, with a view to determining the appropriate level of U.S. support.
                        We should end the current diplomatic isolation of the United States in
                        international forums by working more closely with our allies and with
                        moderate elements in the developing world on a basis of mutual understanding
                        consistent with our respective national interests.</p>
                    <p>A stable world order cannot become a reality when people of many nations of
                        the world suffer mass starvation, when the countries with capital and
                        technology belligerently confront other nations for the control of raw
                        materials and energy sources, when open and nondiscriminatory trade has
                        become the exception rather than the rule, when there are no established
                        arrangements for supplying the world’s food and energy, nor for governing
                        control and development of the seas, and when there are no effective efforts
                        to deal with population explosions or environmental quality. The intensity
                        of these interrelated problems is rapidly increasing and better mechanisms
                        for consultation on these problems that affect everyone on this planet must
                        be established and utilized.</p>
                    <p>For it is likely that in the future, the issues of war and peace will be more
                        a function of economic and social problems than of the military security
                        problems which have dominated international relations since 1945.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I said I would touch on the kind of people we need to administer our
                        foreign policy. I believe that the foreign policy spokesman of our country
                        should be the President, and not the Secretary of State. The conduct of
                        foreign policy should be a sustained process of decision and action, and not
                        a series of television spectaculars. Under the current administration, the
                        agencies which are supposed to conduct our foreign affairs have been largely
                        wasted and demoralized. They must be revitalized and if necessary
                        reorganized—to upgrade their performance, their quality, and the morale of
                        their personnel.</p>
                    <p>In our search for peace we must call upon the best talent we can find in the
                        universities, the business world, labor, the professions, and the scientific
                        community. Appointments to our U.N. delegation, to other diplomatic posts,
                        and to international conferences should be made exclusively on a merit
                        basis, in contrast to the political patronage that has characterized
                        appointments under this administration.</p>
                    <pb n="26" facs="0067" xml:id="pg_26"/>
                    <p>The world needs a strong America and a confident America. We cannot and
                        should not avoid a role of world leadership. But our leadership should not
                        be based just on military might or economic power or political pressure, but
                        also on truth, justice, equality, and a true representation of the moral
                        character of our people.</p>
                    <p>From this leadership the world can derive mutual peace and progress.</p>

                        Commission’s director.</p>
                    <p>As I said in my address in Ottawa, the international context in which the
                        Commission was established has changed significantly since its
                            creation.<note n="3" xml:id="d5fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s address is printed

                            Trilateral Commission, 1976), pp. 15–16.</note> While relations between
                        the trilateral countries themselves are considerably freer of friction than
                        they were in 1973, greater uncertainty clouds the East-West relationship and
                        the salience of relations between the developed and the developing worlds to
                        political and economic stability has been more clearly established.
                        Throughout the period, I think it is fair to say that the Commission has
                        been in the forefront of those who have sought to intensify cooperation
                        between the <pb n="27" facs="0068" xml:id="pg_27"/>trilateral countries and
                        to propose progressive reforms in relations between North and South. Quite
                        apart from the influence which it may have had in this way, the Commission
                        has increasingly become an effective and recognized organization in which
                        major problems of topical and political importance can be discussed in a
                        policy-oriented fashion.</p>
                    <p>As I suggested in Ottawa, the uncertainties currently hanging over the
                        East-West relationship make it appropriate that the Commission should begin
                        its new phase by paying also some attention to relations with the Communist
                        countries. I think it is also important to sustain the work that we have
                        done in the North-South area. In this way we can contribute to insuring that
                        the improvement in the tone of the discussions between the developed and the
                        developing countries is translated into practical, longer range measures
                        which can avert the threat of serious North-South turbulence.</p>
                    <p>I fear that otherwise North-South tensions might interact dangerously with
                        East-West conflicts in such areas as the Middle East or Southern Africa. In
                        general, this potential intersection of East-West and North-South conflicts
                        deserves our closer attention. It represents a novel and an ominous
                        development on the world scene.</p>
                    <p>I also proposed in Ottawa that now that the members of the Commission have
                        established a good working relationship with one another, we might consider
                        broadening the circle of those involved in our work by inviting guests to
                        our meetings, possibly including some governmental representatives. I also
                        suggested that in the future our task forces might give slightly lower
                        priority to achieving consensus so as to provide more scope for originality.
                        We shall be looking at these and other ideas for changing and improving the
                        operation of the Commission during the coming weeks and months. We would
                        welcome any comments and suggestions which you may have in this
                        connection.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I would like to thank you for your interest and support in the
                        Commission in its first three years. There is no doubt that during that time
                        the idea of trilateralism has increasingly taken root in the consciousness
                        of the leaderships, in and out of government, in our three regions. This has
                        been an important change and one to which our efforts have, I believe, made
                        a major contribution. For the future, our task will be to build on this
                        initial success and ensure that the trilateral idea does not become frozen
                        but remains flexible and relevant to changing international conditions. I
                        look forward to continuing with you in this work.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">An address on Relations Between the World’s Democracies
                            was delivered by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> at
                            a luncheon of the Foreign Policy Association in New York City, N.Y.,
                            June 23, 1976. He said:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>For the past seventeen months, as a candidate for President, I have talked
                        and listened to the American people.</p>
                    <p>It has been an unforgettable experience and an invaluable education. Insofar
                        as my political campaign has been successful, it is because I have learned
                        from our people, and have accurately reflected their concerns, their
                        frustrations, and their desires.</p>
                    <p>In the area of foreign policy, our people are troubled, confused and
                        sometimes angry. There has been too much emphasis on transient spectaculars
                        and too little on substance. We are deeply concerned, not only by such
                        obvious tragedies as the war in Vietnam, but by the more subtle erosion in
                        the focus and the morality of our foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>Under the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>-<persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> Administration, there has evolved a
                        kind of secretive “Lone Ranger” foreign policy—a one-man policy of
                        international adventure. This is not an appropriate policy for America.</p>
                    <p>We have sometimes tried to play other nations one against another instead of
                        organizing free nations to share world responsibility in collective action.
                        We have made highly publicized efforts to woo the major communist powers
                        while neglecting our natural friends and allies. A foreign policy based on
                        secrecy inherently has had to be closely guarded and amoral, and we have had
                        to forego openness, consultation and a constant adherence to fundamental
                        principles and high moral standards.</p>
                    <p>We have often sought dramatic and surprising, immediate results instead of
                        long-term solutions to major problems which required careful planning in
                        consultation with other nations.</p>
                    <pb n="29" facs="0070" xml:id="pg_29"/>
                    <p>We must be strong in our internal resolve in order to be strong leaders
                        abroad. This is not possible when Congress and the American people are kept
                        in the dark. We simply <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have an <hi rend="italic"
                            >international policy of democratic leadership</hi>, and we must stop
                        trying to play a lonely game of power politics. We must evolve and
                        consummate our foreign policy openly and frankly. There must be bipartisan
                        harmony and collaboration between the President and the Congress, and we
                        must reestablish a spirit of common purpose among democratic nations.</p>
                    <p>What we seek is for our nation to have a foreign policy that reflects the
                        decency and generosity and common sense of our own people.</p>
                    <p>We had such a policy more than a hundred years ago and, in our own lifetimes,
                        in the years following the Second World War.</p>
                    <p>The United Nations, The Marshall Plan, The Bretton Woods Agreement, NATO,
                        Point Four, The OECD, The Japanese Peace Treaty—these were among the
                        historic achievements of a foreign policy directed by courageous Presidents,
                        endorsed by bipartisan majorities in Congress, and supported by the American
                        people.</p>
                    <p>The world since that time has become profoundly different, and the pace of
                        change is accelerating.</p>
                    <p>There are one hundred new nations and two billion more people.</p>
                    <p>East-West tensions may be less acute, but the East-West rivalry has become
                        global in scope.</p>
                    <p>Problems between the developed and developing nations have grown more
                        serious, and in some regions have come to intersect dangerously with the
                        East-West rivalry.</p>
                    <p>Economic nationalism complicates international relations, and unchecked
                        inflation may again threaten our mutual well-being.</p>
                    <p>Finally, such global dilemmas as food shortages, overpopulation and poverty
                        call for a common response, in spite of national and philosophical
                        differences.</p>
                    <p>It is imperative, therefore, that the United States summon the leadership
                        that can enable the democratic societies of the world once again to lead the
                        way in creating a more just and more stable world order.</p>
                    <p>In recent weeks, I have made speeches on the subject of nuclear proliferation
                        and also on the Middle East.<note n="2" xml:id="d6fn2">

                    <p>Today I would like to speak about our alliances, and ways they can be
                        improved to serve our national interests and the interests of others who
                        seek peace and stability in the world.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Partnership With Europe, Japan</p>
                    <p>We need to consider how—in addition to alliances that were formed in years
                        past for essentially military purposes—we might develop broader arrangements
                        for dealing with such problems as the arms race and world poverty and the
                        allocation of resources.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The time has come for us to seek a partnership between
                            North America, Western Europe and Japan.</hi> Our three regions share
                        economic, political and security concerns that make it logical that we
                        should seek ever-increasing unity and understanding.</p>
                    <p>I have traveled in Japan and Western Europe in recent years and talked to
                        leaders there. These countries already have a significant world impact, and
                        they are prepared to play even larger global roles in shaping a new
                        international order.</p>
                    <p>There are those who say that democracy is dying, that we live in the twilight
                        of an era, and that the destiny of modern man is to witness the waning of
                        freedom.</p>
                    <p>In Japan, Western Europe, Canada, some countries in Latin America, Israel,
                        and among many other people, I have found not a decline of democracy but a
                        dynamic commitment to its principles.</p>
                    <p>I might add that I can testify personally to the vigor of the democratic
                        process in our own country.</p>
                    <p>In addition to cooperation between North America, Japan and Western Europe,
                        there is an equal need for increased unity and consultation between
                        ourselves and such democratic societies as Israel, Australia, New Zealand,
                        and other nations, such as those in this hemisphere, that share our
                        democratic values, as well as many of our political and economic
                        concerns.</p>
                    <p>There must be more frequent consultations on many levels. We should have
                        periodic summit conferences and occasional meetings of the leaders of all
                        the industrial democracies, as well as frequent cabinet level meetings. In
                        addition, as we do away with one-man diplomacy, we must once again use our
                        entire foreign policy apparatus to reestablish continuing contacts at all
                        levels. Summits are no substitute for the habit of cooperating closely at
                        the working level.</p>
                    <p>In consultations, both form and substance are important. There is a
                        fundamental difference between informing governments after the fact and
                        actually including them in the process of joint policy making. Our policy
                        makers have in recent years far too often ignored this basic dif<pb n="31"

                    </p>
                    <p>We need to recognize also that in recent years our Western European allies
                        have been deeply concerned, and justly so, by our unilateral dealings with
                        the Soviet Union. To the maximum extent possible, our dealings with the
                        communist powers should reflect the combined view of the democracies and
                        thereby avoid suspicions by our allies that we may be disregarding their
                        interests.</p>

                    <p>There are at least three areas in which the democratic nations can benefit
                        from closer and more creative relations.</p>
                    <p>First, there are our economic and political affairs.</p>
                    <p>In the realm of economics, our basic purpose must be to <hi rend="italic"
                            >keep open the international system</hi> in which the exchange of goods,
                        capital, and ideas among nations can continue to expand.</p>
                    <p rend="center">“Must Avoid Unilateral Acts”</p>
                    <p>Increased coordination among the industrialized democracies can help avoid
                        the repetition of such episodes as the inflation of 1972–73 and the more
                        recent recessions. Both were made more severe by an excess of expansionist
                        zeal and then of deflationary reaction in North America, Japan and
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>Though each country must make its own economic decisions, we need to know
                        more about one another’s interests and intentions. We must avoid unilateral
                        acts, and we must try not to work at cross-purposes in the pursuit of the
                        same ends. We need not agree on all matters, but we should agree to discuss
                        all matters.</p>
                    <p>We should continue our efforts to reduce trade barriers among the industrial
                        countries, as one way to combat inflation. The current Tokyo round of

                        of any early return to fixed exchange rates—divergencies in economic
                        experience among nations are too great for that. But we still have much to
                        learn regarding the effective operation of a system of fluctuating exchange
                        rates. We must take steps to avoid large and erratic fluctuations, without
                        impeding the basic monetary adjustments that will be necessary among nations
                        for some years to come. It will be useful to strengthen the role of the
                        International Monetary Fund as a center for observation and guidance of the
                        world economy, keeping track of the interactions among national economies
                        and making recommendations to governments on how best to keep the world
                        economy functioning smoothly.</p>
                    <p>Beyond economic and political cooperation, we have much to learn from one
                        another. I have been repeatedly impressed by the achievements of the
                        Japanese and the Europeans in their domestic affairs. The Japanese, for
                        example, have one of the lowest unemployment rates and the lowest crime rate
                        of any industrialized nation, and they also seem to suffer less than other
                        urbanized peoples from the modern problem of rootlessness and
                        alienation.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, we can learn from the European nations about health care, urban
                        planning and mass transportation.</p>
                    <p>There are many ways that creative alliances can work for a better world. Let
                        us mention just one more, the area of human rights. Many of us have
                        protested the violation of human rights in Russia, and justly so. But such
                        violations are not limited to any one country or one ideology. There are
                        other countries that violate human rights in one way or another—by torture,
                        by political persecution, and by racial or religious discrimination.</p>
                    <p>We and our allies, in a creative partnership, can take the lead in
                        establishing and promoting basic global standards of human rights. We
                        respect the independence of all nations, but by our example, by our
                        utterances, and by the various forms of economic and political persuasion
                        available to us, we can quite surely lessen the injustice in this world.</p>
                    <p>We must certainly try.</p>
                    <p>Let me make one other point in the political realm. Democratic processes may
                        in some countries bring to power parties or leaders whose ideologies are not
                        shared by most Americans.</p>
                    <p>We may not welcome these changes; we will certainly not encourage them. But
                        we must respect the results of democratic elections and the right of
                        countries to make their own free choice if we are to re<pb n="33"
                            facs="0074" xml:id="pg_33"/>main faithful to our own basic ideals. We
                        must learn to live with diversity, and we can continue to cooperate, so long
                        as such political parties respect the democratic process, uphold existing
                        international commitments, and are not subservient to external political
                        direction. The democratic concert of nations should exclude only those who
                        exclude themselves by the rejection of democracy itself.</p>
                    <p>Our people have now learned the folly of our trying to inject our power into
                        the internal affairs of other nations. It is time that our government
                        learned that lesson too.</p>
                    <p>While it is too early to appraise the ultimate result of the weekend’s
                        elections in Italy, and though the outcome is a source of some relief since
                        the Communist Party failed to obtain the plurality, it is clear that Italian
                        political problems have been caused by the underlying social malaise of the
                            country.<note n="6" xml:id="d6fn6">Elections took place in Italy the

                        will require not only a major act of will on the part of Italian political
                        leadership, but patient and significant assistance from Italy’s Western
                        European neighbors, as well as from the United States. We must give our most
                        alert and sympathetic consideration to such needed assistance.</p>
                    <p rend="center">On Mutual Security</p>
                    <p>The second area of increased cooperation among the democracies is that of <hi
                            rend="italic">mutual security.</hi> Here, however, we must recognize
                        that the Atlantic and Pacific regions have quite different needs and
                        different political sensitivities.</p>
                    <p>Since the United States is both an Atlantic and a Pacific power, our
                        commitments to the security of Western Europe and of Japan are inseparable
                        from our own security. Without these commitments, and our firm dedication to
                        them, the political fabric of Atlantic and Pacific cooperation would be
                        seriously weakened, and world peace endangered.</p>
                    <p>As we look to the Pacific region, we see a number of changes and
                        opportunities. Because of potential Sino-Soviet conflict, Russian and
                        Chinese forces are not jointly deployed as our potential adversaries, but
                        confront one another along their common border. Moreover, our withdrawal
                        from the mainland of Southeast Asia has made possible improving
                        relationships between us and the People’s Republic of China.</p>
                    <p>With regard to our primary Pacific ally, Japan, we will maintain our existing
                        security arrangements, so long as that continues to be the wish of the
                        Japanese people and government.</p>
                    <pb n="34" facs="0075" xml:id="pg_34"/>
                    <p>I believe it will be possible to withdraw our ground forces from South Korea
                        on a phased basis over a time span to be determined after consultation with
                        both South Korea and Japan. At the same time, it should be made clear to the
                        South Korean Government that its internal oppression is repugnant to our
                        people, and undermines the support for our commitment there.</p>
                    <p>We face a more immediate problem in the Atlantic sector of our defense.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union has in recent years strengthened its forces in Central
                        Europe. The Warsaw Pact forces facing <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        today are substantially composed of Soviet combat troops, and these troops
                        have been modernized and reinforced. In the event of war, they are postured
                        for an all-out conflict of short duration and great intensity.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s ground combat forces are largely
                        European. The U.S. provides about one-fifth of the combat element, as well
                        as the strategic umbrella, and without this American commitment, Western
                        Europe could not defend itself successfully.</p>
                    <p>In recent years, new military technology has been developed by both sides,
                        including precision-guided munitions that are changing the nature of land
                        warfare.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s arsenal suffers from
                        a lack of standardization, which needlessly increases the cost of <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, and its strategy too often seems wedded
                        to past plans and concepts. We must not allow our alliance to become an
                        anachronism.</p>
                    <p>There is, in short, a pressing need for us and our allies to undertake a
                        review of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s forces and its strategies
                        in light of the changing military environment.</p>
                    <p>A comprehensive program to develop, procure, and equip <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> with the more accurate air defense and
                        anti-tank weapons made possible by new technology is needed to increase
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s defensive power. Agreement on
                        stockpiles and on the prospective length of any potential conflict is
                        necessary. We should also review the structure of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> reserve forces so they can be committed to combat
                        sooner.</p>
                    <p>In all of this a major European and joint effort will be required. Our people
                        will not support unilateral American contributions in what must be a truly
                        mutual defense effort.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Cooperative, Competitive Relations</p>
                    <p>Even as we review our military posture, we must spare no effort to bring

                            meeting took place in Vienna in October 1973. See <ref

                        it is an important requirement for the maintenance of security in
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, in the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> talks, we must seek
                        significant nuclear disarmament that safeguards the basic interests of both
                        sides.</p>
                    <p>Let me say something I have often said in recent months. East-West relations
                        will be both cooperative and competitive for a long time to come. We want
                        the competition to be peaceful, and we want the cooperation to increase. <hi
                            rend="italic">But we will never seek accommodation at the expense of our
                            own national interests or the interests of our allies.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Our potential adversaries are intelligent people. They respect strength; they
                        respect constancy; they respect candor. They will understand our commitment
                        to our allies. They will listen even more carefully if we and our allies
                        speak with a common resolve.</p>
                    <p>We must remember, too, that a genuine spirit of cooperation between the
                        democracies and the Soviet Union should extend beyond a negative cessation
                        of hostilities and reach toward joint efforts in dealing with such world
                        problems as agricultural development and the population crisis.</p>
                    <p>The great challenge we Americans confront is to demonstrate to the Soviet
                        Union that our good will is as great as our strength until, despite all the
                        obstacles, our two nations can achieve new attitudes and new trust, and
                        until, in time, the terrible burden of the arms race can be lifted from our
                        peoples.</p>
                    <p>One realistic step would be to recognize that thus far, while we have had
                        certain progress on a bilateral basis, we have continued to confront each
                        other by proxy in various trouble spots. These indirect challenges may be
                        potentially more dangerous than face to face disagreements, and at best they
                        make mockery of the very concept of détente. If we want genuine progress, it
                        must be at every level.</p>
                    <p>Our democracies must also work together more closely in a joint effort to
                        help the hundreds of millions of people on this planet who are living in
                        poverty and despair.</p>
                    <p>We have all seen the growth of North-South tensions in world affairs,
                        tensions that are often based on legitimate economic grievances. We have
                        seen in the Middle East the juncture of East-West and North-South conflicts
                        and the resultant threat to world peace.</p>
                    <p>The democratic nations must respond to the challenge of human needs on three
                        levels.</p>

                    <p>First, by widening the opportunities for genuine North-South consultations.
                        The developing nations must not only be the objects of policy, but must
                        participate in shaping it. Without wider consultations we will have sharper
                        confrontations. A good start has been made with the Conference on
                        International Economic Cooperation which should be strengthened and
                            widened.<note n="8" xml:id="d6fn8">The Conference on International

                    <p>There are many ways the democracies can unite to help shape a more stable and
                        just world order. We can work to lower trade barriers and make a major

                    <p>I might add, on the subject of foreign aid, that while we are a generous
                        nation we are not a foolish nation, and our people will expect recipient
                        nations to undertake needed reforms to promote their own development.
                        Moreover, all nations must recognize that the North-South relationship is
                        not made easier by one-sided self-righteousness, by the exercise of
                        automatic majorities in world bodies, nor by intolerance for the views or
                        the very existence of other nations.</p>
                    <p rend="center">“Limit the Flow of Arms”</p>
                    <p>Third, we and our allies must work together to limit the <hi rend="italic"

                    <p>The North-South conflict is in part a security problem. As long as the more
                        powerful nations exploit the less powerful, they will be repaid by
                        terrorism, hatred, and potential violence. Insofar as our policies are
                        selfish, or cynical, or shortsighted, there will inevitably be a day of
                        reckoning.</p>
                    <p>I am particularly concerned by our nation’s role as the world’s leading arms
                        salesman. We sold or gave away billions of dollars of arms last year, mostly
                        to developing nations. For example, we are now beginning to export advanced
                        arms to Kenya and Zaire, thereby both fueling the East-West arms race in
                        Africa even while supplanting our own allies—Britain and France—in their
                        relations with these African states. Sometimes we try to justify this
                        unsavory business on the cynical ground that by rationing out the means of
                        violence we can somehow control the world’s violence.</p>
                    <p>The fact is that we cannot have it both ways. <hi rend="italic">Can</hi> we
                        be both the world’s leading champion of peace and the world’s leading
                        supplier of the weapons of war? If I become President, I will work with our
                        allies, some of whom are also selling arms, and also seek to work with the
                        Soviets, to increase the emphasis on peace and to reduce the commerce in
                        weapons of war.</p>
                    <p>The challenge we and our allies face with regard to the developing nations is
                        a great one, a constant one, and an exciting one. It is exciting because it
                        calls for so much creativity at so many levels by so many nations and
                        individuals.</p>
                    <p>I have suggested steps which we and our allies might take toward a more
                        stable and more just world order. I do not pretend to have all the answers.
                        I hope you will help me find them.</p>
                    <p>What I do have is a strong sense that this country is drifting and must have
                        new leadership and new direction. The time has come for a new thrust of
                        creativity in foreign policy equal to that of the years following the Second
                        World War. The old international institutions no longer suffice. <hi
                            rend="italic">The time has come for a new architectural effort, with

                            justice its constant goal.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>We are in a time of challenge and opportunity. If the values we cherish are
                        to be preserved—the ideals of liberty and dignity and opportunity for all—we
                        shall have to work in the closest collaboration with like-minded nations,
                        seeking, through the strength that follows from collective action, to build
                        an international system that reflects the principles and standards of our
                        national heritage.</p>
                    <p>The primary purpose of our foreign policy is to create and maintain a world
                        environment within which our great experiment in freedom can survive and

                    <p>Ours would be a chilled and lonely world without the other democracies of
                        Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Israel and this hemisphere with whom
                        we share great common purposes. There is a special relationship among us
                        based not necessarily on a common heritage but on our partnership in great
                        enterprises. Our present limits are not those of natural resources but of
                        ideas and inspirations.</p>
                    <p>Our first great need is to restore the morale and spirit of the American

                    <p>On July 15, 1976, former Governor of Georgia <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Jimmy Carter</persName> accepted the Democratic nomination for
                        President and addressed delegates at the Democratic National Convention in
                        Madison Square Garden in New York. In his acceptance speech, <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> referenced the relationship
                        between security and peace and discussed the American character as it
                        related to U.S. interactions with the world:</p>
                    <p>“The foremost responsibility of any President, above all else, is to
                        guarantee the security of our nation—a guarantee of freedom from the threat
                        of successful attack or blackmail, and the ability with our allies to
                        maintain peace.</p>
                    <p>“But peace is not the mere absence of war. Peace is action to stamp out
                        international terrorism. Peace is the unceasing effort to preserve human
                        rights. Peace is a combined demonstration of strength and good will. We will
                        pray for peace and we will work for peace, until we have removed from all
                        nations for all time the threat of nuclear destruction.</p>
                    <p>“America’s birth opened a new chapter in mankind’s history. Ours was the
                        first nation to dedicate itself clearly to the basic moral and philosophical
                        principles: that all people are created equal and endowed with inalienable
                        rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and that the power of
                        government is derived from the consent of the governed.</p>
                    <p>“This national commitment was a singular act of wisdom and courage, and it
                        brought the best and bravest from other nations to our shores. It was a
                        revolutionary development that captured the imagination of mankind. It
                        created a basis for a unique role of America—that of <pb n="39" facs="0080"
                            xml:id="pg_39"/>a pioneer in shaping more decent and just relations
                        among people and among societies.</p>
                    <p>“Today, two hundred years later, we must address ourselves to that role, both
                        in what we do at home and how we act abroad—among people everywhere who have
                        become politically more alert, socially more congested, and increasingly
                        impatient with global inequities, and who are now organized, as you know,
                        into some one hundred and fifty different nations. This calls for nothing
                        less than a sustained architectural effort to shape an international
                        framework of peace within which our own ideals gradually can become a global
                        reality.</p>
                    <p>“Our nation should always derive its character directly from the people and
                        let this be the strength and the image to be presented to the world—the
                        character of the American people.</p>
                    <p>“To our friends and allies I say that what unites us through our common
                        dedication to democracy is much more important than that which occasionally
                        divides us on economics or politics. To the nations that seek to lift
                        themselves from poverty I say that America shares your aspirations and
                        extends its hand to you. To those nation-states that wish to compete with us
                        I say that we neither fear competition nor see it as an obstacle to wider
                        cooperation. To all people I say that after two hundred years America still
                        remains confident and youthful in its commitment to freedom and equality,
                        and we always will be.” (<hi rend="italic">The Presidential Campaign

                    <p>“Today we had a joint discussion about foreign affairs. We emphasized the
                        point that we are trying to learn as much as we possibly can about the
                        interrelationship between our nation and others so that we can present to
                        the world a foreign policy that is understood by the American people, which
                        is predictable, and which has an acknowledged purpose, which can have
                        bipartisan support, which can regain the trust of other nations in our
                        country and which can accurately represent the character of the American
                        people.</p>
                    <p>“We had specific discussions about the African nations, and particular
                        emphasis today throughout the discussions on the developing nations of the
                        world. Those who have been most sadly neglected in our own nation’s emphasis
                        in the past few years under Presidents <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                            >Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> and
                        Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>. I think this is the
                        first time, certainly, that any presidential candidate has ever spent so
                        much time studying the particular problems of the developing nations, but
                        there is a very legitimate reason for it because of the past neglect and
                        because of the importance—the crucial nature—for the future. We discussed
                        our relationship on an East-West basis specifically, of course, with the
                        People’s Republic of China and with the Soviet Union. We discussed the
                        Middle East and the Mediterranean area, and within the special framework of
                        the developing nations discussion, in addition to Africa we discussed
                        countries in our own hemisphere.</p>
                    <p>“We also tried to analyze the proper interrelationship derived from the
                        Monday [July 26] meeting between correlating defense policy establishment
                        and foreign policy—our political interrelationship with other countries. We
                        discussed some creative approaches to <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        II talks and we were particularly concerned in the Middle East in
                        emphasizing the fact that without a complete confidence in our own
                        government position on the Middle Eastern question, within Israel, that
                        there can be no, or very little, possibility of an ultimate settlement in
                        the Middle East. In other words, we have to have a consistent, unshakable,
                        unchanging commitment of support for Israel, and with that understanding and
                        acceptance within the Israeli nation that we can have a good hope for peace
                        in the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>“We also discussed our relationship with South Africa, and Rhodesia, with an
                        understanding that there would be no yielding on our part on the issue of
                        human rights and majority rule.</p>
                    <p>“The other point that we did discuss was South America. The fact that we
                        should get away permanently from an attitude of paternalism or punishment or
                        retribution when some of the South Americans didn’t yield to our persuasion.
                        There was a great revelation, to me at least, that within the Third World
                        nations, the developing world, the unique leadership role that has been
                        played by Mexico, Venezuela, and other Latin American leaders. I think the
                        Latin American nations must be treated <pb n="41" facs="0082" xml:id="pg_41"
                        />as individuals. They must be recognized as far as their own worldwide
                        leadership capabilities of influence. And to treat them in a paternalistic
                        manner, or just in the hemispheric relationship, would be a mistake.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> asked <persName
                            corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName> to discuss several additional
                        points. <persName corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName> responded:</p>
                    <p>“One of the other matters discussed was the very crucial importance of
                        establishing and maintaining an ongoing high-level consistent relationship
                        with our traditional allies in Western Europe, in Japan, and in Canada. This
                        is the bedrock of American foreign policy, and that the administration ought
                        to have that in mind at the highest level of priorities at all times. I
                        think that is a crucial part of any kind of foreign policy that represents
                        the best interest and ideals of the American people.</p>
                    <p>“We also talked about the crucial need to put a ceiling, not just on
                        strategic arms where we think much lower ceilings are clearly needed, but
                        also a similar ceiling on arms transfer of tactical armaments.</p>
                    <p>“Right now, as you know, the United States is the leading arms sales country
                        in the world. But in order to put that kind of restriction on the transfer
                        of arms, there must be an agreement reached between the Soviet Union,
                        between other countries such as West Germany, England, which sell armaments,
                        but also with the consuming countries, because this is a matter which arms
                        purchasing nations around the world have a direct interest. And it would be
                        our hope that we could move forward toward some international agreement
                        between those who sell arms and those who buy arms to bring a dramatic
                        reduction in the amount of the tragic, expensive arms sales that go on in
                        the world today.” (<hi rend="italic">The Presidential Campaign 1976,</hi>

                        <hi rend="italic">On September 8, 1976, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                                >Carter</persName> addressed a convention in Washington, D.C., of
                            B’nai B’rith, a national Jewish fraternal organization. He said:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is a special pleasure to be here today, because I believe we share a
                        common heritage, and a common commitment, that brings us together.</p>
                    <p>In 1843, B’nai B’rith was founded by a small group of immigrants who sought
                        to preserve for themselves and others the religious and personal liberty
                        they had been denied abroad.</p>
                    <p>So it was with those who founded my church in this country, to insure liberty
                        of conscience.</p>
                    <p>I am proud to meet with a group of men and women with whom I share a total
                        commitment to the preservation of human rights, individual liberty, and
                        freedom of conscience.</p>
                    <p>I would like to talk to you about my view of how our nation should encourage
                        and support those priceless qualities throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>This is, as you know, a difficult question. It requires a careful balancing
                        of realism and idealism—of our understanding of the world as it is, and our
                        vision of the world as it should be.</p>
                    <p>The question, I think, is whether in recent years our highest officials have
                        not been too pragmatic, even cynical, and as a consequence have ignored
                        those moral values that had often distinguished our country from the other
                        great nations of the world.</p>
                    <p>We must move away from making policies in secret; without the knowledge and
                        approval of the American people.</p>
                    <p>I have called for closer ties with our traditional allies, and stronger ties
                        with the State of Israel. I have stressed the necessity for a strong
                        defense—tough and muscular, and adequate to maintain our freedom under any
                        conceivable circumstances.</p>
                    <pb n="43" facs="0084" xml:id="pg_43"/>
                    <p>But military strength alone is not enough. Over the years, our greatest
                        source of strength has come from those basic, priceless values which are
                        embodied in our Declaration of Independence, our Constitution, and our Bill
                        of Rights: our belief in freedom of religion—our belief in freedom of
                        expression—our belief in human dignity.</p>
                    <p>These principles have made us great and, unless our foreign policy reflects
                        them, we make a mockery of all those values that we have celebrated in this
                        bicentennial year.</p>
                    <p>We have not always lived up to our ideals, but I know of no great nation in
                        history that has more often conducted itself in a moral, unselfish, generous
                        manner abroad, and provided more freedom and opportunity to its own citizens
                        at home.</p>
                    <p>Still, in recent years, we have had reason to be troubled. Often there has
                        been a gap between the values we have proclaimed and the policies we have
                        pursued. We have often been overextended, and deeply entangled in the
                        internal affairs of distant nations. Our government has pursued dubious
                        tactics, and “national security” has sometimes been a cover-up for
                        unnecessary secrecy and national scandal.</p>
                    <p>We stumbled into the quagmires of Cambodia and Vietnam, and carried out
                        heavy-handed efforts to destroy an elected government in Chile. In Cyprus,
                        we let expediency triumph over fairness, and lost both ways.</p>
                    <p>We responded inadequately to human suffering in Bangladesh, Burundi, the
                        Sahel, and other underdeveloped nations.</p>
                    <p>We lessened the prestige of our Foreign Service by sending abroad ambassadors
                        who were distinguished only by the size of their political
                        contributions.</p>
                    <p>We have allowed virtually unlimited sales of United States arms to countries
                        around the world—a policy as cynical as it is dangerous.</p>
                    <p>I find it unacceptable that we have in effect condoned the effort of some
                        Arab countries to tell American businesses that, in order to trade with one
                        country or company, they must observe certain restrictions based on race or
                        religion. These so-called “Arab boycotts” violate our standards of freedom
                        and morality.<note n="2" xml:id="d9fn2">In December 1945, the Arab League
                            declared a boycott on trade between Arab countries and Israel. The
                            boycott had evolved by 1948 to include three components: a continuation
                            of the original boycott, a boycott against any companies operating in
                            Israel, and a boycott against any companies that had relationships with
                            companies operating in Israel.</note>

                        countries of their choice, and I commend those Members of Congress and
                        others who have demonstrated a strong personal concern and commitment to
                        that goal.</p>
                    <p>Despite our deep desire for successful negotiation on strategic arms and
                        nuclear proliferation, we cannot pass over in silence the deprivation of
                        human rights in the Soviet Union. The list of Soviet prisoners is long, and
                        includes both Christians and Jews. I will speak only of two: <persName
                            corresp="#p_BV_1">Vladimir Bukovsky</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_SV_1">Vladimir Slepak</persName>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BV_1">Bukovsky</persName>, a young scientist, has been
                        imprisoned most of the last 13 years for criticisms of the Soviet regime.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SV_1">Slepak</persName>, a radio engineer in
                        Moscow, applied for an exit visa for Israel in April of 1970. The visa was
                        denied and, since 1972, he has been denied the right to hold a job.</p>
                    <p>I ask why such people must be deprived of their basic rights, a year after
                        Helsinki. And if I become President, the fate of men like <persName
                            corresp="#p_BV_1">Bukovsky</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SV_1"
                            >Slepak</persName> will be very much on my mind as I negotiate with the
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Liberty is curtailed in non-Communist countries, too, of course. There are
                        many cases of political persecution in Chile and reports of brutal torture
                        that are too well documented to be disbelieved.</p>
                    <p>There are those regimes, such as South Korea, which openly violate human
                        rights, although they themselves are under threat from Communist regimes
                        which represent an even greater level of repression.</p>
                    <p>Even in such cases, however, we should not condone repression or the denial
                        of freedom. On the contrary, we should use our influence to increase freedom
                        in those countries that depend on us for their very survival.</p>
                    <p>Denials of human rights occur in many places and many ways. In Ireland, for
                        example, violence has bred more violence, and caused untold human suffering
                        which brings sorrow to the entire civilized world.</p>
                    <p>I do not say to you that these are simple issues.</p>
                    <p>I do not say that we can remake the world in our own image. I recognize the
                        limits on our power, and I do not wish to see us swing from one extreme of
                        cynical manipulation to the other extreme of moralistic zeal, which can be
                        just as dangerous.</p>
                    <p>But the present administration has been so obsessed with balance of power
                        politics that it has often ignored basic American values and a proper
                        concern for human rights. The leaders of this administration have
                        rationalized that there is little room for morality in foreign affairs, and
                        that we must put self-interest above principle.</p>
                    <pb n="46" facs="0087" xml:id="pg_46"/>
                    <p>I disagree strongly.</p>
                    <p>Ours is a great and powerful nation, committed to certain enduring ideals and
                        those ideals must be reflected in our foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>There are practical, effective ways in which our power can be used to
                        alleviate human suffering around the world.</p>
                    <p>We should begin by having it understood that if any nation, whatever its
                        political system, deprives its people of basic human rights, that fact will
                        help shape our people’s attitude toward that nation’s government.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Respect for Human Rights</p>
                    <p>If other nations want our friendship and support, they must understand that
                        we want to see basic human rights respected.</p>
                    <p>Our power is not unlimited, but neither is it insignificant, and I believe
                        that if we are sensitive and if we are concerned, there can be many
                        instances when our power can make a crucial difference to thousands of men
                        and women who are the victims of oppression around the world.</p>
                    <p>We must be realistic. Although we believe deeply in our own system of
                        government and our own ideals, we do not and should not insist on identical
                        standards or an identical system in all other nations. We can live with
                        diversity in governmental systems, but we cannot look away when a government
                        tortures people, or jails them for their beliefs, or denies minorities fair
                        treatment or the right to emigrate.</p>
                    <p>Let me suggest some actions our government should take in the area of human
                        rights.</p>
                    <p>First, we can support the principle of self-determination by refraining from
                        intervention in the domestic politics of other countries but, obviously, we
                        are going to protect our interests and advance our beliefs in other
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>We should not behave abroad in ways that violate our own laws or moral
                        standards. You and I would not plot murder, but in recent years officials of
                        our government have plotted murder, and that is wrong and unacceptable.</p>
                    <p>In giving trade advantages or economic assistance to other governments, we
                        should make sure that such aid is used to benefit the people of that
                        country. There will be times when we will want to help those who must live
                        under a repressive government. We may refrain from giving general economic
                        aid or military assistance to a government, yet wish to provide food, health
                        care, or other humanitarian assistance directly to the people.</p>
                    <p>The United States should lend more vigorous support to the United Nations and
                        other public and private international bodies in <pb n="47" facs="0088"
                            xml:id="pg_47"/>order to attract world attention to the denial of
                        freedom. These bodies are limited in power, but they can serve as the
                        conscience of the world community, and they deserve far more support than
                        our government has given them in recent years.</p>
                    <p>Insofar as they comply with our own Constitution and laws, we should move
                        toward Senate ratification of several important treaties drafted in the
                        United Nations for the protection of human rights. These include the
                        Genocide Convention that was prepared more than 25 years ago,<note n="7"

                            signature on December 19. The first covenant commits signatories to
                            respecting the civil and political rights of individuals, including the
                            right to life; freedoms of speech, religion, and assembly; and right to

                            participation in cultural life, and the right to work. <persName

                        in domestic affairs we need leaders who are not only concerned with the
                        interests of the powerful, but who are especially concerned with the
                        powerless, with the weak, with the disenfranchised, and with other victims
                        of oppression. We have not had that kind of leadership in recent years.</p>

                    <p>Bearing the above in mind, I have a <hi rend="italic">concrete suggestion for
                            the debate, in order to set the tone for it</hi>:</p>
                    <p>1. If you are asked to make the opening response, use the initial part of the
                        first three minutes for stating that <hi rend="italic">whatever the question
                            is it has to be viewed in a larger context or perspective</hi>; then go
                        on to affirm that the major issue confronting us is the absence of effective
                        Presidential leadership and the related absence of a clear sense of
                        historical direction projected worldwide by America. You can then go on to
                        use the rest of the three minutes to answer the specific question and you
                        will have still additional two minutes as a follow-on.</p>
                    <pb n="49" facs="0090" xml:id="pg_49"/>
                    <p>2. If your opening comment involves a reaction to <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>’s response, you can use that
                        opportunity to raise the above theme very briefly, indicating to the public
                        that <hi rend="italic">this is the key question for Americans to
                        ponder</hi>, then attack <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> on the
                        specific question, and then use your own opening answer for a fuller
                        definition of the basic theme as suggested under #1 above.</p>
                    <p>3. Remember: your audience is the nation and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the
                        questioners. So focus on the <hi rend="italic">fundamentals</hi> and not
                        only on the questions—and keep hammering at the basic theme of no
                        Presidential leadership and of no American vision for a world that needs
                        direction and architecture.</p>
                    <p>4. In general, I feel that <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>’s
                        non-performance in this area ought to be attacked more sharply and more
                        pointedly than was the case with his domestic performance.</p>
                    <p>For example, on detente, does he agree with <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"

                            >Reagan</persName>? On Cyprus, he should be faulted in some detail for

                            to come from the Cypriot communities, although the United States would
                            assist in “restoring momentum to the negotiating process.” For the full

                        interest to the newspapermen. I would anticipate that these themes would
                        be:</p>

                    <p>You will probably be asked how you expect to negotiate more toughly with the
                        Russians, and what you propose to do to increase East European independence.
                        Your answers on these issues ought to be well-balanced: tough on
                        fundamentals but showing a willingness to accommodate. With regard to the
                        Russians, you might stress in general that domestically they are quite weak
                        (their economy is in difficulty, there is social unease, the non-Russian
                        nations are gradually becoming restless), and hence that they need a genuine
                        and <hi rend="italic">truly reciprocal</hi> detente quite as much as we.
                        This is not a matter of forcing them to change their system but of realizing
                        that we do not need to appear as needing the detente more than the
                        Russians.</p>
                    <p>On the East Europeans, you might first say that the Republican position on
                        Eastern Europe has been ambiguous, then go on to stress the importance to us
                        and to West Europe of both Romanian and Yugoslav independence, also
                        emphasize that it is in the general interest of Europe that countries such
                        as Poland become more autonomous. You could <pb n="51" facs="0092"
                            xml:id="pg_51"/>then follow by stressing that you would seek to deal
                        more directly with the East European states, rejecting the notion that
                        Eastern Europe is a Soviet sphere of influence and that all arrangements for
                        Eastern Europe have to be cleared or channeled through Moscow. Finally, you
                        might emphasize that you will insist on a scrupulous fulfillment of the
                        Helsinki Agreement,<note n="8" xml:id="d10fn8">See <ref target="#d4fn7"
                                >footnote 7, Document 4</ref>.</note> and that you will have a
                        special review process set up to monitor the extent to which this Agreement
                        has been fulfilled.</p>
                    <p>On the Middle East, the thing to stress would be the insecure nature of the
                        stalemate, the different things said by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> to the Arabs and the Israelis, and the uncertainty

                            need for continued cooperation among the industrialized economies in
                            four areas: noninflationary economic growth, international trade,
                            transnational investment, and cooperation in energy. With regard to the
                            last area, he noted: “For the next several years, our nations’ heavy
                            dependence on imported oil will contribute to our political and economic
                            vulnerability. The outlook for reducing our dependence in the next
                            decade is not encouraging.” He then referenced the current and projected
                            barrels per day figures, yet added that the industrial countries needed
                            to reduce their immediate dependence on imported oil and develop
                            alternative energy systems. (Department of State <hi rend="italic"

                    <p>I was in Europe in connection with my regular work. I met there a number of
                        people I know quite well (the Foreign Minister and President of Italy; the
                        principal foreign policy advisers to President Giscard; some top British and
                        German business and political leaders; as well as some key journalists).</p>
                    <pb n="53" facs="0094" xml:id="pg_53"/>
                    <p>I was struck by <hi rend="italic">the great expectations</hi> that the
                        Europeans seem to have regarding your prospective Presidency. There is a
                        striking sense of anticipation as well as curiosity. I was plied with
                        endless questions about you personally as well as about your likely
                        policies. (Needless to say, I made it very clear that I was <hi
                            rend="italic">not speaking</hi> for you).</p>
                    <p>One important impression that I gained was that there may be in the
                        foreseeable future real opportunity for a renewed and truly serious dialogue
                        between the U.S. and France on both East-West and North-South problems. The
                        French hinted that they would like to have serious discussions with us about
                        their nuclear policies; this could involve some accommodation on their part
                        with regards to their role in nuclear proliferation in return for some
                        consideration on our part for their strategic concerns.</p>
                    <p>I should add, in passing, that the new French foreign minister is <persName

                        by you and I strongly suspect that the fact that he got to know you somewhat
                        and had a serious conversation with you may have had a bit to do with his
                        recent selection to be the Foreign Minister.</p>

                        defense capability second to none.</p>
                    <p>“We’ve lost, in our foreign policy, the character of the American people.
                        We’ve ignored or excluded the American people and the Congress from
                        participation in the shaping of our foreign policy. It’s been one of secrecy

                        We’ve tried to buy success from our enemies, and at the same time we’ve

                        wanted, and we’ve been out-traded in almost every instance.</p>
                    <p>“The other point I want to make is about our defense. We’ve got to be a
                        nation blessed with the defense capability that’s efficient, tough, capable,
                        well organized, narrowly focused fighting capability. The <pb n="55"
                            facs="0096" xml:id="pg_55"/>ability to fight if necessary is the best
                        way to avoid the chance for or the requirement to fight.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_VVP_1">Valeriani</persName> returned to this theme
                        later in the debate, asking <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>
                        if he really believed that the United States was not the “most respected
                        country in world,” or if the statement was campaign rhetoric. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> answered:</p>
                    <p>“No, it’s not just campaign rhetoric. I think that militarily we are as
                        strong as any nation on Earth. I think we’ve got to stay that way and
                        continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat. But as
                        far as strength derived from commitment to principles; as far as strength
                        derived from the people, the Congress, the Secretary of State, the
                        President, sharing in the evolution and carrying out of a foreign policy; as
                        far as strength derived from the respect of our own allies and friends,
                        their assurance that we will be staunch in our commitment, that we will not
                        deviate, and we will give them adequate attention; as far as strength
                        derived from doing what is right, caring for the poor, providing food,
                        becoming the breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the
                        world—in those respects we are not strong. Also, we will never be strong
                        again overseas unless we are strong at home. And with our economy in such
                        terrible disarray, and getting worse by the month—we have got 500,000 more
                        Americans unemployed today than we had 3 months ago; we have got 2½ million
                        more Americans out of work now than we have when Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> took office—this kind of
                        deterioration in our economic strength is bound to weaken us in the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>“And we not only have problems at home but we export those problems overseas.
                        So, as far as the respect of our own people toward our own Government, as
                        far as participation in the shaping of concepts and commitments, as far as a
                        trust of our country among the nations of the world, as far as dependence of
                        our country in meeting the needs and obligations that we’ve expressed to our
                        allies, as far as the respect of our country, even among our potential
                        adversaries, we are weak. Potentially we are strong. Under this
                        administration that strength has not been realized.” (<hi rend="italic"

                    <p>During the 1976 Presidential campaign, Democratic candidate <persName

                            corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cyrus R. Vance</persName>, who had served as
                        Secretary of the <pb n="56" facs="0097" xml:id="pg_56"/>Army, Deputy
                        Secretary of Defense, Special Envoy on the Cyprus and Korean situations, and
                        negotiator at the Paris Peace Talks during the <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1"
                            >Lyndon B. Johnson</persName> administration, to serve as one of his
                        foreign policy advisers. After <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> made his offer, <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                            >Vance</persName> consulted with <persName corresp="#p_GRN_1">Richard

                        memoir of his tenure as <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>’s
                        Secretary of State: “He had a set of values that I found attractive. His
                        thinking reflected a principled approach to foreign affairs, which I
                        believed essential for the reestablishment of a broad base of domestic
                        support for a more comprehensive foreign policy. His views on specific
                        issues, although still largely unformed, were in the centrist mainstream in
                        which I felt comfortable. I concluded that this intense and energetic man
                        had a real chance to become the next president of the United States.” (<hi

                    <p>Upon further assessment and consultation, <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                            >Vance</persName> agreed to join <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName>’s foreign policy team. In the early fall of 1976,
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> wrote that <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> had requested him to prepare a
                        “memorandum setting out specific goals and priorities for a <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> foreign policy, should he be
                        elected.” (Ibid., pages 29–30) Under cover of an October 24, 1976,
                        memorandum to head of the <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName>
                        Policy Planning Group <persName corresp="#p_WJ_1">Jack Watson</persName>,
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> sent two copies of a
                        25-page “Overview of Foreign Policy Issues and Priorities” memorandum. On
                        the first page of the overview, <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                            >Vance</persName> noted that it “rapidly surveys, if not all the trees
                        in the foreign affairs forest, at least the clumps of trees.” He continued
                        with a broad statement of themes, which he felt should constitute the
                        primary elements of the <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>
                        administration’s foreign policy:</p>
                    <p>“(1) In its dealings with the Soviet Union, the United States will keep
                        itself strong, and will stand resolutely firm to protect key United States
                        interests. At the same time, the new Administration will continue to direct
                        its efforts toward the objective of a further reduction of tensions between
                        the two countries.</p>
                    <p>“—Although of central importance, <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>/Soviet
                        issues will not be permitted to so dominate our foreign policy that we
                        neglect other important relationships and problems.</p>
                    <p>“(2) The new Administration will bring a new sensitivity, awareness and
                        priority to the vast complex of issues clustering around the relationships
                        between the industrialized and the unindustrialized world, and the new set
                        of global issues that are emerging, such as energy, population, environment,
                        and nuclear proliferation.</p>
                    <p>“(3) The United States will continue in international forums its unwavering
                        stand in favor of the rights of free men and, without unrealistically
                        inserting itself into the internal operations of other governments, to give
                        important weight to those considerations in selecting foreign policy
                        positions in the interests of the United States.</p>
                    <pb n="57" facs="0098" xml:id="pg_57"/>
                    <p>“(4) In its conduct of its foreign policy, the new Administration will
                        proceed with gravity, not flurry; will not try to do everything at once or
                        solve all the world’s problems; and will keep its mind focused on long-term
                        general objectives, not just the crises of the moment.</p>
                    <p>“(5) The new Administration will accept the necessity to make the Congress
                        and the American people joint partners in foreign policy matters. To do so,
                        the President will assume major public leadership on foreign policy matters,
                        and make a major investment in educating the public to perceive the
                        difference between its long-term interests and its short-term interests, and
                        the difference between the interest of the nation as a whole and the
                        interests of particular subconstituencies and interest groups within the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>“These are pervasive general foreign policy themes. But a President will not
                        always have the luxury of setting his own agenda and his own timing.
                        Unforeseen crises will occur, demanding instant reaction. And the new
                        Administration will inherit several deep-seated, impacted sore spots (e.g.,
                        Mid-East, Korea, Greece-Turkey-Cyprus, Panama) that will require prompt
                        attention, as appears in later pages.” (Department of State, Office of the

                    <p>On November 30, <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> flew to Georgia
                        to meet with <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>. That evening,
                        they discussed many of the items outlined in the overview paper. At the
                        conclusion of the meeting, <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>
                        recalled that <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> asked him to
                        serve as Secretary of State. The next morning, <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                            >Vance</persName> shared with <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> his thinking about staffing the Department of State
                        before the discussion turned to other choices for cabinet positions. He
                        later reflected:</p>
                    <p>“In keeping with his declared intention to make greater use of the cabinet,
                        and to keep his personal staff out of the line between them and himself—a
                        sentiment I shared—<persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> chose his
                        cabinet officers before he named his White House team. He asked whether I
                        had any objection to <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Zbigniew
                            Brzezinski</persName>, who he had worked with at the Trilateral
                        Commission, as White House adviser for national security affairs. I said
                        that I did not know <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> well,
                        but I believed we could work together. I asked two conditions: first, that
                        it be made clear that I would be the <pb n="58" facs="0099" xml:id="pg_58"
                        />president’s spokesman on foreign policy; second, that I had no objection
                        to <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s offering <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> independent foreign policy
                        advice—in fact I encouraged the president to seek a variety of views—but
                        that I must be able to present to him my own unfiltered views before he made
                        any foreign policy decision. <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>
                        readily agreed, and we turned to other subjects, including other names for
                        cabinet posts.” (Ibid., page 34)</p>

                    <p>This memorandum contains our recommendations for action in ten key areas of
                        foreign policy and national security where we believe action should be taken
                        in the six months between election day and May 1, 1977. In each of these
                        areas, we have divided our recommendations into two parts—decisions you will
                        have to face (e.g., because of legislative requirements or already scheduled
                        international negotiations) and further decisions we recommend as being in
                        the national interest. In preparing this memorandum, we have drawn upon the
                        “option papers” supplied by Jack <persName corresp="#p_WJ_1"
                            >Watson</persName> as well as our own independent study and
                        analysis.</p>

                    <p rend="center">PART ONE: OVERALL CONCEPT</p>
                    <p>1. In the first three months after the Inaugural you will have the unique
                        opportunity—given the likelihood of broad popular and Congressional
                        support—to set U.S. policy on a new course. This will require:</p>
                    <p>(a) Public enunciation of your overall concept and direction.</p>
                    <p>(b) Adoption of specific actions on pressing issues.</p>
                    <p>(c) Seizing the initiative in several policy areas in order to foreshadow and
                        advance your overall strategy.</p>
                    <p>2. Four issues stand out as the most urgent of all:</p>
                    <p>(a) The need to put the East-West relationship on a more stable basis;</p>
                    <p>(b) The need to set in motion a process pointing toward a comprehensive
                        Middle Eastern settlement;</p>
                    <p>(c) The need to initiate comprehensive and constructive North-South
                        negotiations;</p>
                    <p>(d) The need to contain the arms race and to rationalize our defense
                        posture.</p>
                    <p>3. In your State of the Union Address<note n="2" xml:id="d13fn2">Presumable
                            reference to the inaugural address, as <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                                >Carter</persName> did not deliver a State of the Union address in
                            1977. For the inaugural address, see <ref target="#d15">Document
                                15</ref>.</note> you will have the opportunity to sketch out the
                        broad outlines of the foreign policy that you intend to follow. In that
                        Address you should explicitly reassert the traditional role of the President
                        as the formulator and articulator of U.S. foreign policy—making clear that
                        henceforth the United States will speak to the world through you. We
                        recommend the following themes:</p>
                    <p>A. The depth, extent, and pace of global change is ushering us into a new era
                        of either global cooperation or fragmentation.</p>
                    <p>B. The United States has no choice but to be engaged in a protracted
                        architectural process to reform and reshape the existing international
                        system. Unlike the years 1945–50, this calls not for assertive American
                        leadership but for more subtle inspiration and cooperation on a much wider
                        front. The new international system cannot be confined to the developed
                        countries but must involve increasingly the entire international community
                        of more than 150 nation-states. That community, in addition to the
                        traditional problems of war and peace, now confronts global problems never
                        before faced by mankind.</p>
                    <p>C. That in the above context you set the following priorities for the United
                        States:</p>
                    <pb n="60" facs="0101" xml:id="pg_60"/>
                    <p>i. To enhance and deepen our collaboration with our friends in the industrial
                        world—countries which share our values, have political systems similar to
                        ours, and which because of their wealth have a special burden of
                        responsibility to the rest of mankind.</p>
                    <p>ii. This cooperation should focus not only on improving prospects in the
                        industrial world but on making it more possible for the new emerging states
                        to enhance, through self-reliance, their own internal progress.</p>
                    <p>iii. In the foregoing context, we shall seek cooperation on the global
                        problems with the communist countries, while striving to reduce areas of
                        conflict and to codify more precise rules of reciprocal restraint—notably
                        through strategic arms limitations and reductions and through agreements on
                        regional restraints.</p>
                    <p>This speech would initiate a new phase in U.S. foreign policy, going beyond
                        the Atlanticist/East-West Cold War framework of the years 1945–1976. The
                        regional and functional recommendations that follow are designed to set such
                        a foreign policy in motion.</p>

                    <p>Secretary of State-designate <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cyrus R.
                            Vance</persName> testified on January 11, 1977, before the Senate
                        Foreign Relations Committee, which was holding an open hearing in order to
                        consider <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>’s nomination. The
                        previous afternoon, <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> had
                        attended a closed, “get-acquainted” informal meeting with Committee members.
                        Senator <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">John Sparkman</persName> (D-Alabama)
                        chaired the January 11 hearing and began the proceedings by summarizing
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>’s professional career. He
                        then called on Senators <persName corresp="#p_JJK_1">Jacob Javits</persName>
                        (R-New York) and <persName corresp="#p_MDP_1">Daniel Patrick
                            Moynihan</persName> (D-New York) to offer statements in support of the
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> nomination. Following
                        their statements, <persName corresp="#p_SJJ_1">Sparkman</persName> directed
                        Senator <persName corresp="#p_CFF_1">Frank Church</persName> (D-Idaho) to
                        question <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CFF_1">Church</persName> stated:</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>, we have just come through
                        an election campaign in which there was a lively debate on foreign policy
                        matters. I think as a result of the election there is the expectation that
                        the new President will be initiating changes in American foreign policy.</p>
                    <pb n="61" facs="0102" xml:id="pg_61"/>
                    <p>“I wonder if you might headline for the committee what you think some of
                        those changes may be, and what your own view may be respecting that.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> responded:</p>
                    <p>“Thank you very much, Senator <persName corresp="#p_CFF_1">Church</persName>.
                        I would be very happy to do that.</p>
                    <p>“First, let me start by briefly sketching what I would consider to be the
                        fundamental policy principles which one could expect to guide the
                        development of foreign policy during the next administration.</p>
                    <p>“Let me say that in doing this I run the risk of vastly oversimplifying the
                        problem. But with that caveat at the outset, let me try.</p>
                    <p>“The first principle is the maintenance of peace. This depends upon healthy
                        alliances, American strength, creative efforts to facilitate the resolution
                        of regional disputes, as, for example, the problems of the Middle East. In
                        this connection I think we must remember that American strength and
                        leadership abroad proceed first from a strong America at home—strong in our
                        economy, strong in our cohesiveness, strong in our confidence and our
                        commitment to fundamental values.</p>
                    <p>“The second principle is a public confidence in our foreign policy requires
                        confidence in how those policies are made. This, in my judgment, has at the
                        heart of it a close and cooperative relationship between the executive
                        branch and the legislative branch. I do not believe that we can develop or
                        properly implement American foreign policy without the closest cooperation
                        between these two branches of the Government.</p>
                    <p>“I pledge myself and this administration to this end.</p>
                    <p>“Next, I believe that we must have openness, and toward that end all that can
                        properly be disclosed in open sessions should be disclosed in open sessions.
                        There will obviously be times when things cannot be, but the guiding
                        principle will be that we will try and be as much open as possible. I know
                        that the President-elect intends to communicate openly with the American
                        people through the process of fireside chats in discussing foreign policy as
                        well as domestic policy.</p>
                    <p>“I intend to meet once a month with the press, if not more often because of
                        special circumstances, and hold a press conference to discuss with them
                        whatever questions they may have.</p>
                    <p>“The third principle is the need for clear, easily understood, substantive
                        priorities that will contribute to building the world that we want to live
                        in. I have four particularly in mind.</p>
                    <p>“First is a strengthening of cooperation among our allies. This is central to
                        everything else.</p>
                    <p>“Second, East-West relations are critical because they affect the question of
                        world peace. In my judgment we should pursue the lessening of tensions with
                        the Soviet Union in an active and aggressive <pb n="62" facs="0103"
                            xml:id="pg_62"/>way, particularly in the area of the reduction and
                        control of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>“Further, I believe that we should seek a clearer understanding between the
                        U.S. and the Soviet Union on the meaning of détente so that we understand
                        better how each of us perceives the process to operate. I think this is
                        possible and can be done. In saying this, I do not believe that we will not
                        continue to have political competition. I think indeed that we will have
                        political competition with the Soviet Union. But I do think it is important
                        to have a better understanding of what the ground rules are and what we can
                        expect of each other.</p>
                    <p>“Let me note that I do not think that the preoccupation with these vitally
                        important issues should so dominate our foreign policy that we neglect other
                        critical issues which are growing increasingly important.</p>
                    <p>“Let me turn to them.</p>
                    <p>“These I consider to be of cardinal importance: I believe we must keep our
                        eyes fixed on long-term objectives as well as on immediate political crises.
                        These long-term objectives include control of nuclear arms and nuclear
                        proliferation, economic development and the dignity of the developing world,
                        energy, food, population, environment, and conventional arms transfers.</p>
                    <p>“These are the global issues which will determine how the next generation
                        lives, and even whether it lives.</p>
                    <p>“I note, as all of you know better than I, that foreign policy is
                        increasingly intertwined with economic policy. These sets of intertwined
                        issues in my judgment are going to be some of the most important and complex
                        issues with which we will be dealing in the years ahead. Indeed, I believe
                        as we look over the next 5 to 10 years, we may find that these issues will
                        be replacing many of the security issues which have so dominated the foreign
                        policy agenda in the last 10 to 20 years as the most important issues with
                        which we have to deal.</p>
                    <p>“Finally, we must have policies based upon fundamental values. In particular,
                        we must stand for human rights. Without being interventionist I believe we
                        can make this concern a major focus of our foreign policy calculations.</p>
                    <p>“I apologize for the condensation of these many and complex problems. But
                        perhaps this will serve as a basis from which to start our discussion.”</p>
                    <p>After Senator <persName corresp="#p_CCP_1">Clifford Case</persName> (R-New

                            >Vance</persName>’s point concerning a U.S. foreign policy based on
                        fundamental values:</p>
                    <p>“This came up time and time again during the foreign policy debates during
                        the recent national campaign. I for one am very happy that you have listed
                        this as a point of departure for your own policy be<pb n="63" facs="0104"
                            xml:id="pg_63"/>cause I think that our foreign policy should reflect our
                        values as a country. If we are going to mean anything to the world, we have
                        to be true to ourselves.</p>
                    <p>“I would hope that this will translate into some refusal on the part of the
                        administration to continue to extend military and economic aid to regimes
                        that are systematically engaged in the repression of human rights, at least
                        in the absence of overriding considerations of national security that might
                        require us to adopt a different policy. Do I understand that by placing
                        greater emphasis upon these fundamental values we can expect that your
                        administration of the State Department will take into greater account the
                        kinds of governments we are supplying aid to in the future?</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>. Yes; you can.</p>
                    <p>“Matters of human rights will be given a greater emphasis with respect to
                        those decisions. But I think it is important to make the point that you did;
                        namely, that there are cases in which the security aspects are of overriding
                        importance and that that has to be borne in mind.</p>
                    <p>“Senator <persName corresp="#p_CFF_1">Church</persName>. Of course.</p>
                    <p>“I can think of many countries to which we have given large amounts of aid
                        under previous administrations that have had little or no impact upon the
                        national security of the United States. I am encouraged by your statement
                        that more attention will be given in the future to the nature and the
                        character of the governments which we support with our aid programs.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CFF_1">Church</persName> then directed the questioning
                        to a discussion of covert operations:</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>, the other side of the
                        coin in the matter of human rights and fundamental values has to do with the
                        methods that we use. Everyone knows today that under both Democratic and
                        Republican Presidents in our recent past we have intervened through covert
                        operations in many countries with a will, indeed with a zeal. Now these
                        covert operations were unconnected with the gathering of central
                        intelligence information, but were secret undertakings in foreign lands to
                        manipulate political events in ways thought to be advantageous to the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>“Our methods were justified on the grounds that we must use them because the
                        Russians do. They have embraced all of the black arts of covert
                        operations—bribery, false propaganda, physical coercion, abduction, indeed
                        even attempted assassination of foreign leaders.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t know how we can be true to our own values as a country and continue
                        to believe that it is our right to use such methods; though again, I
                        recognize that in extremity a nation must do what is needed to assure its
                        own survival. But we are not discussing cases of extremity, <pb n="64"
                            facs="0105" xml:id="pg_64"/>and the habit of the past has been to
                        intervene in these ways in the affairs of other lands, even when the
                        objective was purely technical.</p>
                    <p>“Now I would like your own view on this. If method is the essence of whether
                        or not we do adhere to our professed values as a nation, what are your views
                        and what will be your policy as Secretary of State when it comes to
                        decisions with respect to secret interventions in the affairs of other
                        lands?</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>. I am very happy to give
                        my views on this.</p>
                    <p>“Let me say by way of background that these kinds of covert actions have been
                        going on for a long time. They were going on when I was in the Government,
                        and I was part of the oversight committee at one point in connection with
                        them. So I have thought long and carefully about the subject.</p>
                    <p>“I have come to the conclusion that covert actions—and I distinguish between
                        covert collection of intelligence on the one part and covert actions against
                        other countries, and I am talking about the latter—I am convinced that
                        covert action against other countries should be carried out only in the most
                        extraordinary circumstances. I believe that procedures should be established
                        so that if there is a proposal to carry out a covert action, that it first
                        has to be passed upon by a committee of the senior Cabinet officers, to
                        include the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the National
                        Security Adviser, and importantly in my judgment, the Attorney General of
                        the United States.</p>
                    <p>“I feel very strongly that the Attorney General of the United States should
                        participate in the decisionmaking process by which the decision is arrived
                        at which goes to the President of the United States. I think then that the
                        President of the United States should personally approve in writing saying
                        that he believes this to be vital to the national security and so endorse
                        the carrying forward of this extraordinary circumstance.</p>
                    <p>“I then feel that notice should be given in advance to the appropriate
                        committee or committees of the Congress so that they can provide their views
                        to the President if they disagree with the proposal.</p>
                    <p>“I do not believe that the Congress should have a veto in that regard because
                        I think that splits the responsibility. But I think that it is very likely
                        that if the congressional committee said to the President, ’We want to come
                        in to see you as we have great concern for what is being proposed here,’
                        this would have great weight with any President as to whether he would then
                        go forward with the operation.</p>
                    <p>“Finally, I believe there should be an adequate monitoring system so that
                        once a covert action is approved, one keeps on top of it to determine what
                        is happening, how it is proceeding, and whether it should be terminated.</p>

                    <p>“Unfortunately, experience in the past has shown that these develop a life of
                        their own. Once started they are hard to turn back.” (<hi rend="italic">

                        the connections among strength, freedom, and responsibility in his inaugural
                        address, delivered on January 20, 1977:</p>
                    <p>“Our Nation can be strong abroad only if it is strong at home. And we know
                        that the best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here
                        that our democratic system is worthy of emulation.</p>
                    <p>“To be true to ourselves, we must be true to others. We will not behave in
                        foreign places so as to violate our rules and standards here at home, for we
                        know that the trust which our Nation earns is essential to our strength.</p>
                    <p>“The world itself is now dominated by a new spirit. Peoples more numerous and
                        more politically aware are craving, and now demanding, their place in the
                        sun—not just for the benefit of their own physical condition, but for basic
                        human rights.</p>
                    <p>“The passion for freedom is on the rise. Tapping this new spirit, there can
                        be no nobler nor more ambitious task for America to undertake on this day of
                        a new beginning than to help shape a just and peaceful world that is truly
                        humane.</p>
                    <p>“We are a strong nation, and we will maintain strength so sufficient that it
                        need not be proven in combat—a quiet strength based not merely on the size
                        of an arsenal but on the nobility of ideas.</p>
                    <p>“We will be ever vigilant and never vulnerable, and we will fight our wars
                        against poverty, ignorance, and injustice, for those are the enemies against
                        which our forces can be honorably marshaled.</p>
                    <p>“We are a proudly idealistic nation, but let no one confuse our idealism with
                        weakness.</p>
                    <pb n="66" facs="0107" xml:id="pg_66"/>
                    <p>“Because we are free, we can never be indifferent to the fate of freedom
                        elsewhere. Our moral sense dictates a clear-cut preference for those
                        societies which share with us an abiding respect for individual human
                        rights. We do not seek to intimidate, but it is clear that a world which
                        others can dominate with impunity would be inhospitable to decency and a
                        threat to the well-being of all people.</p>
                    <p>“The world is still engaged in a massive armaments race designed to ensure
                        continuing equivalent strength among potential adversaries. We pledge
                        perseverance and wisdom in our efforts to limit the world’s armaments to
                        those necessary for each nation’s domestic safety. And we will move this
                        year a step toward our ultimate goal—the elimination of all nuclear weapons
                        from this Earth. We urge all other people to join us, for success can mean
                        life instead of death.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName

                        from the East Front of the Capitol. Immediately before the address Chief

                        characterized the speech:</p>
                    <p>“I think the inauguration speech itself, perhaps one of the briefest on
                        record for the first inauguration of a president, was quite compatible with
                        my announcement speech in December 1974, and also with my acceptance speech
                        at the Democratic convention. It accurately expressed some of the major
                        themes of my administration.” (<persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"

                    <p>In a separate videotaped address to global audiences, the President
                        reinforced the themes of the inaugural address:</p>
                    <p>“I have chosen the occasion of my inauguration as President to speak not only
                        to my own countrymen—which is traditional—but also to you, citizens of the
                        world who did not participate in our election but who will nevertheless be
                        affected by my decisions.</p>
                    <p>“I also believe that as friends you are entitled to know how the power and
                        influence of the United States will be exercised by its new Government.</p>
                    <p>“I want to assure you that the relations of the United States with the other
                        countries and peoples of the world will be guided during my own
                        administration by our desire to shape a world order that is more responsive
                        to human aspirations. The United States will meet its obligation to help
                        create a stable, just, and peaceful world order.</p>
                    <p>“We will not seek to dominate nor dictate to others. As we Americans have
                        concluded one chapter in our Nation’s history and are beginning to work on
                        another, we have, I believe, acquired a more mature perspective on the
                        problems of the world. It is a perspective which rec<pb n="67" facs="0108"
                            xml:id="pg_67"/>ognizes the fact that we alone do not have all the
                        answers to the world’s problems.</p>
                    <p>“The United States alone cannot lift from the world the terrifying specter of
                        nuclear destruction. We can and will work with others to do so.</p>
                    <p>“The United States alone cannot guarantee the basic right of every human
                        being to be free of poverty and hunger and disease and political repression.
                        We can and will cooperate with others in combating these enemies of
                        mankind.</p>
                    <p>“The United States alone cannot ensure an equitable development of the world
                        resources or the proper safeguarding of the world’s environment. But we can
                        and will join with others in this work.</p>
                    <p>“The United States can and will take the lead in such efforts.</p>
                    <p>“In these endeavors we need your help, and we offer ours. We need your
                        experience; we need your wisdom.</p>
                    <p>“We need your active participation in a joint effort to move the reality of
                        the world closer to the ideals of human freedom and dignity.</p>
                    <p>“As friends, you can depend on the United States to be in the forefront of
                        the search for world peace. You can depend on the United States to remain
                        steadfast in its commitment to human freedom and liberty. And you can also
                        depend on the United States to be sensitive to your own concerns and
                        aspirations, to welcome your advice, to do its utmost to resolve
                        international differences in a spirit of cooperation.</p>
                    <p>“The problems of the world will not be easily resolved. Yet the well-being of
                        each and every one of us—indeed our mutual survival—depends on their
                        resolution. As President of the United States I can assure you that we
                        intend to do our part. I ask you to join us in a common effort based on
                        mutual trust and mutual respect.</p>

                    <p>In behalf of President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>, I
                        have come today to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Headquarters as a
                        matter of the first priority. I have come to convey to you and the member
                        governments of the North Atlantic alliance:</p>
                    <p>—The President’s most sincere greetings;</p>
                    <p>—His commitment, and the full commitment of the United States, to the North
                        Atlantic alliance as a vital part of our deep and enduring relations with
                        Canada and Western Europe; and</p>
                    <p>—His dedication to improving cooperation and consultations with our oldest
                        friends so as to safeguard our peoples and to promote our common efforts and
                        concerns.</p>
                    <p>The President’s conviction concerning <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                        >NATO</gloss>’s central role is deep rooted and firm. As he stated in his
                        message to the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Ministers last
                            month:<note n="2" xml:id="d16fn2">For text, see <hi rend="italic"
                                >Bulletin</hi> of Jan. 3, 1977, p. 9. [Footnote in the original.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> delivered a
                            message from President-elect <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                                >Carter</persName> in the ministerial meeting of the North Atlantic
                            Council in Brussels on December 9, 1976. <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                                >Carter</persName> asserted: “I am convinced that <gloss

                            alliance are no less important today than when <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                                >NATO</gloss> was originally established. I look forward to working
                            closely with all the governments represented at this meeting.”]</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> alliance lies at the heart of the
                        partnership between North America and Western Europe. <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> is the essential instrument for
                        enhancing our collective security. The American commitment to maintaining
                        the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> alliance shall be sustained and
                        strengthened under my Administration.</p>
                    <pb n="69" facs="0110" xml:id="pg_69"/>
                    <p>This statement of renewed American commitment comes at a time of great
                        promise in our country. We are a young Administration—some 90 hours old. We
                        have come to office following a long period of difficulty in the United
                        States, and of doubt among friends about our will and steadfastness. But
                        this has also been a time of promising change in America, just as in Europe
                        and elsewhere in the world. As President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> said in his inaugural address, “The world itself now
                        is dominated by a new spirit.”<note n="3" xml:id="d16fn3">See <ref
                                target="#d15">Document 15</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I share his belief that in the United States “there is evident a serious and
                        purposeful rekindling of confidence.” There is a new understanding of our
                        society and appreciation of our recognized limits. But there is also a new
                        faith in the strength of our democratic system of government, a new
                        willingness to meet challenges and continuing responsibilities abroad. Some
                        of these challenges are unfamiliar to us all—as the wind of change has
                        transformed so much of the world. We are ready to play our role in meeting
                        these challenges. But we believe the requirement for leadership and
                        creativity also falls upon our friends and allies in Europe, Japan, and
                        elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>I share the confidence of President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> that, together, we will be equal to the tasks of the
                        future as we have met those in the past. To this end, the United States is
                        wholeheartedly dedicated:</p>
                    <p>—To the security, prosperity, and well-being of our people and of our
                        allies;</p>
                    <p>—To “eternal vigilance” in preserving peace; and</p>
                    <p>—To promoting human values and human dignity for people everywhere.</p>
                    <p>In cooperation with our friends abroad, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> is proceeding immediately with
                        steps to strengthen the American economy. He is proceeding with steps which
                        will enable the United States to help meet the extraordinary energy
                        challenge facing all our countries. He is giving priority attention to the
                        agenda of vital economic and political issues before the industrialized
                        nations of the West—in Europe, North America, and Japan. And President
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> is deeply conscious of
                        the aspirations of people in the world’s developing nations and of the need
                        for all of us to seek new and cooperative relations with these
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> takes office at a
                        time when we have moved from the rigid period of the cold war into a period
                        of expanded contact and greater potential for accommodation—for mutual
                        benefit—with potential adversaries in particular but still limited areas. It
                        is now possible to talk, where before it was only possible to confront one
                        another in deadly and undiminished hostility. And it is imperative that we
                            con<pb n="70" facs="0111" xml:id="pg_70"/>tinue this dialogue, ever
                        seeking to expand its depth and compass, yet fully consistent with Western
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, the President and his Administration are vitally aware of
                        the continuing growth in Soviet military power and the uncertainties that
                        lie ahead with inevitable changes in Soviet leadership in the years to come.
                        The growth of Soviet military power makes us keenly aware of the need for
                        the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> alliance to modernize and improve
                        its defenses—not for the sake of military power itself but, rather, for a
                        more fundamental reason. This reason is stated in the North Atlantic Treaty:
                        that we are determined to safeguard the freedom, the common heritage, and
                        the civilization of our peoples, founded on the principles of democracy,
                        individual liberty, justice, and the rule of law.</p>
                    <p>As President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> said in his
                        inaugural address about our own country:</p>
                    <p>We are a strong nation, and we will maintain strength so sufficient that it
                        need not be proven in combat—a quiet strength based not merely on the size
                        of an arsenal but on the nobility of ideas.</p>
                    <p>The Atlantic alliance has successfully withstood repeated testing for more
                        than a quarter century. And as President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> begins his Administration, we mark another milestone
                        in U.S.-European relations—the 30th anniversary of the Marshall plan. Today,
                        as we look back on how much we have done together, it is fitting to recall
                        what Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_MGC_1">Marshall</persName>
                        said at Harvard in June 1947:</p>
                    <p>Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine but against
                        hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos. Its purpose should be the revival
                        of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political
                        and social conditions in which free institutions can exist.<note n="4"

                    <p>And this concern with basic values still motivates us today.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Secretary General, members of the Council, 30 years ago the United States
                        entered into a firm commitment to enduring involvement on this continent—as
                        vital to both the United States and Europe and as reflecting shared
                        political and human values. President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> has asked me personally to convey to you that the
                        American commitment remains firm and undiminished.</p>
                    <p>In support of our close ties with our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        allies—our commitment to allied defense—President <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> is determined to maintain fully
                        effective defense forces in Europe. As you are well aware, we are determined
                        to reduce waste and inefficiency in the U.S. defense budget. But he has
                        asked me to inform you that his new budget and <pb n="71" facs="0112"
                            xml:id="pg_71"/>these efficiencies will not result in any decrease in

                        these plans involve some growth.</p>
                    <p>Before I left Washington, President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> emphasized to me his deep concern about <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s defense. He told me that he is
                        prepared to consider increased U.S. investment in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss>’s defense. In turn, we look to America’s allies to join
                        with us in improving <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s defense forces
                        to the limit of individual abilities, to provide a defense fully adequate to
                        our needs. Of course, economic and social problems make a strong claim on
                        our resources—no less so in the United States than in Europe. And in a time
                        of détente, it is easy to lose sight of the need for adequate defense. But
                        this need is inescapable. It demands continuing efforts in common.</p>
                    <p>The alliance as a whole must take into account the growth in Soviet military
                        power and together agree on the appropriate response. In improving our
                        defense forces, we must redouble our efforts to standardize weapons,
                        rationalize our military posture, increase efficiency, and improve
                        reinforcement capability. We must place greater emphasis on improved force
                        readiness. And as an alliance, we cannot accept reductions in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> defense capabilities except through
                        negotiations with the Warsaw Pact—negotiations fully securing allied
                        interests and leading to a more stable military balance.</p>
                    <p>Negotiations on force levels in Europe—<gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss>
                        [mutual and balanced force reductions]—must move forward with the closest
                        attention paid to the interests of each member state and as a clear
                        expression of common and agreed positions.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> is
                        committed to an early resumption of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks,
                        looking toward another step this year in the effort to end the strategic
                        arms race with the Soviet Union. He has publicly stated that three basic
                        principles will guide him in this effort:</p>
                    <p>—He will pursue arms control agreements in the best interests of the United
                        States, the alliance, and world peace;</p>
                    <p>—He will insist on no less than equivalent advantage for the West in any
                        agreement; and</p>
                    <p>—He will strengthen consultations and cooperation with America’s natural
                        friends and allies throughout the negotiating process.</p>
                    <p>The President has asked me today to affirm again his intention to consult
                        closely with our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies before the
                        Strategic Arms Limitation Talks are resumed. He also looks forward to
                        working in closest cooperation with you on <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1"
                            >MBFR</gloss>. And while the new Administration is undertaking a careful
                        review of these negotiations, we anticipate no early change in U.S.
                        proposals to our allies concerning the allied position at the force
                        reduction talks.</p>

                    <p>At the same time the President has asked me to express to you his desire for
                        closest possible consultations on the implementation of the Final Act of the
                        Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe—and on looking to the
                            future.<note n="5" xml:id="d16fn5">See <ref target="#d4fn7">footnote 7,

                        unity and on the success of our efforts to work together—both in <gloss

                        Belgrade. As President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> said
                        in his inaugural address: “Because we are free we can never be indifferent
                        to the fate of freedom elsewhere.”</p>
                    <p>The issues that I have discussed so far relate directly to our security in
                        the immediate area covered by the alliance and to the future of our
                        cooperative relations together. Yet while the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> alliance provides each of our nations with the blessings
                        of peace and security in the North Atlantic, tension and conflict in some
                        other parts of the world involving economic and political as well as
                        military issues can adversely affect our common security.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> and Secretary of
                        State <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> are turning early
                        attention to other areas of vital concern: in the Middle East, in southern
                        Africa, in Cyprus, and regarding both the sale of conventional arms and
                        efforts to halt the spread of nuclear weapons. On these issues, the
                        President looks forward to working closely with our friends and allies in
                        Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Secretary General, members of the council, we do not live in easy times.
                        But they are hopeful times, as well. This is a period of historic
                        opportunity. All Americans look to the future confident in the belief
                        that—with vision, hard work, and firm unity of purpose—our association of
                        free peoples will continue to provide the security and cooperation vital to
                        us all.</p>
                    <p>This association goes beyond <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> itself.
                        For the strength and vitality of the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        alliance is only one task facing all of us. As we seek to promote and
                        strengthen our security in the broadest sense, we must also use effectively
                        those other forums we have to resolve the great economic and other issues
                        facing our nations and peoples. And we must <pb n="73" facs="0114"
                            xml:id="pg_73"/>work with those countries facing economic difficulty and
                        support nations in Europe seeking to rebuild or strengthen democratic
                        institutions.</p>
                    <p>Together, we share many strengths. Ours is an alliance of democratic
                        governments, of economies which have provided an unprecedented abundance, of
                        energetic and imaginative peoples. Our countries are part of a great
                        civilization of high moral purpose, deep human values, and a shared
                        commitment to justice and compassion. Our societies are resilient and
                        flexible, and thanks to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, we have a
                        strong common defense.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> and his
                        Administration are dedicated not only to preserving these strengths and
                        virtues but also to building on them in the years ahead. This is his basic
                        message to you and to your countries. I hope my visit here will also enable
                        me to convey to the President your thoughts and your concerns. For these
                        will be of great value to us in Washington as we shape our own policies and
                        programs. I look forward to hearing your comments.</p>
                    <p>Years ago, Jean Monnet, the father of Europe, spoke eloquently on the problem
                        facing us: “Europe and America,” he said, “must acknowledge that neither of
                        us is defending a particular country, that we are all defending our common
                        civilization.” We have acknowledged that basic truth, and it will bind us
                        ever closer together in the years to come.</p>

                            corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>.</p>
                    <p>I have read your public remarks with great interest, and they encourage me to
                        believe that we share a common desire to enhance and preserve the prospect
                        of lasting peace.</p>
                    <p>As I understood your very important speech at Tula,<note n="3"

                        arms, will oppose the concept, and will require only a defense sufficient to
                        deter any potential adversary. The United States seeks nothing more or less
                        for itself. With perseverance and wisdom therefore our two countries should
                        be in a position to avoid a new armaments race. I have said to the American
                        people that my firm goal is to eliminate all nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>There are three areas where progress can be made toward this goal. A critical
                        first step should be the achievement of a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> II agreement without delay,<note n="4" xml:id="d17fn4">The
                                <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II negotiations, which began

                        limitations and reductions in strategic weapons. Moreover, I hope we can
                        promptly conclude an adequately verified comprehensive ban on all nuclear
                        tests, and also strive to achieve greater openness about our respective
                        strategic policies. It is also important to renew efforts for progress in
                        the negotiations for a balanced reduction of forces in Central Europe.</p>
                    <p>We also have a responsibility to pursue policies that will prevent the
                        troubled areas of the world from exploding into dangerous conflicts. The
                        United States will work to promote a peaceful settlement in the Middle East
                        on the basis of appropriate <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolutions.
                        Similarly in Southern Africa we are encouraging all parties to negotiate a
                        peaceful settlement which promotes security and justice for all.</p>
                    <p>It is my belief that the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> can
                        contribute to the realization of progress toward peace in both of these
                        critical areas.</p>
                    <p>My Administration attaches importance to the improvement of our bilateral
                        economic relations, on the basis of mutual and equivalent benefits to the
                        peoples of both our great countries. At the same time we cannot be
                        indifferent to the fate of freedom and individual human rights.</p>
                    <p>We represent different social systems and our nations are different in
                        background and experience. Competition over ideals and ideas is inevitable
                        between our societies. But it need not prevent a common effort to shape a
                        world that is more peaceful, just and humane. We live in a <pb n="75"
                            facs="0116" xml:id="pg_75"/>world that increasingly requires collective
                        responses to basic human problems, and my hope is that our countries can
                        cooperate more closely in order to promote development, better nutrition,
                        and a more meaningful life for the less fortunate portions of mankind.</p>
                    <p>I look forward to meeting you and to discussing with you both our differences
                        as well as our common interests. Meanwhile I propose that we both do all
                        that we can to further the progress of improving <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss>-Soviet relations. I have asked Secretary <persName

                        wish, in the spring to review the progress being made, to discuss key issues
                        which are outstanding. At that time we will want to exchange views on a
                        subsequent meeting between you and me.</p>
                    <p>Any specific suggestions you may wish to communicate to me on these or any

                    <p>On January 27, 1977, the Department of State issued a statement, in response
                        to a question posed at a January 26 news briefing, concerning the Soviet
                        Union’s treatment of Nobel Prize winning scientist <persName
                            corresp="#p_SAD_1">Andrey Sakharov</persName>. The statement warned that
                        any “attempts by Soviet authorities to intimidate Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SAD_1">Sakharov</persName> will not silence legitimate
                        criticism in the Soviet Union and will conflict with accepted international
                        standards in the field of human rights.” (Department of State <hi

                    <p>During a January 31 news conference held at the Department of State,
                        Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cyrus Vance</persName>
                        discussed the <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>
                        administration’s response to human rights concerns, specifically <persName
                            corresp="#p_SAD_1">Sakharov</persName>’s case:</p>
                    <p>“Q. <persName corresp="#p_AJ_1">Jim Anderson</persName>, <gloss
                            target="#t_UPI_1">UPI</gloss>. Mr. Secretary, on the question of
                        international civil rights, is this Administration going to continue the
                        practice of speaking out on cases such as the <persName corresp="#p_SAD_1"
                            >Sakharov</persName> episode? Or are you going to continue the practice
                        of your predecessor, exerting quiet diplomatic pressure and using his
                        concept of linkage?</p>
                    <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>: On the issue of
                        human rights, the President has often expressed his deep concern in this
                        area and has reaffirmed that deep concern in the inauguration address.</p>
                    <pb n="76" facs="0117" xml:id="pg_76"/>
                    <p>“We will speak frankly about injustice both at home and abroad. We do not
                        intend, however, to be strident or polemical, but we do believe that an
                        abiding respect for human rights is a human value of fundamental importance
                        and that it must be nourished. We will not comment on each and every issue,
                        but we will from time to time comment when we see a threat to human rights,
                        when we believe it constructive to do so.</p>
                    <p>“Q. Mr. Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_SB_2">Barry Schweid</persName> of
                            <gloss target="#t_AP_1">AP</gloss>. On the same subject, one of the
                        local pundits yesterday called it sudden diplomacy, suggesting that this
                        speaking out hasn’t been very well thought out, particularly its impact on
                        diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>“You refer to your trip to Moscow. Do you think the statement you have made
                        on <persName corresp="#p_SAD_1">Sakharov</persName> and your general view on
                        human rights will have an impact, a negative impact, on negotiations with
                        the Soviet Union? Indeed, isn’t that what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1"
                            >Dobrynin</persName> [<persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Anatoliy F.
                            Dobrynin</persName>, Soviet Ambassador to the U.S.] called to tell you
                        the other day?</p>
                    <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>: I do not believe
                        that it will have a negative impact. As I indicated, we will from time to
                        time speak out. I have discussed the matter with Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName>, but I am sure that our
                        discussions with the Soviet Union on a whole range of matters will not be
                        adversely affected by what we have said.”</p>
                    <p>After discussion of several issues, <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                            >Vance</persName> again responded to questions relating to human rights
                        violations:</p>
                    <p>“Q. <persName corresp="#p_KM_1">Marvin Kalb</persName>, <gloss
                            target="#t_CBS_1">CBS</gloss>. The President said yesterday that perhaps
                        the statement about <persName corresp="#p_SAD_1">Sakharov</persName> should
                        have been made by him or by you. Yet the day before the State Department
                        made its statement on <persName corresp="#p_SAD_1">Sakharov</persName>, it
                        did come out with a statement on Czechoslovakia, which apparently had been
                        cleared. Are you not running the danger, sir, of setting up what amounts to
                        a double standard of the manner in which you respond to violations of human
                        rights in the Soviet Union and in smaller countries where there is not a
                        direct, vital interest conflict?</p>
                    <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>: This is a very
                        complex area. As I indicated, we will not be speaking out in every case. We
                        will speak out when we believe it advisable to do so, but that will not be,
                        as I said, in each and every case. It is an area where, as I said, I think
                        we have an obligation to make our views frankly known; but we hope we can do
                        it without being strident, as I said, or intrusive in an improper way.</p>
                    <p>“Q. Isn’t that really setting up a kind of double standard where the
                        Department, or the Administration, might feel itself more free in condemning
                        human rights in smaller countries where there is not a vital interest
                        affected?</p>
                    <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>: No. I hope we will
                        not have a double standard. I think what we have done so far would indicate
                        we have not.</p>
                    <pb n="77" facs="0118" xml:id="pg_77"/>
                    <p>“Q. <persName corresp="#p_KJ_2">Jim Klurfeld</persName> from Newsday. On this
                        same situation, there were reports that you were unhappy with the statement
                        made on the <persName corresp="#p_SAD_1">Sakharov</persName> situation. I
                        just wonder if you can tell us who did clear that statement. I think the
                        President indicated yesterday he did not clear it. Who did clear it? And
                        whether you feel that this is an instance in which you should not have
                        spoken out.</p>
                    <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>: Let me say I did
                        not see it; it was cleared at lower levels. I am not going to give the name
                        of the individual. I have the responsibility in this Department, and
                        therefore I accept that responsibility fully. Let me say that I respect Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_SAD_1">Sakharov</persName> very deeply; I respect
                        his, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SAD_1">Sakharov</persName>’s, principles and
                        his pursuit of those principles.</p>
                    <p>“Q. Your predecessor frequently said in speeches that not only is it
                        inadvisable but rather it is counterproductive to speak out, specifically in
                        the case of Soviet emigration—or emigration from the Soviet Union by
                        minorities, including Jews, which dropped sharply after the United States
                        tried to exert pressure. Do you subscribe to that theory, particularly, that
                        speaking out is actually counterproductive?</p>
                    <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>: No, I do not share
                        that view.</p>
                    <p>“Q. If you don’t share that view, could you say what your view is on that
                        specific aspect of the problem?</p>
                    <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>: My view is that at
                        times we will feel it appropriate and necessary to speak out and there will
                        be other times when we will not.” (Ibid., pages 137–138, 140–141; brackets
                        in the original)</p>

                        summarized the major themes of the press conference:</p>
                    <p>“You may already have seen the first press reports on my press conference
                        this morning so I will not review in detail with you what transpired. The
                        questions asked were along predictable lines, although I was struck by the
                        degree of interest, even sharpness, on human rights issues. Since we have
                        announced that this administration will speak out on selected international
                        human rights issues, we will of course be asked continually why we are
                        commenting on some and not on others. I am confident, however, that we have
                        a credible rationale for making public statements on human rights questions
                        and that the country expects your administration to pay more attention to
                        such issues in the foreign affairs field. We have chosen <persName
                            corresp="#p_DPM_1">Pat Derian</persName> to be the State Department
                        Human Rights Coordinator which will give us a well qualified and sensitive
                        person to follow human rights issues worldwide.” (Carter Library, Plains

                    <p>The PRESIDENT opened the meeting by saying he needed the advice of the
                        Congressmen, and “I want to work closely with you.” Over the past few months
                        the President said he has been an active student of foreign policy and he
                        wants to conduct “an aggressive foreign policy.” The President noted the
                        unique quality of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> who
                        did a lot of things on his own. However, the President said his
                        administration will have a different “team” style. He mentioned Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>, Vice President <persName
                            corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName>, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                            >Brzezinski</persName> and others as team members. The President told

                        Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName> at first felt it
                        was a token visit, but after spending four hours with his Cabinet and the
                            <persName corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName> mission, <persName
                            corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName> was impressed with the substance of
                        the discussions.</p>
                    <p>“I’ve enjoyed being President so far, and I hope to maintain that status,”
                        said President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>, “but I know
                        a mistake can get immediately magnified. You have been here a long time and
                        I reserve the right to come to you with special problems. I have a genuine
                        desire to work closely with you. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cy
                            Vance</persName> has my permanent authorization to tell you my plans on
                        foreign policy.” Then the President ran down a list of issues under
                        consideration, including <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, Rhodesia,
                        Panama, Middle East, Cyprus and <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">VANCE</persName> spoke to the
                        Congressmen about an immediate problem in Egypt growing out of President
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s removal of subsidy for
                        basic commodities. This resulted in price increases which caused riots in
                        the country. President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> did not
                        handle the situation forcefully and had to lower the prices again to prevent
                        rioting. He was damaged by the way he handled the situation. Egyptian
                        Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName> asked our
                        Ambassador in Egypt for additional economic aid. Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> explained that the Administration
                        proposes to shift funds from long-term development to short-term commodity
                        assistance in order to help Egypt. The total would be $190 million.
                        President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> is the key to the
                        Middle East situation, explained Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                            >Vance</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The PRESIDENT said that everybody knows that <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                            >Sadat</persName> has demonstrated a good attitude and that
                        strengthening him would pay dividends.</p>
                    <p>REPRESENTATIVE <persName corresp="#p_HLH_1">HAMILTON</persName> noted that
                        while there are political reasons to support <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                            >Sadat</persName>, we are making a mistake for the long-range. The
                        commodity import program is difficult to administer and has been “very
                        slippery.” He said that such long-range economic projects as power plants,
                        irrigation projects and industrial credit should not be knocked out because
                        they will be the basis for a sound Egyptian economy. “If the political
                        situation requires it, then reluctantly I guess we must make the move for
                        short-term commodity aid.”</p>
                    <p>SENATOR <persName corresp="#p_CCP_1">CASE</persName> said there is no
                        disagreement with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>’s
                        request in the short-term, but we should reconsider our long-term goals.</p>
                    <p>REPRESENTATIVE <persName corresp="#p_FDB_1">FASCELL</persName> said $190
                        million is not a lot of money and the political pay-off is obvious, but
                        where we go is important. “Egypt is the biggest sinkhole in the Middle East
                        and this is short-<pb n="80" facs="0121" xml:id="pg_80"/>term Band-aid
                        money.” We must look at long-term goals. How much money for an international
                        consortium? How much program money? How far do we go into the short-term
                        economic program? “We got to $900 million before cut off and we didn’t make
                        a dent,” said <persName corresp="#p_FDB_1">Fascell</persName>.</p>
                    <p>REPRESENTATIVE <persName corresp="#p_LCD_1">LONG</persName> said when
                        somebody throws himself on your doorstep, do something. It is surprising
                        they survive at all. Egypt is the most harem scarem country I know. We are
                        inviting the Egyptians to eat up the seed corn. Then Representative
                            <persName corresp="#p_LCD_1">Long</persName> said that the two nuclear
                        reactors for Egypt ought to be cancelled.</p>
                    <p>PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">CARTER</persName> said that the
                        request for nuclear reactors for Egypt and Israel had been left over from
                        the previous Administration and were being reviewed but he gave no
                        indication of how he would act as a result of the review. Rather, the
                        President stressed the current situation in Egypt in terms of the need for
                        food commodities and aid, “I consider it to be a crisis.” The President said
                        that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>’s achievement was
                        to break Egypt away from the Soviets, and more and more Saudi Arabia is
                        taking a tremendous interest in the Middle East. The President said he is
                        asking Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> to evolve a
                        comprehensive four-year goal for our foreign policy.<note n="4"

                            be useful for him to assemble for <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                                >Carter</persName> “a briefing book containing the four-year goals

                                >Carter</persName> approved this suggestion and announced at a
                            January 12 meeting with members of Congress that <persName

                            of such a document. According to the minutes of the January 31 Cabinet
                            meeting, <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> indicated
                            that the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Staff members were
                            currently “working on a four-year foreign policy statement of goals,

                        the preparation of these goals. He said such a compilation would “help me to
                        express our common purposes and what we want to achieve.”</p>
                    <p>DR. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">BRZEZINSKI</persName> explained that the
                        four-year goals in the past have always been statements of broad
                        generalities but “we are trying to make these goals more specific with a
                        little more deliberation and specificity.”</p>
                    <p>REPRESENTATIVE <persName corresp="#p_YCW_1">WILLIAM YOUNG</persName> asked
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> if Foreign Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_FI_1">Fahmy</persName> asked for additional funds.
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">VANCE</persName> said yes, but that to
                        reply rapidly it would have to come from the aid program that had already
                        been approved.</p>
                    <p>SENATOR <persName corresp="#p_BEW3_1">BROOKE</persName> said that President
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> has his priorities and that
                        granting of immediate commodity aid would be a symbolic move.</p>
                    <pb n="81" facs="0122" xml:id="pg_81"/>
                    <p>REPRESENTATIVE <persName corresp="#p_HLH_1">HAMILTON</persName> said that
                        along with granting emergency aid the Egyptians be committed to capital
                        projects in the Suez Canal area.</p>
                    <p>PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">CARTER</persName> then discussed the
                        need to cut back on spending on weapons. He said he hoped, with the aid of
                        Congress, to achieve an overall world-wide reduction in arms transfers. “We
                        are the only nation that can take the lead on arms transfers,” the President
                        said.</p>
                    <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">VANCE</persName> said we are in the
                        process of reviewing our own policies on how to proceed on arms transfers.
                        The principle he wants to see carried out, said Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>, is for arms transfers to be
                        designed to carry out our foreign policy, not to be used as an economic
                        tool. We are putting our thoughts together to get a handle on arms sales
                        problems in the world.</p>
                    <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">VANCE</persName> said he discussed
                        this problem with Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1"
                            >Dobrynin</persName> in reference to the Middle East. <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> did not express opposition but
                        coupled reduction of arms sales with a political solution in the Middle
                        East.</p>
                    <p>REPRESENTATIVE <persName corresp="#p_LCD_1">LONG</persName> said, “We have a
                        tremendous responsibility to make a start on this. If we say, “Let’s have a
                        treaty to limit arms transfers, a rough translation would be, ’let’s not do
                        anything’”. He then raised the question of Egypt’s purchase of $1.6 billion
                        worth of jets from France. “They make no contribution to peace in the Middle
                        East. Why do we give day-to-day aid to Egypt while they buy expensive jets,”
                        asked <persName corresp="#p_LCD_1">Long</persName>.</p>
                    <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">VANCE</persName>. “I have not talked

                        the Soviet Union.<note n="7" xml:id="d19fn7">An unknown hand underlined this

                    <p>PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">CARTER</persName> said there had been
                        some response in Germany and France during Vice President <persName
                            corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName>’s trip on limiting arms sales.
                        “They were not effusive but they responded well,” said the President, “and
                        we must see that France and Germany do not rush in to fill the gap when we
                        limit sales. We are so far ahead that we have a great range of possibilities
                        to moderate our arms sales.”</p>
                    <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">VANCE</persName>. The simple step
                        would be to change the procedures so that arms manufacturers must get
                        advance permission from the Department before they proceed. Now they get
                        people overseas steamed up in an early stage and then come back here and
                        sell their systems.</p>
                    <p>SENATOR <persName corresp="#p_CFF_1">CHURCH</persName>. Arms sales are out of
                        real proportion to the needs of the countries that are buying them.
                        Sometimes it seems that we are exporting only arms and wheat but there is a
                        serious problem with the internal forces in our own country. We have to
                        recognize that aircraft companies have spent millions under the table to
                        stimulate sales.</p>
                    <p>PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">CARTER</persName> stressed that
                        consistency and frankness with Congress and the American people and a
                        multinational approach are vital. THE PRESIDENT said he favored the idea of
                        prior approval of American companies before they offer arms development to
                        foreign countries. The PRESIDENT also made these points: (1) he wants to
                        hold down the volume of nuclear weapons and the volume of nuclear
                        capability. He said this goal was pursued with France and Germany and he was
                        meeting with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        later in the morning to discuss this problem.<note n="8" xml:id="d19fn8">The

                    <p>SECRETARY <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">VANCE</persName>. There is no question

                        years Egypt’s foreign policy is not based on playing the Russians off
                        against us. Egypt is susceptible to an accommodation with Israel and has
                        moved away from Arab socialism. The long range problem is radicalization of
                        the country and it is a perilous race. A weak economy can produce political
                        instability and bring a radical regime to power that will take a more

                    <p>At his first press conference, held in the Old Executive Office Building on
                        February 8, 1977, at 2:30 p.m., President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Jimmy Carter</persName> discussed the impact addressing human rights
                        concerns might have on U.S.-Soviet relations:</p>
                    <p>“Q. Mr. President, there have been a series of actions taken in recent days
                        by the Soviet Union, including the expulsion of American journalists and the
                        arrest of <persName corresp="#p_GA_1">Alexander Ginsburg</persName>, actions
                        that we have taken issue with in one form or another. How concerned are you
                        that by being outspoken on issues of human rights that we may jeopardize
                        possibly our relations with the Soviet Union on other matters?</p>
                    <p>“The President. Well, this brings up the question that is referred to as
                        linkage. I think we come out better in dealing with the Soviet Union if I am
                        consistently and completely dedicated to the enhancement of human rights,
                        not only as it deals with the Soviet Union but all other countries. I think
                        this can legitimately be severed from our inclination to work with the
                        Soviet Union, for instance, in reducing dependence upon atomic weapons and
                        also in seeking mutual and balanced force reductions in Europe.</p>
                    <pb n="86" facs="0127" xml:id="pg_86"/>
                    <p>“I don’t want the two to be tied together. I think the previous
                        administration, under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName>, thought that there ought to be this linkage; that
                        if you mentioned human rights or if you failed to invite Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SA_4">Solzhenitsyn</persName> to the White House that you
                        might endanger the progress of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        talks.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t feel that way. I think it ought to be clear, and I have made clear
                        directly in communication to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLI_1"
                            >Brezhnev</persName> and in my meeting with Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName>, that I was reserving the right
                        to speak out strong and forcefully whenever human rights are threatened—not
                        every instance, but when I think it is advisable. This is not intended as a
                        public relations attack on the Soviet Union, and I would hope that their
                        leaders could recognize the American people’s deep concern about human
                        rights.</p>
                    <p>“I think in many other countries of the world there has been some progress. I
                        think in the Soviet Union there has already been some progress. The number
                        of Jews, for instance, who have been permitted to emigrate from the Soviet
                        Union in the last few months has increased.</p>
                    <p>“If this trend should continue, I would be encouraged. But I would have to
                        take this position of being independent in my own public pronouncements.
                        I’ve got a lot to learn. I was concerned the other day, for instance, when
                        the <gloss target="#t_AP_1">AP</gloss> reporter [George Krimsky] was
                        expelled from Moscow. I had at first thought to retaliate by expelling the
                            <gloss target="#t_AP_1">AP</gloss> reporter from Washington. But I found
                        out that was not the right approach to take.</p>
                    <p>“But we have got to be firm, and we have got to be forceful. But I don’t want
                        to tie everything together in one package so that we are timid about
                        insisting on human rights.</p>
                    <p>“Q. Do you interpret this in any way as a kind of testing of you by the
                        Soviet Union?</p>
                    <p>“The President. No, I don’t. I don’t interpret it as a testing. I regret the
                        fact that the Soviet Union saw fit to expel a newspaper reporter. I regret
                        very deeply the fact that the Soviet Union has now incarcerated Mr.
                        Ginsburg, who has been one of the leaders in the Soviet Union in
                        representing the case of the dissidents. But I can’t go in with armed forces
                        and try to change the internal mechanism of the Soviet Government.</p>
                    <p>“But I don’t think it is designed to aggravate me or to test me or to test
                        the will of this country. My commitment to human rights is clear. I will
                        maintain that clarity to the maximum extent possible.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t want to mislead the American people in dealing with the Soviets or
                        with others. We can’t expect overnight success. It requires long, tedious,
                        labored, very carefully considered progress. I am not looking for magic
                        answers but my determination is very deep.” (<hi rend="italic">Public

                        describing frankly some of the crucial issues that face our country. The

                        rights. I spelled out in general terms our positions on these issues and
                        intend to keep the press conferences on schedule and not evade issues any

                    <p>Surely the Soviets are sophisticated enough to understand that the domestic

                        foreign assistance program we should ask ourselves certain key
                        questions:</p>
                    <p>—How do these programs fit together?</p>
                    <p>—What are the results of our aid in human terms?</p>
                    <p>—What ends are served?</p>
                    <p>—In short, is our aid money being wisely spent?</p>
                    <pb n="89" facs="0130" xml:id="pg_89"/>
                    <p>I hope to begin this difficult process of self-examination and cooperative
                        dialogue with the Congress today—to provide you with a sense of how the
                        Administration sees the total range of our foreign assistance programs as
                        part of a broad foreign policy framework including:</p>
                    <p>—Our efforts at development cooperation in the context of an increasingly
                        important North-South dialogue;</p>
                    <p>—Our ability to play a constructive role in the resolution of regional
                        conflict in the Middle East, southern Africa, and other trouble spots in the
                        world; and</p>
                    <p>—Our basic national security.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Our Basic Objectives</p>
                    <p>The foreign assistance efforts of the <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> Administration are guided by some fundamental foreign
                        policy objectives:</p>
                    <p>—To demonstrate America’s compassion for the poor and dispossessed around the
                        world—those who, through no fault of their own, are exposed to daily
                        suffering and humiliation and are struggling to survive;</p>
                    <p>—To make our fair contribution to the enormous task of the social, economic,
                        and technological development of poor countries, an investment which in this
                        interdependent world can pay us handsome dividends;</p>
                    <p>—To foster a climate of constructive cooperation, dialogue, and reciprocal
                        benefit in our North-South diplomacy;</p>
                    <p>—To contribute to the cause of peace by providing incentives, in terms of
                        economic and physical security, for the resolution of old, and potential,
                        disputes;</p>
                    <p>—To maintain and foster the environment of international peace and security
                        essential to social, economic, and political progress through selective
                        military assistance that assures our friends and allies adequate
                        self-defense, while preserving regional arms balances;</p>
                    <p>—To take the lead in encouraging the evolution of a world order based on an
                        open economic system, a political structure reflecting a just balance of
                        rights and obligations for all nations, and social progress and human rights
                        for individuals wherever they might be.</p>
                    <p>This wide range of objectives is essential to the national interest of the
                        United States in the complicated interdependent world in which we live.</p>
                    <p>Our own economic welfare is vitally affected by what happens elsewhere in the
                        world. The standard of living of the American worker and the American
                        consumer requires cooperation with the developing world—in expanding
                        supplies of food, energy, and raw materials and in controlling population
                        growth and wasteful use of scarce natural re<pb n="90" facs="0131"
                            xml:id="pg_90"/>sources. The stability of the U.S. economy depends
                        greatly on responsible economic policies in the rest of the world, including
                        the developing nations. The fortunes of all national economies, including
                        our own, are linked to continued expansion of the highly integrated
                        international system of trade, investment, and finance. And in a world in
                        which social and economic progress has become a central issue of our time,
                        our national security is linked to progress in the rest of the world.</p>
                    <p>In addition, economic issues have assumed increasing political importance.
                        Disadvantaged people everywhere are rejecting the proposition that poverty
                        must be their fate, and governments everywhere are putting the goal of
                        economic development at the top of their national agendas. We have
                        experienced severe worldwide economic dislocation: simultaneous inflation
                        and recession and abrupt increases in energy prices have curtailed economic
                        growth generally, but most painfully in the poorest countries. Equality of
                        economic opportunity has become the paramount goal of diplomacy for 150
                        developing nations, just as it has been the goal of disadvantaged citizens
                        and regions in American history.</p>
                    <p>We cannot effectively promote multilateral diplomacy, control the
                        proliferation of nuclear arms, defuse international terrorism, reduce the
                        buildup of conventional weapons, or protect our security interests in the
                        oceans or space in a hungry, angry, and bitter world. We can achieve
                        cooperation on these security issues only if we are doing our fair and
                        reasonable share in the process of international development
                        cooperation—only if we are seen as encouraging, not frustrating, the
                        development aspirations of others.</p>
                    <p>In an imperfect world, the objectives we pose for our foreign policy are not
                        always consistent. We cannot pursue all of them as fully as we might like
                        all the time. In concrete instances we face a series of difficult choices.
                        Some of these choices pit our best intentions against our most pragmatic
                        calculations.</p>
                    <p>For example, both we and the poorer countries favor economic development, and
                        we generally agree that development requires sound domestic policies as well
                        as international transfers of resources to the poor countries. Moreover, one
                        of our principal objectives is to see that the poorest people of the
                        developing nations benefit from our assistance.</p>
                    <p>Our task is to achieve those ends without interfering in the internal affairs
                        of other countries, mindful of the fact that there are limits to what we can
                        achieve no matter how noble our motives.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, we hold strongly to the principles of basic human rights. We are
                        working to fulfill both the letter and spirit of current legislation
                        relating human rights concerns to foreign assistance. This committee it<pb

                        would cause the erosion of our greatest strength—that of a nation guided by
                        dictates of reason and moral principles.</p>
                    <p>But in that report the committee also noted that we can best achieve our
                        purpose through conscientious and systematic review of assistance programs
                        on a country-by-country basis. In each case we must balance a political
                        concern for human rights against economic or security goals. No formula can
                        resolve the larger conflict of commitments, but prudent and dedicated
                        attention to both the basic objectives and the day-to-day operations of our
                        programs can make specific problems tractable.</p>
                    <p>This committee and the Congress have advocated “new directions” in our

                            provisions of the “New Directions” mandate, which set out functional

                        attention to human rights, and adherence to the moral principles that give
                        us pride and dignity as a nation. The spirit of “new directions” underlies
                        our general approach to all our aid programs.</p>

                    <p>The challenge of the “new directions” means that, in 1977, we cannot talk
                        simply in the dry terms of this or that funding level as if the power to

                    <head>23. Editorial Note</head>
                    <p>During the course of his remarks before an audience of Department of State
                        employees on February 24, 1977, President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Jimmy Carter</persName> underscored his dedication to improving
                        relations with adversaries in pursuit of peace and informing the American
                        public about his administration’s foreign policy:</p>
                    <p>“The final point I want to make before I answer your questions is this: We
                        have some potential adversaries and some past adversaries with whom we want
                        to have better relationships. And that applies to Vietnam and Laos and
                        Cambodia. It applies even to North Korea and to Cuba. It applies to the
                        People’s Republic of China and to Russia and to countries like Iraq. With
                        some we have relations; some, as you know, we do not. But our constant
                        search will be to find common ground on which we can reach agreement so that
                        we can set an example for the rest of the world in a friendly and mutually
                        respectful attitude.</p>
                    <p>“I have been pleased so far at the response that has been received from our
                        embryonic efforts to carve out grounds for understanding and peace. I think
                        so far the Soviet Union has responded well. And we will continue these kinds
                        of efforts, sometimes anticipating discouragements. But we will not be
                        deterred, and we will not be discouraged ourselves.</p>
                    <p>“I want the American people to be a part of it. I am going to have a press
                        conference at least twice a month. I will have frequent fireside chats. My
                        next one will be devoted exclusively to foreign affairs and defense matters.
                        And I am going to have trips around our country where I might meet in town
                        meeting forums. And we will have call-in type radio programs so that people
                        can ask me questions about domestic and foreign affairs and so that to the
                        best of my ability I can give them straight answers.</p>
                    <p>“I think that when our country speaks, it ought to speak with a strong voice.
                        And when a foreign policy is evolved, even though it might be the right
                        foreign policy, exclusively by the President and the Secretary of State, and
                        then promulgated to the world without the understanding or participation of
                        the Congress, the other Cabinet members or the people of our country, the
                        rest of the world knows that the President and the Secretary of State,
                        powerful people, still speak with a hollow voice. So to the extent that you
                        are involved in the evolution of an idea or a new approach or a consistent
                        old approach, to that extent, we will all be strengthened.</p>
                    <p>“We are partners. I can’t succeed as President unless you succeed. And if you
                        make a serious mistake, I am the one who will be the focal point for that
                        criticism and that despair and that disillusionment that <pb n="93"
                            facs="0134" xml:id="pg_93"/>will follow. I think when we do make a
                        mistake we ought to be frank about it and say we erred and this is the
                        corrective action that we will take. And we will try to correct our error,
                        and we will try to do better next time.</p>
                    <p>“I think the American people will respond well. And I think other nations
                        that look to us for leadership will respond well, also.</p>
                    <p>“I want to make sure that we eliminate in our own country those vestiges of
                        hatred or discrimination or deprivation of human rights that we still retain
                        so that when we do criticize other countries, or when we do speak out to
                        deplore the loss of those rights in other nations, that we, ourselves, might
                        be free of justified criticism.</p>
                    <p>“Well, all these matters that have just come to my mind as I stand here
                        before you are important to us all. And I just want to be sure that we work
                        in harmony to alleviate tensions and to reinspire those who can
                        legitimately, I hope, in the future look to us for justified inspiration.”

                    <p>On the other hand, there may be even more compelling arguments for your

                    <p>—Stress the connection between <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> domestic
                        and diplomatic interests—particularly in the so-called “new issue
                        areas”;</p>

                    <p>We believe that any one of the following topics might serve such functions,
                        and would be pleased to help draft submissions for your review:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Economic Issues</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>a. <hi rend="italic">General</hi>—A more conceptually-oriented discussion
                        could revolve around <hi rend="italic">Shared Challenges Before
                            Post-Industrial Society</hi>—or how the trilateral partnership hits
                        home. A combination of factors—the President’s campaign stress on working
                        with allied industrial democracies, the problems they have in common
                        (economic recovery, decreased confidence in government, crises of crime and
                        urban decay) and related policy issues (need for more economic policy
                        coordination/planning within and among the developed nations?)—suggest the
                        value of a short, potentially provocative presentation.</p>
                    <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Specific cases</hi>—You might get at some of the same
                        points by using a specific concrete problem—like pending trade challenges on
                        shoes or specialty steel—as a microcosm of problems that affect broader
                        domestic and diplomatic interests. For example, a cutback on shoe imports
                        could both affect <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> jobs and consumer
                        prices and influence <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> relations with our
                        Western European Allies, prospects for democratic progress in Southern
                        Europe, prospects for trade liberalization at the Geneva trade talks,<note

                    <p>The growing problem of illegal immigration is another example of one specific
                        question which reflects a range of larger issues: bilateral relations with
                        Mexico, Korea, and the Caribbean nations; overall international population
                        policy, and the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> job situation.</p>

                        environment, science and technology, North-South dialogue) and upcoming

                        just one of the above—energy might be most topical—and stress the connection
                        between domestic and international efforts on conservation, diversification
                        of supply, and longer-term research and development.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Multilateral Diplomacy:</hi> Few organizations may be as

                        appreciation for multilateral diplomacy and affirm links with domestic
                        concerns.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Human Rights:</hi> It’s in the headlines—replete with
                        complexity, contradiction, and potential backfire from abroad and at home. A

                        approaches, and problems we foresee might elicit helpful discussion.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>As you requested, we have prepared an outline of a speech which the President
                        could deliver at the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> General Assembly in
                        late March.<note n="2" xml:id="d25fn2">The President delivered a speech at
                            the United Nations on March 17; see <ref target="#d28">Documents
                                28</ref> and <ref target="#d29">29</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>We see the speech as a major opportunity for the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> to take the high ground in its relations with the new
                        countries—to demonstrate that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> seeks a
                        new era of sympathetic and mutually beneficial relationships—to give new
                        impetus to cooperative and productive work in international
                        organizations.</p>
                    <p>The overall theme we have in mind is this: the time has come to address
                        global problems in a manner which serves the interests of all peoples. That
                        must be the purpose of all of our efforts. But we can act effectively only
                        by acting together to meet common problems and to realize common
                        benefits.</p>
                    <p>In suggesting this theme we have in mind that the President could capitalize
                        on his worldwide reputation as a leader genuinely interested in improving
                        life for the poor and the disadvantaged.</p>
                    <p>A possible title for the speech might be: “The Quality of Peace”.</p>
                    <p>The basic structure would be as follows:</p>
                    <p>—First, a section on the global challenge and the opportunity that we and all
                        other nations are facing.</p>
                    <p>—Second, a section on what the United States will stand for in the <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> Administration, setting forth
                        broad principles and purposes.</p>
                    <p>—Third, what we intend to do regarding selected major problems, including the
                        role of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> itself.</p>
                    <pb n="97" facs="0138" xml:id="pg_97"/>
                    <p>—Fourth, a final section on what we are asking of others—the other industrial
                        countries, the developing nations, the Soviets, etc. The last section would
                        drive home the fundamental theme of the speech.</p>
                    <p>This structure should permit us considerable flexibility. Various ideas, and
                        possible initiatives, can be considered for inclusion under the different
                        major headings. In addition, this kind of structure could help us to keep
                        things within manageable length since it would be clear from the
                        presentation that the President is not attempting under any one item to
                        provide an exhaustive statement of the problem or of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> policies.</p>

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Policy Design.</hi> Judging from press
                        reactions—both domestic and foreign—there is considerable appreciation of
                        your dedication to more effective and far-reaching strategic arms control;
                        there is awareness of the depth and sincerity of your concern over nuclear
                        proliferation; there is remarkably widespread support for your position on
                        human rights, which has done so much to revarnish America’s moral
                        credentials.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, through the various missions undertaken immediately after the
                        inaugural (to Southern Africa, to the Middle East, to Panama, and to the
                        Aegean) you have signaled clearly that the Administration will be activist,
                        and that you yourself will be in the tradition of those presidents who have
                        exercised a personally active leadership in foreign affairs.</p>
                    <p>However, I do not believe that at this stage the larger design of what you
                        wish to accomplish has emerged with sufficiently sharp relief. I discern two
                        immediate needs, both of which might well be corrected in your forthcoming
                        foreign policy speech:</p>
                    <p>1. You need to express a more coherent vision of what we aim to accomplish,
                        of what our priorities are, and of how you define the present historical era
                        within which <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> foreign policy has to be
                        shaped;</p>
                    <p>2. You need to convey to the public your awareness of the complexity of the
                        problems that we confront; disappointments and setbacks are normal in
                        international affairs and accomplishments tend to be the exception. We are
                        setting in motion a process, and the public must be made to understand that
                        the President and his associates un<pb n="99" facs="0140" xml:id="pg_99"
                        />derstand that the problems we face will be with us for a long time to
                        come, that there will be no easy solutions, and that the effort to build a
                        more cooperative world framework will be tedious, painful, and frequently
                        disappointing.</p>
                    <p>I think it is necessary to emphasize these themes especially because we are
                        likely to confront two short-term dangers:</p>
                    <p>1. Given our disagreements with the French and the Germans over nuclear

                        disappointments with the British and the French over the Concorde,<note

                        it is possible that in the short-term our relations with our principal
                        allies may in fact deteriorate. Since this will be coinciding with the
                        forthcoming summit, we should anticipate some rough sailing in alliance
                            relations.<note n="4" xml:id="d26fn4">Reference is to the economic

                        but it is bound to produce some adverse comments, especially since we have
                        put so much stress on giving priority attention to better relations with our
                        friends. Your critics, both at home and abroad, will certainly emphasize
                        such frictions as evidence of our inability to do what we said we would
                        strive to accomplish. A more specific policy implication of the foregoing
                        might be a more concerted effort on our part to try to minimize the negative
                        fallout from both the nuclear proliferation and the Concorde problems, as
                        well as more stress on those aspects on which we are in fundamental
                        agreement with our allies.</p>
                    <p>2. Secondly, it is likely that in the foreseeable future our negotiations
                        with the Soviets over <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> may prove more
                        rocky and difficult than the public has been led to expect. The Brezhnev
                        response to you might be a foretaste of some very hard bargaining, and it is
                        quite conceivable that our first report to the American people on <gloss

                        areas of agreement but the reasons why we have been unable to agree.<note

                        he will be justifying to his friends in the arms control community why it
                        was impossible for the United States to accept disadvantageous Soviet terms.
                        Such an ironical twist, incidentally, might make <persName

                    <p>All of the foregoing points to the proposition that the time is now ripe for
                        doing precisely what you have determined to do: to deliver a formal,
                        comprehensive, and systematic speech. In my judgment, it should be short on
                        promises, it should be analytical, and it should seek to integrate the
                        various strands discussed above into a broader approach.<note n="6"

                        have important security relationships but also for the basic concept of
                        multilateral assistance.</p>
                    <p>Efforts to use multilateral institutions in the human rights field have many

                        making human rights an important concern of U.S. foreign policy. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> began this
                        Administration with the inaugural pledge that “Because we are free we can

                        freedom elsewhere.”<note n="2" xml:id="d27fn2">See <ref target="#d15"
                                >Document 15</ref>.</note> Then, in his confirmation hearings,
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> stated that “we must
                        have policies based upon fundamental values. In particular, we must stand
                        for human rights.”<note n="3" xml:id="d27fn3">See <ref target="#d14"

                    </p>
                    <p>The concern for human rights will be woven into the fabric of our foreign
                        policy. If we are to do justice to our goals, we must act always with a
                        concern to achieve practical results and with an awareness of the other
                        demands on our diplomacy. When it is desirable to do so, we will speak out,
                        trying to be neither strident nor polemical. This is not a one-way street,
                        and we must expect that at times others may criticize us. We may decide to
                        communicate by quiet diplomacy with the country involved to see what can be
                        accomplished that way. Or we may prefer to approach the problem not
                        bilaterally, but through multilateral channels. In some instances of human
                        rights violations, assistance programs may be curtailed, but we must also
                        recognize that to be evenhanded, we should not just penalize but also
                        inspire, persuade, and reward.</p>
                    <p>Already our commitment has prompted definite actions. In pursuit of the goal
                        of majority rule and equal rights in Southern Rhodesia, we have urged the

                        work of the [U.N.] Human Rights Commission.</p>
                    <p>As an example of our humanitarian concern for the uprooted and dispossessed,
                        I would observe that during fiscal year 1976 our government has expended
                        some $475 million on assistance to refugees on a worldwide basis, and the
                        United States accepted 31,000 refugees for permanent resettlement in this
                        country. We are of course continuing our generous assistance to refugees in
                        the current year.</p>
                    <pb n="104" facs="0145" xml:id="pg_104"/>
                    <p>We know that the Congress shares this commitment to human rights and deserves
                        special credit for its attention to this issue in recent years.</p>
                    <p>The complexity of the challenge compels collaboration between us. By working
                        together more closely and effectively we can restore confidence both at home
                        and abroad in our undertaking to encourage respect for human rights. The
                        Administration, as well as the Congress, must reflect in our policies the
                        values of the American people.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that these first steps we have taken are just that. Change takes
                        time—as demonstrated by the evolution of human rights within our own
                        country: from religious freedom through the Bill of Rights, the abolition of
                        slavery, universal suffrage, the four freedoms, the civil rights movement,
                        and the struggle against poverty to the Equal Rights Amendment. It is a
                        long, hard climb. But the course is firmly set.</p>
                    <p>There should be no mistake: The undertaking to promote human rights is now an
                        integral part of our foreign policy. We know that domestic support for our
                        policies will falter if they do not reflect traditional American values. But
                        I want it to be clear that this is not a policy of convenience, adopted
                        because of its popularity at home. A commitment to human rights protects the
                        domestic vitality of these values, keeping clear our image of ourselves and
                        encouraging us to make the democratic system work. It helps us to maintain
                        leadership of the free societies that share similar values. And it serves as
                        a pole of attraction to other states and peoples.</p>
                    <p>The question is neither the direction nor the strength of our commitment. The
                        question we must answer is how to summon the statesmanship and the moral
                        courage to deal with the practical dilemmas and complexities in promoting
                        human rights in our foreign relations. Today I want to discuss briefly the
                        complexities in linking human rights considerations to economic and security
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>The United States recognizes a wide range of human rights and believes all
                        must be promoted. Our most concentrated areas of concern have been
                        violations of the integrity of the person—officially sanctioned murders,
                        tortures, or detentions without trial. These, of course, are areas
                        emphasized by the legislation you approved. Political rights and civil
                        protection are also accorded high priority.</p>
                    <p>At times it is inevitable that these concerns will conflict with our
                        commitment to the goal of economic development. As Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> has stated, one of our fundamental

                    <p>Other conflicts in policy may arise when the security of the United States is
                        linked to that of a country whose human rights priorities are deficient. It
                        should be uppermost in our minds that security assistance is rendered to
                        maintain or enhance our own security, not to strengthen the hand of a
                        repressive regime, although we must face up to that as an undesired and
                        unintended consequence in certain cases.</p>
                    <p>We are working to fulfill both the letter and the spirit of current
                        legislation relating human rights concerns to foreign assistance. We can
                        best achieve this purpose through conscientious and systematic review of
                        assistance programs on a country-by-country basis, in each case balancing a
                        political concern for human rights against economic or security goals. In
                        multilateral development banks the United States must work to maintain a
                        broad international consensus and to avoid destructive bloc politics that
                        would impair the pursuit of the banks’ development objectives. No formula
                        can resolve the larger conflicts of these positions, but prudent and
                        dedicated attention to both the basic objectives and the day-to-day
                        operations of our programs can make specific problems more tractable.</p>
                    <p>We have been developing a series of questions by which to chart the direction
                        of our policy and our progress. Taken together as points of reference, they
                        will make us surer of our basic course and less likely to be driven from it
                        by the force of a particular circumstance. The questions we are considering
                        include:</p>
                    <p>1. Will our action be useful in promoting the cause of human rights? Will it
                        actually improve the human rights situation at hand? Or is it likely to make
                        it worse?</p>
                    <p>2. What will be the most effective means of expressing our views? Quiet
                        diplomacy? A public pronouncement? Withdrawal of aid or other tangible
                        sanctions?</p>
                    <p>3. Even when there is only a remote chance that our action will be
                        influential, does our sense of values, our American ethic, prompt us to
                        speak out or take action?</p>
                    <p>4. Will others support us? Can we expect the aid of national and
                        international organizations dedicated to furthering human rights?</p>
                    <p>5. Have we steered away from the self-righteous and strident, remembering
                        that our own record is not unblemished?</p>
                    <p>6. Finally, have we remembered national security interests and kept our sense
                        of perspective, realizing that human rights cannot <pb n="106" facs="0147"
                            xml:id="pg_106"/>flourish in a world impoverished by economic decline or
                        ravaged by armed conflict?</p>
                    <p>The Administration alone cannot take all the actions that should be part of
                        this government’s efforts on behalf of human rights. The Congress has a
                        unique role to play by reflecting public concern for human rights in the
                        laws it passes and monitoring their implementation, by forming and funding
                        assistance programs, and by assuring that our domestic law is in conformity
                        with our international obligations.</p>
                    <p>We urge that you join us in giving present legislation with human rights
                        provisions a chance to work and that we carefully consider together any new
                        legislation. As a matter of especially high priority, we also urge your
                        support for repeal of the Byrd amendment.</p>
                    <p>The first weeks of the <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>
                        Administration have been a time of change and, we believe, a time of renewed
                        hope for the advancement of human rights. We believe our general emphasis on
                        this important arena of international concern has already begun to have a
                        favorable impact. Last week, in a major foreign policy statement, the
                        British Government declared a policy comparable to that of this
                            Administration.<note n="8" xml:id="d27fn8">In a March 3 address to the

                        human rights and pursue human rights objectives through their diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>In a number of countries, important segments of the population have been
                        stirred to raise human rights issues internally. And in several countries,
                        governments have taken positive steps, such as the release of political
                        prisoners, which demonstrate that the voice of this Administration is being
                        heard and listened to. This reaction encourages us along the path we have
                        set.</p>

                        briefing to the press at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in New York
                        the afternoon of March 17, 1977, in advance of President <persName

                        Nations <pb n="107" facs="0148" xml:id="pg_107"/>General Assembly that
                        evening. After a short introduction by Associate Press Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_SJ_1">Jerry Schecter</persName>, <persName
                            corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> indicated that he would
                        describe the nature and basic purpose of the speech, outline the conceptual
                        structure, and draw attention to specific themes:</p>
                    <p>“Insofar as the first point is concerned—the nature and basic purpose of the
                        speech—it is seen by us as a basic effort to define the President’s broad
                        agenda for the future. It is not designed per se to advance specific
                        proposals, though it does, as I will note subsequently, contain proposals.
                        But it is primarily to set the framework of directions, to define the broad
                        aspirations of the Administration in the field of international
                        politics.</p>
                    <p>“In so doing, he has chosen this particular forum for his address in order
                        also to underline his fundamental support for the institutions of the United
                        Nations, for multilateral international cooperation. That was a very
                        deliberate choice of the setting for his first major address in foreign
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>“In the course of this address, he also wishes to outline his substantive
                        priorities.</p>
                    <p>“And the speech, as you all know from having read it, focuses on three
                        substantive priorities of his foreign policy—namely, the issue of arms
                        control; secondly, the issue of North/South economic development; and,
                        thirdly, the issue of human rights.</p>
                    <p>“In talking about the basic purpose and the fundamental thrust of the speech,
                        let me make two additional points. The President has already demonstrated,
                        by sending Vice President <persName corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName> on
                        his trip, that his basic focus is on close international cooperation, in the
                        first instance, with our principal allies but, beyond that, with the
                        international community as a whole. And secondly, the President in this
                        speech, as well as in his other statements, has already reasserted the basic
                        role of the President as the articulator of foreign policy and this he has
                        done quite consciously and, in so doing, is also assuming the traditional
                        role of the President as the public educator on policy issues. And his
                        statements on foreign policy, this one as well as others, are designed also
                        to enlighten public opinion, the public at large, on the nature of the
                        fundamental problems that we confront and the kind of solutions which
                        patiently, prudently, have to be sought in dealing with these problems.</p>
                    <p>“Let me secondly now say a word or two of the structure, the conceptual
                        structure of the speech as it is perceived by us. It is essentially based on
                        five fundamental parts.</p>
                    <p>“The first is an explicit affirmation of the President’s recognition of the
                        essential intractability and complexity of international problems, his
                        recognition that there are no easy solutions to existing difficulties—that
                        the process of dealing with them will be a prolonged one, requiring
                        sustained commitment from the American people.</p>
                    <pb n="108" facs="0149" xml:id="pg_108"/>
                    <p>“Secondly, the speech expresses the need for international cooperation in
                        dealing with these problems. It takes as its point of departure the premise
                        that while the United States can actively serve as an energizer, it cannot
                        solve these problems by itself and that wider international cooperation is
                        needed. And, in so doing, the President engages in a brief tour d’horizon of
                        the fundamental areas in which international cooperation is either to be
                        expected or is needed.</p>
                    <p>“And then, thirdly, he goes on to outline the three substantive priorities to
                        which I’ve already made reference: arms control, economic development, and
                        human rights.” (Carter Library, National Security Affairs, Brzezinski

                    <p>We are proud that for the 32 years since its creation, the United Nations has
                        met on American soil. And we share with you the commitments of freedom,
                        self-government, human dignity, mutual toleration, and the peaceful
                        resolution of disputes—which the founding principles of the United Nations
                        and also Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_WK_1">Kurt
                            Waldheim</persName> so well represent.</p>
                    <p>No one nation by itself can build a world which reflects all these fine
                        values. But the United States, my own country, has a reservoir of
                        strength—economic strength, which we are willing to share; military
                        strength, which we hope never to use again; and the strength of ideals,
                        which are determined fully to maintain the backbone of our own foreign
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>It is now 8 weeks since I became President. I have brought to office a firm
                        commitment to a more open foreign policy. And I believe that the American
                        people expect me to speak frankly about the policies that we intend to
                        pursue, and it is in that spirit that I speak to you tonight about our own
                        hopes for the future.</p>
                    <p>I see a hopeful world, a world dominated by increasing demands for basic
                        freedoms, for fundamental rights, for higher standards of human existence.
                        We are eager to take part in the shaping of that world.</p>
                    <p>But in seeking such a better world, we are not blind to the reality of
                        disagreement, nor to the persisting dangers that confront us all. Every
                        headline reminds us of bitter divisions, of national hostilities, of
                        territorial conflicts, of ideological competition.</p>
                    <p>In the Middle East, peace is a quarter of a century overdue. A gathering
                        racial conflict threatens southern Africa; new tensions are rising in the
                        Horn of Africa. Disputes in the eastern Mediterranean remain to be
                        resolved.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps even more ominous is the staggering arms race. The Soviet Union and
                        the United States have accumulated thousands of nuclear weapons. Our two
                        nations now have five times more missile warheads today than we had just 8
                        years ago. But we are not five times more secure. On the contrary, the arms
                        race has only increased the risk of conflict.</p>
                    <p>We can only improve this world if we are realistic about its complexities.
                        The disagreements that we face are deeply rooted, and they often raise
                        difficult philosophical as well as territorial issues. They will not be
                        solved easily. They will not be solved quickly. The arms race is now
                        embedded in the very fabric of international affairs and can only be
                        contained with the greatest difficulty. Poverty and inequality are of such
                        monumental scope that it will take decades of deliberate and determined
                        effort even to improve the situation substantially.</p>
                    <pb n="110" facs="0151" xml:id="pg_110"/>
                    <p>I stress these dangers and these difficulties because I want all of us to
                        dedicate ourselves to a prolonged and persistent effort designed first to
                        maintain peace and to reduce the arms race; second, to build a better and a
                        more cooperative international economic system; and third, to work with
                        potential adversaries as well as our close friends to advance the cause of
                        human rights.</p>
                    <p>In seeking these goals, I realize that the United States cannot solve the
                        problems of the world. We can sometimes help others resolve their
                        differences, but we cannot do so by imposing our own particular
                        solutions.</p>
                    <p>In the coming months, there is important work for all of us in advancing
                        international cooperation and economic progress in the cause of peace.</p>
                    <p>Later this spring, the leaders of several industrial nations of Europe, North
                        America, and Japan will confer at a summit meeting in London on a broad

                    <p>In the Middle East we are doing our best to clarify areas of disagreement, to
                        surface underlying consensus, and to help to develop mutually acceptable
                        principles that can form a flexible framework for a just and a permanent

                        region of the world. Anything less than that may bring a protracted racial

                        reconciliation with all states which are ready to work with us in promoting
                        global progress and global peace.</p>
                    <p>Above all, the search for peace requires a much more deliberate effort to
                        contain the global arms race. Let me speak in this context, first, of the
                        U.S.-Soviet Union relationship, and then of the wider need to contain the
                        proliferation of arms throughout the global community.</p>

                        <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> is extraordinarily complicated. But
                        the basic fact is that while negotiations remain deadlocked, the arms race
                        goes on; the security of both countries and the entire world is
                        threatened.</p>
                    <p>My preference would be for strict controls or even a freeze on new types and
                        new generations of weaponry and with a deep reduction in the strategic arms
                        of both sides. Such a major step towards not only arms limitation but arms
                        reduction would be welcomed by mankind as a giant step towards peace.</p>
                    <p>Alternatively, and perhaps much more easily, we could conclude a limited
                        agreement based on those elements of the Vladivostok accord on which we can
                        find complete consensus, and set aside for prompt consideration and
                        subsequent negotiations the more contentious issues and also the deeper
                        reductions in nuclear weapons which I favor.</p>
                    <p>We will also explore the possibility of a total cessation of nuclear testing.
                        While our ultimate goal is for all nuclear powers to end testing, we do not
                        regard this as a prerequisite for the suspension of tests by the two
                        principal nuclear powers, the Soviet Union and the United States.</p>
                    <p>We should, however, also pursue a broad, permanent multilateral agreement on
                        this issue.</p>
                    <p>We will also seek to establish Soviet willingness to reach agreement with us
                        on mutual military restraint in the Indian Ocean, as well as on such matters
                        as arms exports to the troubled areas of the world.</p>
                    <p>In proposing such accommodations I remain fully aware that American-Soviet
                        relations will continue to be highly competitive—but I believe that our
                        competition must be balanced by cooperation in preserving peace, and thus
                        our mutual survival.</p>
                    <p>I will seek such cooperation with the Soviet Union—earnestly, constantly, and
                        sincerely.</p>
                    <p>However, the effort to contain the arms race is not a matter just for the
                        United States and Soviet Union alone. There must be a wider effort to reduce
                        the flow of weapons to all the troubled spots of this globe.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, we will try to reach broader agreements among producer and
                        consumer nations to limit the export of conventional arms, and we,
                        ourselves, will take the initiative on our own because the United States has
                        become one of the major arms suppliers of the world.</p>
                    <p>We are deeply committed to halting the proliferation of nuclear weapons. And
                        we will undertake a new effort to reach multilateral agreements designed to
                        provide legitimate supplies of nuclear fuels for the production of energy,
                        while controlling the poisonous and dangerous atomic wastes.</p>
                    <p>Working with other nations represented here, we hope to advance the cause of
                        peace. We will make a strong and a positive contribution at <pb n="113"

                    </p>
                    <p>But the search for peace also means the search for justice. One of the
                        greatest challenges before us as a nation, and therefore one of our greatest
                        opportunities, is to participate in molding a global economic system which
                        will bring greater prosperity to all the people of all countries.</p>
                    <p>I come from a part of the United States which is largely agrarian and which
                        for many years did not have the advantages of adequate transportation or
                        capital or management skills or education which were available in the
                        industrial States of our country.</p>
                    <p>So, I can sympathize with the leaders of the developing nations, and I want
                        them to know that we will do our part.</p>
                    <p>To this end, the United States will be advancing proposals aimed at meeting
                        the basic human needs of the developing world and helping them to increase
                        their productive capacity. I have asked Congress to provide $7½ billion of
                        foreign assistance in the coming year, and I will work to ensure sustained
                        American assistance as the process of global economic development

                        also urging the Congress of our country to increase our contributions to the
                        United Nations Development Program and meet in full our pledges to
                        multilateral lending institutions, especially the International Development
                        Association of the World Bank.</p>
                    <p>We remain committed to an open international trading system, one which does
                        not ignore domestic concerns in the United States. We have extended
                        duty-free treatment to many products from the developing countries. In the
                        multilateral trade agreements in Geneva we have offered substantial trade
                        concessions on the goods of primary interest to developing countries.<note

                            Tokyo September 12–14, 1973, and released the Tokyo Declaration. The
                            declaration outlined the aims for the Tokyo Round of comprehensive,
                            multilateral trade negotiations, which included securing “additional
                            benefits for the international trade” of developing nations. For the

                        examining ways to provide additional consideration for the special needs of
                        developing countries.</p>
                    <p>The United States is willing to consider, with a positive and open attitude,
                        the negotiation on agreements to stabilize commodity prices, including the
                        establishment of a common funding arrangement for fi<pb n="114" facs="0155"
                            xml:id="pg_114"/>nancing buffer stocks where they are a part of
                        individual negotiated agreements.</p>
                    <p>I also believe that the developing countries must acquire fuller
                        participation in the global economic decisionmaking process. Some progress
                        has already been made in this regard by expanding participation of
                        developing countries in the International Monetary Fund.</p>
                    <p>We must use our collective natural resources wisely and constructively. We’ve
                        not always done so. Today our oceans are being plundered and defiled. With a
                        renewed spirit of cooperation and hope, we join in the Conference of the Law
                        of the Sea<note n="12" xml:id="d29fn12">See <ref target="#d24fn5">footnote
                                5, Document 24</ref>.</note> in order to correct past mistakes of
                        generations gone by and to ensure that all nations can share the bounties of
                        the eternal oceans in the future.</p>
                    <p>We must also recognize that the world is facing serious shortages of energy.
                        This is truly a global problem. For our part, we are determined to reduce
                        waste and to work with others toward a fair and proper sharing of the
                        benefits and costs of energy resources.</p>
                    <p>The search for peace and justice also means respect for human dignity. All
                        the signatories of the U.N. Charter have pledged themselves to observe and
                        to respect basic human rights. Thus, no member of the United Nations can
                        claim that mistreatment of its citizens is solely its own business. Equally,
                        no member can avoid its responsibilities to review and to speak when torture
                        or unwarranted deprivation occurs in any part of the world.</p>
                    <p>The basic thrust of human affairs points toward a more universal demand for
                        fundamental human rights. The United States has a historical birthright to
                        be associated with this process.</p>
                    <p>We in the United States accept this responsibility in the fullest and the
                        most constructive sense. Ours is a commitment, and not just a political
                        posture. I know perhaps as well as anyone that our own ideals in the area of
                        human rights have not always been attained in the United States, but the
                        American people have an abiding commitment to the full realization of these
                        ideals. And we are determined, therefore, to deal with our deficiencies
                        quickly and openly. We have nothing to conceal.</p>
                    <p>To demonstrate this commitment, I will seek congressional approval and sign
                        the U.N. covenants on economic, social, and cultural rights, and the
                        covenants on civil and political rights.<note n="13" xml:id="d29fn13">See

                    <p>The United Nations is a global forum dedicated to the peace and well-being of
                        every individual—no matter how weak, no matter how poor. But we have allowed
                        its human rights machinery to be ignored and sometimes politicized. There is
                        much that can be done to strengthen it.</p>
                    <p>The Human Rights Commission should be prepared to meet more often. And all
                        nations should be prepared to offer its fullest cooperation to the Human
                        Rights Commission, to welcome its investigations, to work with its
                        officials, and to act on its reports.</p>
                    <p>I would like to see the entire United Nations Human Rights Division moved
                        back here to the central headquarters, where its activities will be in the
                        forefront of our attention and where the attention of the press corps can
                        stimulate us to deal honestly with this sensitive issue. The proposal made
                        12 years ago by the Government of Costa Rica, to establish a U.N. High
                        Commission[er] for Human Rights, also deserves our renewed attention and our
                            support.<note n="16" xml:id="d29fn16">For information on the 1965

                    <p>Strengthened international machinery will help us to close the gap between
                        promise and performance in protecting human rights. When gross or widespread
                        violation takes place—contrary to international commitments—it is of concern
                        to all. The solemn commitments of the United Nations Charter, of the United

                        security agreements.</p>
                    <p>This issue is important in itself. It should not block progress on other
                        important matters affecting the security and well-being of our people and of
                        world peace. It is obvious that the reduction of tension, the control of
                        nuclear arms, the achievement of harmony in the troubled areas of the world,
                        and the provision of food, good health, and education will independently
                        contribute to advancing the human condition.</p>

                    <p>In our relationships with other countries, these mutual concerns will be
                        reflected in our political, our cultural, and our economic attitudes.</p>
                    <p>These then are our basic priorities as we work with other members to
                        strengthen and to improve the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>First, we will strive for peace in the troubled areas of the world; second,
                        we will aggressively seek to control the weaponry of war; third, we will
                        promote a new system of international economic progress and cooperation; and
                        fourth, we will be steadfast in our dedication to the dignity and well-being
                        of people throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>I believe that this is a foreign policy that is consistent with my own
                        Nation’s historic values and commitments. And I believe that it is a foreign
                        policy that is consonant with the ideals of the United Nations.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Overall Approach</p>
                    <p>The first and longest topic of discussion was the question of <hi
                            rend="italic">how the United States should relate to Latin America.</hi>
                        The participants agreed that the new approach should be based on a
                        recognition of the global nature of the region’s problems, and U.S. policy
                        should be aimed at working with Latin American governments on the
                        North-South economic issues which are of greatest concern to them. At the
                        same time, constructive bilateral relationships should be encouraged.</p>
                    <p>He suggested that the best overall policy may be a non-policy.<note n="2"

                    <p>He then initiated a discussion of whether the U.S. had a special relationship
                        with Latin America or not.</p>
                    <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_TTA_1">Todman</persName> suggested
                        that we drop the rhetoric about a special relationship and deal with Latin
                        America on bilateral, regional, or global levels depending on the issues. In
                        the major economic areas, it is necessary to deal on a global basis and
                        develop a single policy, and this is also the case on nuclear proliferation
                        and immigration. But because of the geographical proximity, Latin America
                        impinges on us more directly than other areas. For example, we share a
                        border with Mexico and that requires special policies. We have certain
                        regional institutions, and they require special policies.</p>
                    <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SAM_1">Anthony Solomon</persName>
                        agreed that we had special problems with respect to Mexico and Brazil, but
                        the question of the special relationship relates to the region rather than
                        to individual countries. He suggested that we would need special policies to
                        these two countries. He said that the arguments <hi rend="italic"
                            >against</hi> an overall special relationship to the region are very
                        powerful.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_KEH_1">Enno Knoche</persName> said that the possible
                        consequences of ending the special relationship would be that it would tend
                        to encourage Latin America to form blocs against the U.S., but he added that
                        since this would not be in Latin America’s long-term interest, he felt such
                        blocs would not endure.</p>
                    <p>Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCW_1">Charles Duncan</persName> said
                        the U.S. has had a special relationship with Latin America, and it still
                        does. General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> agreed, but he
                        said that our special military relationships are eroding, and that we are
                        going to miss them when they are gone. He said that this relationship—for
                        example, the training assistance program for foreign air force
                        personnel—provides an opportunity for us to influence these governments on
                        human rights and other matters.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Intervention</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_TTA_1">Todman</persName> said that this issue aroused
                        the greatest interest and controversy in Latin America where the U.S. has
                        had a long history of intervention—most recently in the Dominican Republic
                        and Chile. Now, we are being accused of intervention on behalf of human
                        rights. The question is: to what extent do we need to intervene?</p>
                    <pb n="119" facs="0160" xml:id="pg_119"/>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DCW_1">Duncan</persName> said that we first needed to
                        define our interests in the hemisphere, and said such a definition would be
                        necessary to decide on the need for a “special relationship.” Then, he
                        prefers the option of “limited intervention.”</p>
                    <p> returned to the question of whether we should have a special policy to Latin
                        America. He said that the notion of a special policy is ahistorical. In the
                        past, it has done nothing more than lock us into a cycle of creating
                        unrealistic expectations and then having to live with the subsequent
                        disappointments. The <persName corresp="#p_MWB_1">Monroe</persName> Doctrine
                        which underlies this approach is no longer valid. It represents an
                        imperialistic legacy which has embittered our relationships.</p>
                    <p>He recommended that if our relationships are to become healthier, then we
                        need to put them on a more normal footing. He said that we can do this by
                        stressing our bilateral relations and in seeing the region’s problems in a
                        global context, as the President said in his <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                            >UN</gloss> speech. And we should use this as a point of departure in
                        the Pan American Day speech. What was needed was a normalization of our
                        relations with Latin America. We did not want another Alliance for
                        Progress.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> said that he agreed with
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s assessment.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> agreed and said that we
                        should put the statement in the context that we have recognized that Latin
                        America had reached adulthood. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                            >Brzezinski</persName> warned, however, that such an approach was also
                        patronizing. Instead, he said that we should encourage Latin America to
                        diversify its relationships with other countries and regions, and that we,
                        in turn, should differentiate our approach to different governments.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_DCW_1">Duncan</persName> agreed that a bilateral
                        approach makes sense, but he said the relevant question on intervention is
                        how should we react to the Soviets in this hemisphere.</p>
                    <p> said that we should not react reflexively; rather we should judge our
                        response in terms of the likely consequences if the U.S. did not intervene.
                        Nevertheless, he does not see a great likelihood of the U.S. intervening in
                        Latin America in response to Soviet probes. He said that individual
                        governments have a good sense of their own independence and therefore our
                        reactions should be contingent on the way the other Latin Americans respond.
                        But we cannot accept a blanket policy for all cases. Later, he said, and
                            <persName corresp="#p_SAM_1">Solomon</persName> agreed, that a statement
                        on nonintervention might be misinterpreted.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SL_2">Leon Sloss</persName> of <gloss
                            target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> said that he agreed with Brzezinsk’s
                        emphasis on a global and a bilateral approach, but he said that we should
                        not discourage some regional institutions which have potential to contribute
                        to the solution of certain problems—for example in arms control areas.</p>
                    <pb n="120" facs="0161" xml:id="pg_120"/>
                    <p> agreed that we should not discourage regional institutions, but he suggested
                        that the healthiest approach would be a hands-off one, where the Latin
                        Americans would approach us—instead of we, them—to pay attention to the
                        regional institutions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SAM_1">Solomon</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> agreed that the President
                        should redefine our relationship rather than renounce it. <persName
                            corresp="#p_SAM_1">Solomon</persName> said that the only viable regional
                        economic institution was the Inter-American Development Bank, and a sign of
                        its relative importance is the fact that Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_BWM_1">Blumenthal</persName> will attend its annual
                        ministerial meeting whereas he would not attend the one at the Asian

                        relationships—bringing on donors from Europe and Japan—although we are still
                        the biggest contributor. But in trade or aid, it is hard to see a special
                        relationship.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">David Aaron</persName> pressed the issue of the
                        special relationship a couple of steps further. One implication of a change
                        in strategy would involve a shift in the distribution of U.S. resources
                        abroad. Secondly, he noted that there was, in fact, a collective
                        consciousness in Latin America.</p>
                    <p> said that we should not deceive ourselves. The consciousness is only
                        collective when it is negative and in opposition to the U.S. Constructive
                        relations demand greater specificity.</p>
                    <p>—In ideology, we want to show an affinity for democratic states.</p>
                    <p>—Security considerations demand that we recognize the geopolitical importance
                        of Brazil and perhaps the special importance of the Caribbean to the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>—Economically, we need a more diversified strategy.</p>
                    <p>However, <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said we should
                        not try to package these clusters of interests into a single policy.</p>

                        issue. He suggested that we adjust our relations so as to differentiate
                        according to the kind of regime: warm relations with civilian and democratic
                        governments, normal relations with nonrepressive military regimes, and cool
                        but correct relations with repressive governments.</p>
                    <p> agreed, noting that Brazil was not so repressive as is commonly thought.

                        same in Latin America as in Africa or Asia. Given the special constituencies
                        in the U.S., that would not be easy. We will have to go out of our way to do
                        that.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> said that it was very
                        important for us to stay committed on our policy on human rights, but at the

                        <persName corresp="#p_SAM_1">Solomon</persName> said that we should work
                        with Congress to make clear why they should not be thinking about a Latin
                        American policy on human rights. He and <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"
                            >Christopher</persName> agreed on the need to obtain more discretionary
                        authority and make more relevant distinctions in the application of our
                        policy. If we define gross violations as torture or degrading treatment,
                        instead of denial of due process, then we only single out seven–ten
                        countries rather than 60–80. Then, we can have some impact.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_TTA_1">Todman</persName> said that we should look at
                        aid as a way to improve human rights conditions in very poor countries. For
                        example in countries like Haiti, violations of human rights occur often
                        because of impoverished conditions, and it does not make much sense for us
                        to cut off aid in these circumstances.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1">Christopher</persName> asked whether the United
                        States, as a declining source of arms to Latin America, is justified in
                        adopting a special policy on arms transfers to Latin America.</p>
                    <p>General <persName corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName> reminded everyone that
                        in the early <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> years we tried
                        to get Latin American governments to shift defense expenditures to
                        nation-building, but as sovereign states, they just turned to other sources
                        to buy arms. As long as they are going to buy, he preferred that they buy
                        from us rather than the Russians.</p>

                            >Todman</persName> answered that he would eliminate the Permanent
                        Council and reduce the U.S. contribution, but we should do so after
                        consulting with the Latin Americans.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_SAM_1">Solomon</persName> said that in his experience
                        in State and in <gloss target="#t_ARA_1">ARA</gloss>, every Administration
                        had tried to strengthen the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> and tried
                        to make it more efficient, by cutting personnel and reorganization. The
                        trouble is that the Latin Americans are very sensitive to their “perks,” and
                        they perceived every effort to strengthen the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1"
                            >OAS</gloss> as an attempt to weaken it. He concluded that the <gloss
                            target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> was useless, and there was nothing that
                        could be done.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_ADL_1">David Aaron</persName> said that if we want to
                        follow the global approach to its logical conclusion, then our involvement
                        in the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>, which once played the role of a
                            mini-<gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, should be phased out. We really
                        do not need it any longer. We should say we want to deal with Latin America
                        like other regions.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_SAM_1">Solomon</persName> acknowledged that that would
                        indeed be perceived as the end to the special relationship, but noted that
                        before doing that, we should look at the political ramifications and the
                        domestic reaction, which he predicted would be negative. In conversations he
                        has had with Latin American leaders, they all acknowledged privately that it
                        was a worthless organization, but at the same time, they were horrified at
                        the prospect of its being abolished. But he did not see anything we could
                        do.</p>
                    <p>In fact, Latin Americans use the global North-South forum more and even take
                        the <gloss target="#t_SELA_1">SELA</gloss> more seriously than they do the

                        not die a natural death. Whenever it looks like it will, somebody turns the

                        </hi> first wanted to thank the General Secretary for the frankness and
                        openness with which he had addressed the various important questions before
                        us. He, too, would try to speak frankly and openly, because he believed this
                        to be the best way of achieving results. First, before beginning to set
                        forth the views of the United States regarding the relations between our two
                        countries, the Secretary wanted to transmit to Mr. Brezhnev a letter from
                        President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>.<note n="2"

                    </p>
                    <p>(Brezhnev took a few minutes to read the translation of the President’s
                        letter and passed it on to Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1"
                            >Gromyko</persName>).</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that all of us were heartened by Brezhnev’s foreign policy
                        remarks in his recent speeches. Last winter, as Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> prepared to assume the presidency,
                        he had been impressed and gratified by Brezhnev’s public statement on the
                        importance of good relations between our two countries. In particular, he
                        was encouraged by <pb n="125" facs="0166" xml:id="pg_125"/>Brezhnev’s
                        statement at Tula that detente meant a willingness to resolve differences
                        and disputes by peaceful means, at conference tables.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d31fn3">See <ref target="#d17fn3">footnote 3, Document
                            17</ref>.</note> The President’s deep conviction, which the Secretary
                        shared and, in his judgment, was shared by a majority of the American
                        people, was that our two countries must do everything they could to reduce
                        the danger of war. The President, like Brezhnev, was a practical man and
                        realized that the overall state of our relations would be determined largely
                        by the specifics of the issues on our agenda. These were the “objective
                        realities” of detente which determined where we were going.</p>
                    <p>The President, like Brezhnev, had been an officer in the armed forces of his
                        country, and had a deep determination to do all he could to work toward a
                        reasonable and fair regulation of military competition.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary well knew that Brezhnev had lived through the devastation of
                        war, and knew the sorrow and suffering it would bring to all of our people,
                        the young and the old. The Secretary, too, had experienced the horrors of
                        war, had seen his friends and comrades die, and had lived with the
                        responsibility for nuclear weapons for many years. It was his fervent hope
                        that our children and Brezhnev’s children would be spared the incalculable
                        horror of a nuclear holocaust. At this point <hi rend="italic">Brezhnev</hi>
                        interrupted to tell a story in connection with alleged Soviet intentions to
                        attack or threaten the United States. An Oriental tale related that at a
                        bazaar a man had purposely started the rumor that at the far end of that
                        bazaar someone was giving away pillows free of charge. As people heard him,
                        they began running toward that part of the bazaar, until the man was left
                        all alone. At that moment he began to wonder whether there might not be
                        something to the rumor that he himself had started, and he thought that,
                        just in case, he, too, should start running; who knows, maybe they were
                        indeed giving out free pillows. Brezhnev said he knew that Americans liked
                        anecdotes, and that is why he told this story by way of an analogy to those
                        who started rumors about Soviet-war-like intentions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> continued by saying that recently,
                        Brezhnev had noted that there were objective possibilities for developing
                        equal and mutually advantageous cooperation in various spheres for the good
                        of both countries and universal peace. He heartily agreed with such a view
                        of the situation.</p>
                    <p>Brezhnev had further said that the question was how soon such a development
                        would begin. He was firmly convinced that we could begin that process now.
                        We had an unparalleled opportunity to set our relations on a fresh
                        course.</p>
                    <pb n="126" facs="0167" xml:id="pg_126"/>
                    <p>At Tula Brezhnev had also said that detente meant an ability to take into
                        consideration each other’s legitimate interests. The two sides were
                        realistic enough to know that we would have differences. But we shared a
                        fundamental interest in improving our mutual understanding. Our differences
                        must not distract us from working for peace. They also must not divide
                        us.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary wanted to give Brezhnev a sense of developments in our country
                        which had affected our national outlook. We have come through a hotly
                        contested national election which was a process of renewal and of developing
                        a new policy consensus in the country. Now a new government had taken office
                        in Washington, but we were dealing with the same currents of opinion that
                        had shaped our election debates. There was support for detente among the
                        American people, but there were also concerns and apprehensions which had to
                        be overcome.</p>
                    <p>At this point <hi rend="italic">Brezhnev</hi> interrupted again and recalled
                        how at the very beginning of the “Great Patriotic War”, at the time Hitler
                        had attacked Czechoslovakia and had allied himself with Mussolini, he had
                        come home from work one day to the place where he lived in rather humble
                        conditions together with his father. His father was a simple man, a steel
                        worker, and this story, which Brezhnev was sure his colleagues on the
                        Politburo had heard more than once, was well-suited to illustrate a simple
                        working man’s approach to the psychological questions of war. His father had
                        asked him “Lyonya, which is the highest mountain in the world”? He had
                        responded that it was Mt. Everest. His father then asked how tall was the
                        Eiffel Tower in Paris? He had replied that it was some 300 meters tall. His
                        father then said that if he and his friends had been authorized to do so,
                        they would have built a tower twice as tall as the Eiffel Tower, would have
                        hauled it up to Mt. Everest and topped it off with a gallows. There they
                        would hang Hitler, and would instruct everybody to view this scene through a
                        telescope. His father was obviously unaware of the fact that the curvature
                        of the earth would make such viewing impossible. His father went on to say
                        they would then declare that this would be the fate of not only the first
                        instigator of war, but of any other war-monger. After hanging five, six, or
                        seven such criminals the world would be rid of war. Much later, during the
                        Nuremberg Trial, when the prosecutor there pronounced the words “instigator
                        of War”, Brezhnev recalled this heart-to-heart conversation between a father
                        and a son. It was a true story and, while Brezhnev apologized for having
                        interrupted, he felt it was a useful story, because it emphasized the need
                        to defend peace.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The Secretary</hi> acknowledged that it was indeed a very
                        useful story. He continued by saying that President <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> enjoyed the support of <pb n="127"
                            facs="0168" xml:id="pg_127"/>the vast majority of the American
                        people—more so than any President for many years—and therefore he could get
                        support for arms control agreements. The point he wanted to make was of
                        critical importance, because it meant that any agreements we could reach
                        here the President could get ratified by Congress.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that what we wanted to set in motion during our talks was
                        a process of improvement in key arms control issues, in our bilateral
                        relations, and in international relations. The President had spoken of his
                        belief that we were all here in good faith to pursue a more stable peace
                        through new arms limitation negotiations. He felt that we must be bold and
                        vigorous in achieving control over nuclear weapons. We were prepared to go
                        far in this joint endeavor and explore new ideas. The positions the
                        President advocated were an advance over the past—not only in the strategic
                        arms area, but in stopping all nuclear testing, and moving ahead on a broad
                        range of other arms control issues.</p>
                    <p>Our present talks were a crucial step in demonstrating that detente was a
                        dynamic, long-term process. It was not static. We, like the Soviet Union,
                        must give it new meaning, if it were truly to reflect greater mutual
                        understanding. The Secretary would suggest that we begin regeneration of
                        detente.</p>
                    <p>Without going into details now, the Secretary wanted to sketch out those
                        areas which we would want to explore with the Soviet side. We will explore
                        ways to address the <gloss target="#t_Backfire_1">Backfire</gloss> and
                        Cruise missile issues, we will make a comprehensive proposal which would
                        enhance strategic stability and mutual confidence, we will discuss advance
                        notification of missile test firings, averting military competition in
                        space, and concerns that certain forms of civil defense can be
                        destabilizing. We also hoped that our discussions will make a turning point
                        in the long effort to achieve a total cessation of nuclear testing, a
                        subject in which, the Secretary knew, the Soviet Union had deep concerns.
                        Conditions may be right for the United States and the Soviet Union to
                        exercise unique leadership in getting this process moving. We were moving
                        promptly to secure Congressional ratification of the Treaty on the Threshold
                        Test Ban and the Treaty on Peaceful Nuclear Explosions.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d31fn4">On July 3, 1974, <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                                >Nixon</persName> and Brezhnev signed the Treaty on the Limitation
                            of Underground Nuclear Weapons Tests, also known as the Threshold Test
                            Ban Treaty (<gloss target="#t_TTBT_1">TTBT</gloss>),which prohibited
                            underground nuclear tests above a 150 <gloss target="#t_KT_1">KT</gloss>
                            limit. On May 28, 1976, <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> and
                            Brezhnev signed the Treaty on Underground Nuclear Explosions for
                            Peaceful Purposes (<gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>), which extended
                            the limitations of the <gloss target="#t_TTBT_1">TTBT</gloss> to
                            underground tests for peaceful purposes.</note> What we accomplish
                        during our meetings here would help us in the ratification of <pb n="128"
                            facs="0169" xml:id="pg_128"/>those treaties. Another area where we could
                        work together to move forward was the Indian Ocean. We wanted to explore
                        Soviet interest in mutual restraint in that area.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary pointed out that conventional arms exports were dangerous and
                        wasted vast and increasingly scarce resources. Our two countries have
                        accounted for a large proportion of such trade. In fact, the United States
                        occupied first place in the export trade of conventional arms, and the
                        Soviet Union second place. Competition between us in the export of arms
                        placed stress on our bilateral relations. It should in any event be a matter
                        of principle for advanced countries to make a serious effort to restrain and
                        reduce this trade. We would welcome an expression of interest on the part of
                        the Soviet side in an exchange of views on this subject. In this connection,
                        we believed that the best way to begin was with suppliers. The United States
                        was ready to exercise restraint in its own activities. We would be talking
                        to our allies. The President was interested in Soviet views on prospects for
                        cooperation. In the area of non-proliferation we were gratified by progress
                        in the London Suppliers’ Group,<note n="5" xml:id="d31fn5">The Nuclear
                            Suppliers Group (<gloss target="#t_NSG_1">NSG</gloss>), also known as
                            the London Suppliers’ Group, was established following the 1974 Indian
                            nuclear test. Members included the United States, the Soviet Union, the
                            United Kingdom, Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, and
                            Japan. A series of meetings in London between 1974 and 1977 resulted in
                            agreements that set guidelines for the export of nuclear materials,
                            equipment, and technology.</note> and in particular with very solid
                        Soviet participation. These were important problems, and we hoped to
                        continue in close cooperation.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary wanted to inform Brezhnev today that in the very near future we
                        would announce certain policy decisions concerning nuclear
                        non-proliferation. They will include the indefinite deferral of commercial
                        reprocessing and recycling of plutonium in the United States, and the
                        restructuring of the U.S. breeder reactor program to emphasize designs other
                        than the plutonium breeder. The Secretary had instructed our Embassy to
                        inform Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> in detail of
                        these policy decisions. We shared Soviet concern about the dangers of
                        proliferation of nuclear weapons, and we believed that the actions which we
                        are about to take would constitute a major step forward toward this end.</p>
                    <p>We had reviewed the Vienna <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss>
                        negotiations and our <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> policy. The
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> Administration strongly
                        supported these negotiations. A satisfactory agreement could enhance the
                        security of both sides equally. The West had shown its will to move toward
                        agreement. The December 1975 Western proposal to reduce U.S. nuclear weapons
                        was <pb n="129" facs="0170" xml:id="pg_129"/>a substantial step.<note n="6"

                    <p>After two months in office, let me give you a highly subjective assessment of
                        where we stand with our foreign policy:</p>
                    <p>The public clearly understands that the <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> foreign policy is derived from an affirmative
                        commitment to certain basic human values. Moreover, you have defined these
                        values as “human rights,” which is both broader and more flexible than such
                        words as “liberty” or “freedom.” This gives our foreign policy a wider
                        appeal, more in tune with the emerging political consciousness of
                        mankind—which is concerned both with liberty and equity.</p>
                    <p>Starting from that moral base, your basic priorities for our foreign policy,
                        both in terms of actual substance and specific focus, are co<pb n="130"
                            facs="0171" xml:id="pg_130"/>herent and consistent: (1) we will seek to
                        coordinate more closely with our principal allies in order to provide the
                        foundation for a more stable international system; (2) we will engage in a
                        North-South dialogue in order to deal with wider human needs; (3) we will
                        seek accommodation on the East-West front in order to avoid war and to widen
                        trans-ideological cooperation. In addition, we will seek to halt the spread
                        of arms, both conventional and nuclear.</p>
                    <p>The record is more mixed, in my judgment, when we look at more specific
                        aspects of this broad policy:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe</p>
                    <p>Here I think we have done very well. Our commitment to human rights has put
                        the Soviet leadership on the defensive in an area where it had a free ride
                        for at least the last eight years, and perhaps even for the last fifteen—if
                        we count from the start of the Vietnamese War. The reason that Brezhnev et
                        al are reacting so strongly to your insistence on human rights is not
                        because they fear that we will make human rights a condition for our
                        relations with them; they fear this insistence because they know that human
                        rights is a compelling idea, and that associating America with this idea not
                        only strengthens us, but it also generates pressures from within their own
                        system. Ideologically they are thus on the defensive.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, with regards to <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, by
                        committing ourselves to reductions, we have made the Soviets seem opposed to
                        genuine arms limitations. In the past, they have often made the United
                        States look as if it was opposed to arms limitations. The tables have now
                        been turned, though the chance for a comprehensive agreement this summer are
                        very uncertain.</p>
                    <p>The next step should be this: we should ask the Soviets to explain what
                        specifically they did not like about the package, thus drawing them into a
                        discussion of it.</p>

                    <p>Your basic statement has created a flexible framework for dealing with

                                <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> responded that the
                            “first prerequisite” of a lasting peace was the recognition of Israel by
                            its neighbors; second, the establishment of permanent borders for
                            Israel; and third, the establishment of a homeland for Palestinian
                            refugees “who have suffered for many, many years.” (<hi rend="italic"

                        changes but transitional security arrangements and with a homeland for the
                        Palestinians, and by doing so publicly you have made a real breakthrough.
                        The need is now for the parties concerned to understand that we are
                        committed to these basic principles and that they provide the point of
                        departure for more substantive negotiations among themselves. Again, this is
                        a significant step forward from almost everything that the United States has
                        said on the subject for at least ten to fifteen years, but persistence on
                        our part will be required.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Latin America</p>
                    <p>We are still shaping our basic approach, but I am hopeful. I use the word
                        “approach” advisedly; it will not be a new policy, something which every new
                        Administration has tended proudly to proclaim—and then forget. Instead of
                        focusing on Latin America as something special, to be protected by the
                            <persName corresp="#p_MWB_1">Monroe</persName> Doctrine (which most
                        Latin Americans resent) you are moving towards an approach which stresses
                        bilateral relations, of various types, with individual Latin American
                        states, and which deals with their broader problems in a wider global
                        context. I believe this is responsive to their pride and to their needs.</p>
                    <p>The major cloud is the deterioration in our relationship with Brazil,
                        something which ought to be repaired, given Brazil’s present and potential
                        role in the Western Hemisphere. Brazil is an emerging superpower and it is
                        clearly in the U.S. interest to have it on our side. It can be a source of
                        stability and influence not only in regard to Latin America but even in
                        regard to Africa, in which it is likely to become increasingly engaged.</p>

                        consultations might help to relieve this irritant, while the forthcoming
                        summit should provide us with the opportunity for an affirmative
                        recommitment to basic unity among the trilateral countries.</p>
                    <p>I should note, however, that our human rights policy has evoked rather mixed
                        feelings in Western Europe. This is not surprising, given West European
                        political traditions and their proximity to the Soviets, but for some
                        Europeans—especially the Germans—it is a source of concern.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">China</p>
                    <p>Our policy towards China is yet to unfold and it needs to be unfolded.
                        Nonetheless, Soviet efforts to promote Sino-Soviet normalization and/or
                        reconciliation have so far failed. This gives us the needed time to develop
                        the required initiatives, though these should be forthcoming in the course
                        of the spring, lest the Chinese begin to think that we ignore them or take
                        them for granted. I will be making some concrete proposals soon.</p>

                        pessimistic, such an improvement—at least in the short run—is highly
                        desirable.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Africa</p>
                    <p>It is a morass. Current African events can be seen in terms of two broad
                        interpretations, both of them probably right but each yielding a
                        contradictory conclusion. The first is that Africa is in the midst of a
                        social-political upheaval, with post-colonial structures simply collaps<pb
                            n="133" facs="0174" xml:id="pg_133"/>ing. In that case, it is clearly
                        inadvisable for the U.S. to become involved. On the other hand, events in
                        Africa can also be seen as part of a broad East-West struggle, with
                        pro-Western regimes being challenged by the pro-Soviet regimes. This
                        dictates resistance to Soviet efforts. Both interpretations are probably
                        right, and they point to the conclusion (in my mind) that we should press
                        the Soviets to desist but do so outside of Africa, through diplomatic
                        leverage, trade denial, etc., but not through direct involvement in Africa
                        per se. In the meantime, the situation remains grave and it is possible that
                        pro-Soviet developments in Ethiopia may soon be matched by a collapse of the
                        pro-Western government in Zaire. This, together with the likelihood of very
                        little progress in Southern Africa, portends a rather dark future.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Defense</p>
                    <p>Our basic position is strong, and a comprehensive reassessment of our force
                        posture and fundamental strategic concepts is now under way. Under <persName
                            corresp="#p_BGS_1">Brown</persName>’s direction, I feel quite confident
                        that by late summer we will be well under way towards a renovated and
                        relevant strategic doctrine. However, in the conventional field and in
                        long-range rapid strike capabilities much remains to be done, and <gloss

                        much as it should.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">North-South Relations</p>
                    <p>We are yet to define our basic position. You made a good start in your <gloss

                        strategy is yet to be shaped. I think it is quite clear that on this issue
                        there will be major divisions within the Cabinet, and probably a tough fight
                        in Congress. However, if one looks ten or twenty years ahead, it is clear
                        that the United States needs desperately to fashion a comprehensive and
                        long-term North-South strategy. Such a strategy is an essential component of
                        your wider architectural effort.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">International Economics</p>
                    <p>The Summit will be vital in this respect, especially with protectionism
                        becoming increasingly appealing.<note n="8" xml:id="d32fn8">See <ref

                            would focus the President’s attention “on what needs to be done to give
                            greater meaning to the ’architectural’ notion with which your foreign
                            policy has been associated.” He continued: “The forthcoming summit will
                            be an important test. Without some broader initiatives, the Summit may
                            not live up to expectations no matter how much we seek to deepen them.
                            The main reason our allies wanted the Summit is because they are
                            concerned that the public—particularly in Europe—has lost faith in the
                            liberal democratic political and economic system that has provided both
                            prosperity and social stability. The purpose of the Summit is both to
                            reaffirm our collective faith in that system and to take concrete steps
                            to demonstrate its viability. As of next week we will be concentrating
                            on this issue.” (Carter Library, National Security Affairs, Brzezinski

                        my wife and I had brought back from our visits to several of the American
                        States. I spoke particularly for the need for constant cooperation,
                        consultation, and harmony among the nations of this hemisphere. I believe
                        that just as strongly today as President of the United States as I did 3
                        years ago as Governor of Georgia.</p>
                    <p>I am delighted to be with you in this beautiful House of the Americas. For
                        nearly three decades the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> has stood for

                        nations, for peace, and the rule of law in this hemisphere. The <gloss
                            target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> Charter pledges us to individual liberty
                        and social justice. I come here now to restate our own commitment to these
                        goals.</p>
                    <p>The challenge before us today, however, is not just to reaffirm those
                        principles but to find ways to make them a reality. To do this, we must take
                        account of the changes in our relationships that have taken place over the
                        last 10 years, and we must candidly acknowledge the differences that exist
                        among us. We must adapt our current policies and institutions to those
                        changes so that we can pursue our goals more effectively.</p>
                    <p>As nations of the New World, we once believed that we could prosper in
                        isolation from the Old World. But since the Second World War, in particular,
                        all of us have taken such vital roles in the world community that isolation
                        would now be harmful to our own best interests and to other countries. Our
                        joining in the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the General
                        Agreement on Trade and Tariffs are all signs that we understand this. So is
                        the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development which Raul Prebisch
                        of Argentina made into an important forum of the developing world. Venezuela
                        is now cochairing the Paris Conference on International Economic
                        Cooperation. The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America is a
                        source of many creative ideas on development throughout the world. The
                        leaders of many Latin American nations have been the driving force behind
                        improving North-South negotiations.</p>
                    <p>In all these ways, the nations of Latin America were among the first in our
                        changing world to see the importance of adapting global institutions to the
                        new realities of our day.</p>
                    <p>The problems and the promises of our region have become as diverse as the
                        world itself. The economies of most Latin American nations have been
                        developing rapidly, although, of course, at different rates. Some have an
                        impressive rate of growth. Some—a few are among the poorest in the
                        developing world. Some have abundant energy resources; others are
                        desperately short of energy. Some of our countries export primary products
                        only. Some have become major exporters of advanced manufactured goods while
                        others export little at all. Your problems of market access, technology
                        transfer, and debt management sometimes defy regional solutions.</p>
                    <p>In addition to economic diversity, we have all developed widely varied forms
                        and philosophies of government. This diversity has brought national pride
                        and national strength. And as you’ve played more independent and important
                        roles in world politics, we have all begun to construct more normal and more
                        balanced and more equal relationships.</p>
                    <pb n="136" facs="0177" xml:id="pg_136"/>
                    <p>In the light of these changes, a single United States policy toward Latin
                        America and the Caribbean makes little sense. What we need is a wider and a
                        more flexible approach, worked out in close consultation with you. Together,
                        we will develop policies more suited to each nation’s variety and potential.
                        In this process, I will be particularly concerned that we not seek to divide
                        the nations of Latin America one from another or to set Latin America apart
                        from the rest of the world. Our own goal is to address problems in a way
                        which will lead to productive solutions—globally, regionally, and
                        bilaterally.</p>
                    <p>Our new approach will be based on three basic elements:</p>
                    <p>First of all is a high regard for the individuality and the sovereignty of
                        each Latin American and Caribbean nation. We will not act abroad in ways
                        that we would not tolerate at home in our own country.</p>
                    <p>Second is our respect for human rights, a respect which is also so much a
                        part of your own tradition. Our values and yours require us to combat abuses
                        of individual freedom, including those caused by political, social, and
                        economic injustice. Our own concern for these values will naturally
                        influence our relations with the countries of this hemisphere and throughout
                        the world. You will find this country, the United States of America, eager
                        to stand beside those nations which respect human rights and which promote
                        democratic ideals.</p>
                    <p>Third is our desire to press forward on the great issues which affect the
                        relations between the developed and the developing nations. Your economic
                        problems are also global in character and cannot be dealt with solely on
                        regional terms.</p>
                    <p>However, some of our own global policies are of particular interest to other
                        American States. When major decisions are made in these areas, we will
                        consult with you.</p>
                    <p>The United States will take a positive and an open attitude toward the
                        negotiation of agreements to stabilize commodity prices, including the
                        establishment of a common funding arrangement for financing buffer stocks
                        where they are a part of individual and negotiated agreements.</p>
                    <p>We will actively pursue the multilateral trade negotiations with your
                        governments in Geneva, Switzerland. We are committed to minimize trade
                        restrictions and to take into account the specific trade problems of
                        developing countries and to provide special and more favorable treatment
                        where feasible and appropriate. We believe that this is in our mutual
                        interest and that it will create important new opportunities for Latin
                        American trade.</p>
                    <p>Our own science and technology can be useful to many of your countries. For
                        instance, we are ready to train your technicians to use more information
                        gathered by our own satellites, so that you can make <pb n="137" facs="0178"
                            xml:id="pg_137"/>better judgments on management of your resources and
                        your environment. Space communications technology can also be a creative
                        tool in helping your national television systems to promote your educational
                        and cultural objectives.</p>
                    <p>I have asked Congress to meet in full our pledges to the Inter-American
                        Development Bank and the other multilateral lending institutions which loan
                        a high proportion of their capital to the relatively advanced developing
                        countries of Latin America.</p>
                    <p>And finally, we are directing more and more of our bilateral economic
                        assistance to the poorer countries. We are also prepared to explore with
                        other nations new ways of being helpful on a wide range of institutional,
                        human development, and technological approaches which might enable them to
                        deal more effectively with the problems of the needy. All of us have a
                        special responsibility to help the poorest countries in the world as well as
                        the poorest people in each of our countries.</p>
                    <p>I would like to add a word about private investment. Your governments are
                        understandably interested in setting rules that will encourage private
                        investors to play an important role in your development. We support your
                        efforts and recognize that a new flexibility and adaptability are required
                        today for foreign investment to be most useful in combining technology,
                        capital management, and market experience to meet your development needs. We
                        will do our part in this field to avoid differences and misunderstandings
                        between your government and ours.</p>
                    <p>One of the most significant political trends of our time is the relationship
                        between the developing nations of the world and the industrialized
                        countries. We benefit from your advice and counsel, and we count on you to
                        contribute your constructive leadership and help guide us in this
                        North-South dialog.</p>
                    <p>We also hope to work with all nations to halt the spread of nuclear explosive
                        capabilities. The States of Latin America took the initiative 10 years ago
                        when you set up the first nuclear-free zone in any populated area of the
                        world. The Treaty of Tlatelolco is a model worthy of our own
                            admiration.<note n="4" xml:id="d33fn4">The 1967 Treaty of Tlatelolco
                            (also known as the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in
                            Latin America and the Caribbean), which prohibited and prevented the
                            development, testing, use, or manufacture of nuclear weapons, contained
                            two protocols. Protocol I committed countries outside of the treaty zone
                            to undertake obligations of the treaty with respect to their territories
                            within the zone. Protocol II, which Vice President <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHH_1">Humphrey</persName> signed on behalf of the
                            United States on April 1, 1968, called upon states possessing nuclear
                            weapons to agree to respect the obligations in the Treaty to not use
                            nuclear weapons against the parties to the Treaty. The United States
                            became a party to Protocol II in 1971. For additional information, see

                    </p>
                    <p>However, banning the spread of nuclear explosives does not require giving up
                        the benefits of peaceful nuclear technology. We mean to work closely with
                        all of you on new technologies to use the atom for peaceful purposes.</p>
                    <p>To slow the costly buildup of conventional arms, we are seeking global
                        policies of restraint. We are showing restraint in our own policies around
                        the world, and we will be talking to supplier nations and to prospective
                        buyers about ways to work out a common approach. We also believe that
                        regional agreements among producers and purchasers of arms can further such
                        a global effort.</p>
                    <p>I spent most of this morning working on a new United States policy to reduce
                        the sale of conventional arms around the world. Again, you in Latin America
                        have taken the lead. The pledge of eight South American nations to limit the
                        acquisition of offensive arms in their region is a striking example. If the
                        eight nations can implement their pledge, their own people will not be the
                        only ones to benefit. They will have set a standard for others throughout
                        the world to follow.</p>
                    <p>These are challenges that face us in the future. There are also problems that
                        plague us from the past. And we must work together to solve them.</p>
                    <p>One that addresses itself to us is the Panama Canal. In the first days of my
                        own administration, just a few weeks ago, I directed a new approach to our
                        negotiations with Panama on a new Canal treaty. In the light of the changes
                        which I discussed before, the Treaty of 1903,<note n="6" xml:id="d33fn6"
                            >Reference is the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty, signed by officials of the
                            United States and Panama on November 18, 1903.</note> which combines
                        [defines] our relationship with Panama on the canal, is no longer
                        appropriate or effective.</p>
                    <p>I am firmly committed to negotiating in as timely a fashion as possible a new
                        treaty which will take into account Panama’s legitimate needs as a sovereign
                        nation and our own interests and yours in the efficient operation of a
                        neutral canal, open on a nondiscriminatory basis to all users.</p>
                    <p>Another problem which we must in a way address together is that of Cuba. We
                        believe that normal conduct of international affairs and particularly the
                        negotiation of differences require communication with all countries in the
                        world. To these ends, we are seeking to determine <pb n="139" facs="0180"
                            xml:id="pg_139"/>whether relations with Cuba can be improved on a
                        measured and a reciprocal basis.</p>
                    <p>I am dedicated to freedom of movement between nations. I have removed
                        restrictions on United States citizens who want to travel abroad.<note n="7"
                            xml:id="d33fn7">See <ref target="#d29fn15">footnote 15, Document
                                29</ref>.</note> Today there are no restrictions imposed by our
                        country. Today I have also removed similar travel restrictions on resident
                        aliens in the United States.</p>
                    <p>We seek to encourage international travel, and we must take greater account
                        of problems that transcend national borders. Drugs and international crime,
                        including terrorism, challenge traditional concepts of diplomacy. For the
                        well-being of our peoples, we must cooperate on these issues. With each
                        passing year they will occupy a more and more central place in our
                        deliberations.</p>
                    <p>I have a longstanding interest in the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>,
                        and I very much want to see it play an increasingly constructive role.</p>
                    <p>The General Assembly of the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss> has been an
                        important forum for the direct exchange of views among our governments. Such
                        ministerial consultations are extremely useful. They allow us to apply our
                        own collective strength to political and economic problems.</p>
                    <p>The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has performed valuable
                        services. It deserves increased support from all our governments. We believe
                        deeply in the preservation and the enhancement of human rights, and the
                        United States will work toward coordinated and multilateral action in this
                        field. The United States will sign, and I will seek Senate approval of, the

                            of Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Venezuela joined the
                            Andean Pact in 1973.</note> They are the first steps toward Bolívar’s

                    <p>Let me conclude by bringing up a matter that is particularly close to me
                        because of my long interest in inter-American affairs. My wife and I have
                        traveled and made many friends in Mexico and Brazil, the two largest and
                        most rapidly changing countries in Latin America. And we have traveled
                        elsewhere and made many friends in Central and South America. My wife is
                        presently studying Spanish, along with the wife of the Secretary of
                            State,<note n="10" xml:id="d33fn10">Grace <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                                >Vance</persName>.</note> and I have tried to keep up with my own
                        Spanish that I learned at school. I have seen clearly how greatly our
                        country has been blessed and enriched by the people and cultures of the
                        Caribbean and Latin America. And we are bound together—and I see it very
                        clearly—in culture, history, and by common purposes and ideals.</p>
                    <p>The United States actually has the fourth largest Spanish-speaking population
                        in the world. I tried to meet many of them during my campaign the last 2
                        years. And they gave me their support and their encouragement and their
                        advice. The novels we read, the music we hear, the sports that we play—all
                        reflect a growing consciousness of each other.</p>
                    <p>These intellectual, social, cultural, and educational exchanges will
                        continue, either with or without government help. But there are steps that
                        governments can take to speed up and enhance this process. In the months
                        ahead, therefore, we plan to explore with your governments—individually and
                        here in the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>—new people-to-people

                        professional and scientific exchanges, and other ways of strengthening the
                        ties that already link us.</p>
                    <p>The challenge we face is to awake our institutions to a changing world. We
                        must focus our attention on the problems which face our countries and tailor
                        each solution to its problem.</p>
                    <p>As you know, I am a new President. I’ve got a lot to learn. My heart and my
                        interest to a major degree is in Latin America. I welcome every opportunity
                        to strengthen the ties of friendship and a sense of common purpose and close
                        consultation with the nations and the peoples of the Caribbean and Latin
                        America.</p>
                    <p>Many of you are leaders representing your own governments. I ask for your
                        advice and your counsel and your support as we face problems together in the
                        future. This means a lot to our country, and it means a lot to us also to
                        have intimate bilateral and direct relationships with you.</p>
                    <p>We look on the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>, headquartered thankfully
                        here in Washington, as a channel through which we might learn more and
                        receive advice and make plans for the future.</p>
                    <p>Simón Bolívar believed that we would reach our goals only with our peoples
                        free and our governments working in harmony. I hope that the steps that I
                        have outlined today and the commitments that I have made will move us toward
                        those goals of peace and freedom.</p>

                    <p>As I signaled to you, some elements in Congress are seizing on human rights
                        as an excuse for blocking constructive initiatives in the area of
                        development aid or at least as an opportunity for attaching all sorts of
                        restrictive conditions on such aid.<note n="2" xml:id="d34fn2">Presumable

                        concern as excessively rigid and moralistic.</p>
                    <p>Despite this, I believe that our affirmative commitment to human rights is
                        not only morally justified but is in keeping with historical trends, thereby
                        giving American foreign policy additional influence and associating America
                        as a society with a vital human concern. Otherwise, America runs the risk of
                        being perceived only as a consumption-oriented society, making us the focus
                        both of envy and of resentment.</p>
                    <p>However, the point to stress is that human rights is <hi rend="italic">a
                            broad concept.</hi> These two words should mean much more than just
                        political liberty, the right to vote, and protection against arbitrary
                        governmental action. Human rights, and this we should stress, means also
                        certain basic minimum standards of social and economic existence. In effect,
                        human rights refers to all three (political, social, and economic) and this
                        is why these words have such universal appeal.</p>
                    <p>Such a broader, and more flexible definition would have several advantages:
                        it would retain for us the desirable identification with a human cause whose
                        time has come, and yet it would avoid some of the rigidities that are
                        potential in the narrower political definition. It would give us the freedom
                        to point at the most glaring abuses (e.g., political suppression in some
                        countries, or total social indifference in others), <pb n="143" facs="0184"
                            xml:id="pg_143"/>though leaving us the necessary margin of flexibility
                        in dealing with most governments. In general, we should stress that
                        achieving human rights <hi rend="italic">is a process</hi> and that we are
                        watching carefully progress toward greater respect for human rights,
                        realizing that there is no single standard for all the countries of the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>I believe that all of the foregoing is implicit in what you have been saying,
                        but making some of these points more explicit may make it more difficult for
                        your critics to attack your position and for others to distort it into
                        excessively rigid and politically confining meanings.</p>

                    <p>In preparation for President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Jimmy
                            Carter</persName>’s April 25, 1977, interview with European journalists,
                        President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs <persName
                            corresp="#p_BZK_1">Zbigniew Brzezinski</persName> provided the President
                        with a thematic overview in an April 23 memorandum. Brzezinki indicated that
                        the interview would help the President “set the scene for the London
                        summits” and afford him the opportunity to discuss his views on
                        “industrial-state relations.” He devoted the first portion of the memorandum
                        to the upcoming London meetings:</p>
                    <p>“The three meetings in London are all of a piece. In each, you have a chance
                        to meet, on a group and personal basis, the leaders of most of our
                        industrial state allies (you have seen so far <persName corresp="#p_CLJ_1"
                            >Callaghan</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_JKB_1">Jenkins</persName>,

                            >Fukuda</persName>, and Soares). In each meeting, you will be able to
                        lay out basic American commitments—both the steadfastness of purpose of a
                        new Administration and directions and guidelines for the future.</p>
                    <p>“This is a start on a new time of building—different from the late 1940s (all
                        start from an advanced industrial base, and the U.S. no longer has the same
                        economic pre-eminence); but this time of building is just as challenging,
                        just as vital, and even more difficult to gain popular support for new
                        directions.</p>
                    <p>“Your trip is a direct extension of Vice President <persName
                            corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName>’s trip 92 hours after
                        Inauguration: it is a break with the past, in that there is a much clearer
                        sense that allies are important in their own right, and that these relations
                        should have pre-eminence. The past three years of economic slump have also
                        reaffirmed the need for strong industrial state partners, in order to
                        guarantee the security and prosperity of any one <pb n="144" facs="0185"
                            xml:id="pg_144"/>nation. Interdependence has gone from being a slogan to
                        being a practical reality in everyday life.</p>
                    <p>“Thus the summit meetings will not produce spectacular new initiatives or
                        proposals for new institutions; that is not what is required, now. Instead,
                        the various leaders need to begin thinking in common about problems in
                        common. This can result in a framework for dealing jointly with basic
                        issues; about building a broad framework of industrial state concerns
                        leading to coordinated action. It is the creating of <hi rend="italic"
                            >ways</hi> and working together—ways that can be developed and will
                        endure over the coming years—that is the real ’news’ to be expected from the
                        summit, and the groundwork of future progress.</p>
                    <p>“Your energy policy is part of this new time of building. It will enable the
                        United States to play a more effective role in the world. Clearly, foreign
                        and domestic policies are related more closely together than at any other
                        time in peacetime history.</p>
                    <p>“<hi rend="italic">Basic Themes</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>“A number of basic American themes, to which you have been alluding in the
                        past three months, will become clearer at the summit meetings:</p>
                    <p>“<hi rend="italic">Leadership and Purpose:</hi> The emergence of the United
                        States from a time of doubt and uncertainty, in which even some of our
                        friends and allies abroad questioned our ability and willingness to act. An
                        American sense of purpose has returned: but it is more mature, and is
                        directed towards political and economic relations and developments—the
                        building of new patterns of behavior and action for the future, in a <hi
                            rend="italic">shared leadership</hi> with other nations.</p>
                    <p>“<hi rend="italic">Economic Actions:</hi> The need for coordinated strategies
                        for ending the recession, and for breaking loose from the ’stagnation’
                        pattern that led to the current difficulties (e.g. 15 million <gloss
                            target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> unemployed). In all of the commercial
                        issues—non-proliferation, arms transfers, defense procurement, advanced
                        technology—there must also be a sharing of benefits. In defense procurement,
                        a clear two-way street.</p>
                    <p>“<hi rend="italic">Institutions:</hi> The importance of strengthening the
                        work of existing institutions, whether <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> (where the issue is following-through on its potential) or
                        the Multilateral Trade Negotiations, or the <gloss target="#t_OECD_1"

                        and the <gloss target="#t_IEA_1">IEA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>“<hi rend="italic">Global Problems:</hi> The need for common effort on the
                        global problems that are either here, or are emerging: including the spread
                        of nuclear weapons (an issue that is inseparable from secure energy
                        resources for all nations), the transfer of conventional arms, the
                        relationship between rich and poor countries. In each, industrial-state
                        leadership is needed.</p>
                    <p>“<hi rend="italic">Developing World:</hi> The importance of not seeing the
                        industrial states as an exclusive club, but directly concerned with what is

                    <p>“No. I think within 100 hours of my becoming President, the Vice President
                        had begun consultations with the leaders of many nations in Europe. I have
                        already met with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CLJ_1"
                            >Callaghan</persName>, with the leaders of Portugal, with the European

                        other leaders within the next 2 weeks. And this will likely be the only trip
                        I shall take outside our country this year. I have no other plans at this
                        time.</p>
                    <p>“I think all these items describe my deep concern about good relationships
                        with Europe. I see no way that we can have a successful resolution of
                        East-West problems without the full comprehension, understanding,
                        participation with our allies and friends in Europe.</p>
                    <p>“We have, in addition to that, demonstrated, I think, in my own budget
                        proposals to the Congress, an increasing emphasis on military capability
                        within <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. And I intend to stay over

                        natural sense that our historical ties and our future are intimately related
                        with the European countries.</p>
                    <p>“The other part of your question is that I strongly favor, perhaps more than
                        my predecessors, a close interrelationship among the nations of Europe, the
                        European Community, in particular.</p>
                    <p>“We have a legitimate reticence about trying to interfere, but I will do
                        everything within the bounds of propriety to strengthen those natural
                        ties—economically, politically, militarily—that do exist now among the
                        countries of Europe and to strengthen them in the future. And when the
                        nations involved consider it appropriate, I would certainly welcome the
                        absorption within the European Community of Portugal and Spain.</p>
                    <p>“So, I think that already I have both come to realize and also have begun to
                        act on the premise of a strong Europe as essential to our own good future
                        and have recognized the importance of the bilateral relationships with the

                    <p>The memorandum which follows is an attempt to define your four-year foreign
                        policy goals. It is not meant to be a public statement—and its publication
                        or revelation would be counterproductive. It would provide your critics with
                        ammunition (both now and four years hence) and public disclosure would also
                        make it more difficult to attain many of your goals. Moreover, in some ways
                        any such statement is bound to be arbitrary and even simplistic—but
                        otherwise it would have to be a book, with all the explanations,
                        elaborations, and nuances included.</p>
                    <p>The document is not an interagency consensus statement. It was prepared, on

                    <p>As of now, <hi rend="italic">you are the first consumer of this
                            statement.</hi> It has not been cleared with the Secretary of State nor
                        with any other members of the Cabinet. At this stage, the document is meant
                        only for your personal consumption. Once revised on the basis of your
                        instructions and following a discussion with your principal advisers, it
                        should become a <pb n="148" facs="0189" xml:id="pg_148"/>decision paper from
                        the top down, rather than a consensual statement filtered upwards through
                        the bureaucracy.</p>
                    <p>This statement sets out <hi rend="italic">ten central objectives for the next
                            four years.</hi> It does not prescribe specific tactics but it does
                        propose steps for the attainment of these ten central objectives, in
                        addition to some others as well.</p>
                    <p>I believe the four year objectives—though ambitious—are realistic. In any
                        event, they provide both stimulus and discipline for the development of
                        specific policy choices for your decision. I should note that the second of
                        these central objectives—that we cultivate the new “regional
                        influentials”—is likely to be both controversial and possibly even
                        occasionally in conflict with some of the other goals. Yet I believe that
                        American interests and global stability require that we nourish a better
                        relationship with these key states. Not to do so is to deprive ourselves of
                        potentially very constructive relationships. Given the importance and
                        sensitivity of this proposal, I attach a special annex (Tab IV),<note n="3"

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Basic Concept</p>
                    <p>These ten central objectives are derived from a basic concept of what U.S.
                        foreign policy should be at this historical stage. <hi rend="italic">I want
                            to stress to you the importance of that concept.</hi> A foreign policy
                        to be effective must rest on a reasonably accurate assessment of the basic
                        historical need. The Soviets periodically undertake a very deliberate
                        reappraisal of their foreign policy based on the question: what is the
                        nature of our historical phase? Has that phase changed, and—if so—what are
                        the implications for the Soviet foreign policy? We should be similarly alert
                        to the meaning of historical change. U.S. foreign policy in the past was
                        relatively successful because the notions of Atlanticism and containment did
                        correspond to the major needs of the late 40’s and early 50’s. Accordingly,
                        this document is based on a unifying theme and you have to decide whether
                        the definition of that theme—in the section called “Overall Concept”—is

                        whatever changes you deem necessary, and give me further guidance; (2) that
                        following further revisions in the light of your directives, the document be
                        used as the basis for discussion with your principal advisers (such as the
                        Secretary of State), and possibly even with top Congressional leaders
                        (though perhaps without actual distribution); (3) that you give a

                            xml:id="pg_149"/>summit, using largely the conceptual part in order to

                        being voiced).</p>

                        <p>U.S. foreign policy can be expressed in terms of several broad purposes.
                            Though interrelated, these purposes imply, though not rigidly, a <pb
                                n="150" facs="0191" xml:id="pg_150"/>basic hierarchy. (At a specific
                            level, choices are often necessary—as in the exemption of South Korea on
                            security grounds from aid cutoff on human rights grounds).</p>
                        <p>These broad purposes are:</p>
                        <p>1. To assure the security of the United States;</p>
                        <p>2. To enhance peace by reducing international tensions and the
                            probability of war;</p>
                        <p>3. To promote the prosperity of the United States;</p>
                        <p>4. To advance global wellbeing by creating an open, cooperative and
                            equitable international economic order;</p>
                        <p>5. To expand fundamental human rights.</p>
                        <p>The document which follows is designed to promote all of these broad
                            purposes, and it attempts to translate them into more specific goals in
                            the political, economic and defense areas.</p>
                        <p>The basic conceptual frame of reference for the more specific goals is a
                            historical perspective, which sees the United States as having to play a
                            creative role in world affairs, in some ways similar to the role that
                            the United States played following 1945. At that time, the United States
                            in effect shaped a new international system, replacing the one that had
                            collapsed during World War II. That new system then endured and worked
                            reasonably well for the next quarter of a century or so. During much of
                            that time, the basic concept that guided U.S. foreign policy was a
                            combination of Atlanticism (primacy of the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >US</gloss>-European link) and containment of the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>Faced in the early 70’s with major world changes, the previous Republican
                            Administration then developed a foreign policy focused primarily on a
                            flexible balance of power, and on maneuver. It was also very pessimistic
                            foreign policy, based on the notion that America had no permanent
                            friends nor institutions on which it could rely, and that deeprooted
                            trends were against us.</p>
                        <p>Your policy, as recommended here, is different. It places emphasis not so
                            much on maneuver, but on building new structures—new relationships with
                            friends, with adversaries, with the developing world, even with the
                            whole world—that we hope will have a measure of permanence. It is,
                            therefore, an optimistic policy—we hope to build a better world—not
                            simply survive in a hostile one. <hi rend="italic">It is a policy of
                                constructive global engagement.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Its fundamental premise is that the U.S. needs to play today a role as
                            constructive as the one it played after World War II, but in a vastly
                            changed context.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. has to help in the shaping of a new international system that
                            cannot be confined to the developed countries but must involve
                            increasingly the entire international community of more than 150 nation
                            states. Unlike the years 1945–50, this calls not for American dictation
                                <pb n="151" facs="0192" xml:id="pg_151"/>but for more subtle
                            inspiration and cooperative leadership on a much wider front. The
                            international community, in addition to the traditional dilemmas of war
                            and peace, now confronts global problems never before faced by
                            mankind.</p>
                        <p>The need thus is not for a new anti-communist coalition, nor for an
                            updated Atlanticism, nor for a policy focused only on the new nations,
                            and certainly not for protectionism and isolationism. Rather, it
                            requires <hi rend="italic">a broad architectural process</hi> for an
                            unstable world organized almost entirely on the principle of national
                            sovereignty and yet increasingly interdependent socially and
                            economically. In that process of widening cooperation, our relationships
                            will have to involve varying degrees of intimacy:</p>
                        <p>1. With our closest friends in the industrial world—countries which share
                            our values, have political systems similar to ours, and which because of
                            their wealth have a special burden of responsibility to the rest of
                            mankind—we will seek to deepen our collaboration;</p>
                        <p>2. With the emerging states, we will seek to develop close bilateral
                            relations in some key cases, and to widen and to institutionalize
                            arrangements for more genuine global cooperation;</p>
                        <p>3. With states with which we compete militarily and ideologically, we
                            will seek through appropriate arrangements to reduce the chances of war
                            and to codify more precise rules of reciprocal restraint.</p>

                            <hi rend="roman">II.</hi> TEN CENTRAL OBJECTIVES</p>
                        <p>With that basic concept as our point of departure, and in keeping with
                            it, it is recommended that your foreign policy seek to attain during the
                            coming four years these <hi rend="italic">central ten goals</hi>
                            (developed more specifically in the third part of this document):</p>
                        <p>1. To engage Western Europe, Japan and other advanced democracies in
                            closer political cooperation through the increasing institutionalization
                            of consultative relationships, and to promote wider macro-economic
                            coordination pointing towards a stable and open monetary and trade
                            system. Genuine collaboration with these states is the foundation stone
                            of U.S. policy, and we must seek to intensify and to multiply our
                            consultative links;</p>
                        <p>2. To weave a worldwide web of bilateral, political and, where
                            appropriate, economic cooperation with the new emerging regional
                            “influentials”—thereby widening, in keeping with new historical
                            circumstances, our earlier reliance on Atlanticism or, more lately, on
                            trilateralism. These regional influentials include Venezuela, Brazil,
                            Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, Indonesia, in addition to our more
                            traditional friends;</p>
                        <p>3. To exploit the foregoing in the development of more accommodating
                            North-South relations, both political and economic, through <pb n="152"
                                facs="0193" xml:id="pg_152"/>such devices as the Global Development
                            Budget, the institutionalization of <gloss target="#t_CIEC_1"
                                >CIEC</gloss>, the shaping of links between <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1"
                                >OPEC</gloss>, etc.;</p>
                        <p>4. To push U.S.-Soviet strategic arms limitation talks into strategic
                            arms reduction talks, using the foregoing as an entering wedge for a
                            more stable U.S.-Soviet relationship. At the same time, we should seek
                            to rebuff Soviet incursions, both by supporting our friends and by
                            ameliorating the sources of conflict which the Soviets exploit. We
                            should match Soviet ideological expansion by a more affirmative American
                            posture on global human rights, while seeking consistently to make
                            detente both more comprehensive and more reciprocal;</p>
                        <p>5. To normalize U.S.-Chinese relations in order to preserve the
                            U.S.-Chinese relationship as a major stabilizing factor in the global
                            power balance, offsetting Soviet conventional superiority and preventing
                            the Soviet Union from concentrating its resources on a westward (Europe)
                            or southward (Middle East, Africa) expansionary drive;</p>
                        <p>6. To obtain a comprehensive Middle Eastern settlement, without which the
                            further radicalization of the Arab world and the reentry of the Soviet
                            Union into the Middle East cannot for long be avoided, generating in
                            turn serious consequences for Western Europe, Japan, and the United
                            States;</p>
                        <p>7. To set in motion a progressive and peaceful transformation of South
                            Africa towards a biracial democracy and to forge—in connection with this
                            process—a coalition of moderate black African leaders in order to stem
                            continental radicalization and to eliminate the Soviet-Cuban presence
                            from the continent;</p>
                        <p>8. To restrict the level of global armaments through international
                            agreements limiting the excessive flow of arms into the Third World
                            (though with some consideration for goal No. 2), cooperative
                            international restraints on nuclear proliferation, and a comprehensive
                            test ban on nuclear testing;</p>
                        <p>9. To enhance global sensitivity to human rights through actions designed
                            to highlight U.S. observance of such rights and through multilateral and
                            bilateral initiatives meant to influence other governments to give
                            higher priority to such human rights;</p>
                        <p>10. To maintain a defense posture capable of deterring the Soviet Union
                            both on the strategic and conventional levels from hostile acts and from
                            political pressure. This will require the U.S. to modernize,
                            rationalize, and reconceptualize its defense posture in keeping with the
                            broad changes in world affairs that have already been noted, to improve
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> military strength and
                            readiness, and to develop capabilities to deter or to counter Soviet
                            military intervention in the Third World.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted in connection with these broad objectives that the
                            promotion of human rights is a goal that cross-cuts our relations <pb
                                n="153" facs="0194" xml:id="pg_153"/>with the Soviet Union, the
                            developing countries, and particularly the new regional influentials. In
                            all these cases, our leverage should be used discreetly to advance human
                            rights but no specific targets can be prescribed precisely.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the point to stress is that human rights is <hi rend="italic">a
                                broad concept</hi>. These two words should mean much more than
                            political liberty, the right to vote, and protection against arbitrary
                            governmental action. Human rights, and this we should stress, means also
                            certain basic minimum standards of social and economic existence. In
                            effect, human rights refers to all three (political, social, and
                            economic) and this is why these words have such universal appeal.</p>
                        <p>Such a broader, and more flexible definition would have several
                            advantages: it would retain for us the desirable identification with a
                            human cause whose time has come, and yet it would avoid some of the
                            rigidities that are potential in the narrower political definition. It
                            would give us the freedom to point at the most glaring abuses (e.g.,
                            political suppression in some countries, or total social indifference in
                            others), though leaving us the necessary margin of flexibility in
                            dealing with most governments. In general, we should stress that
                            achieving human rights <hi rend="italic">is a process</hi> and that we
                            are watching carefully progress toward greater respect for human rights,
                            realizing that there is no single standard for all the countries of the
                            world.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Human Rights and Foreign Policy</p>
                    <p>I speak today about the resolve of this Administration to make the
                        advancement of human rights a central part of our foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>Many here today have long been advocates of human rights within our own
                        society. And throughout our nation that struggle for civil rights
                        continues.</p>
                    <p>In the early years of our civil rights movement, many Americans treated the
                        issue as a “Southern” problem. They were wrong. It was and is a problem for
                        all of us.</p>
                    <p>Now, as a nation, we must not make a comparable mistake. Protection of human
                        rights is a challenge for <hi rend="italic">all</hi> countries, not just for
                        a few.</p>
                    <p>Our human rights policy must be understood in order to be effective. So today
                        I want to set forth the substance of that policy and the results we hope to
                        achieve.</p>
                    <p>Our concern for human rights is built upon ancient values. It looks with hope
                        to a world in which liberty is not just a great cause, but the common
                        condition. In the past, it may have seemed sufficient to put our name to
                        international documents that spoke loftily of human rights. That is not
                        enough. We will go to work, alongside other people and governments, to
                        protect and enhance the dignity of the individual.</p>
                    <p>Let me define what we mean by “human rights.”</p>
                    <p>First, there is the right to be free from governmental violation of the
                        integrity of the person. Such violations include torture; cruel, inhuman, or
                        degrading treatment or punishment; and arbitrary arrest or imprisonment. And
                        they include denial of fair public trial and invasion of the home.</p>
                    <pb n="155" facs="0196" xml:id="pg_155"/>
                    <p>Second, there is the right to the fulfillment of such vital needs as food,
                        shelter, health care, and education. We recognize that the fulfillment of
                        this right will depend, in part, upon the stage of a nation’s economic
                        development. But we also know that this right can be violated by a
                        government’s action or inaction—for example, through corrupt official
                        processes which divert resources to an elite at the expense of the needy or
                        through indifference to the plight of the poor.</p>
                    <p>Third, there is the right to enjoy civil and political liberties: freedom of
                        thought, of religion, of assembly; freedom of speech; freedom of the press;
                        freedom of movement both within and outside one’s own country; freedom to
                        take part in government.</p>
                    <p>Our policy is to promote all these rights. They are all recognized in the
                        Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a basic document which the United
                        States helped fashion and which the United Nations approved in 1948.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d37fn2">See <ref target="#d29fn17">footnote 17, Document
                                29</ref>.</note> There may be disagreement on the priorities these
                        rights deserve. But I believe that, with work, all of these rights can
                        become complementary and mutually reinforcing.</p>
                    <p>The philosophy of our human rights policy is revolutionary in the
                        intellectual sense, reflecting our nation’s origin and progressive values.
                        As <persName corresp="#p_MA_1">Archibald MacLeish</persName> wrote during
                        our Bicentennial a year ago: “. . . the cause of human liberty is now the
                        one great revolutionary cause. . . .”</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> put it this way in
                        his speech before the United Nations:</p>
                    <p>All the signatories of the United Nations Charter have pledged themselves to
                        observe and to respect basic human rights. Thus, no member of the United
                        Nations can claim that mistreatment of its citizens is solely its own
                        business. Equally, no member can avoid its responsibilities to review and to
                        speak when torture or unwarranted deprivation occurs in any part of the
                            world.<note n="3" xml:id="d37fn3">See <ref target="#d29">Document
                                29</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Since 1945, international practice has confirmed that a nation’s obligation
                        to respect human rights is a matter of concern in international law.</p>
                    <p>Our obligation under the United Nations Charter is written into our own
                        legislation. For example, our Foreign Assistance Act now reads: “. . . a
                        principal goal of the foreign policy of the United States is to promote the
                        increased observance of internationally recognized human rights by all
                            countries.”<note n="4" xml:id="d37fn4">Reference is to the Foreign
                            Assistance Act of 1961 (S. 1983; <gloss target="#t_PL_1">P.L.</gloss>

                            amended the Foreign Assistance Act to include this goal.</note>

                    <p>In these ways, our policy is in keeping with our tradition, our international
                        obligations, and our laws.</p>
                    <p>In pursuing a human rights policy, we must always keep in mind the limits of
                        our power and of our wisdom. A sure formula for defeat of our goals would be
                        a rigid, hubristic attempt to impose our values on others. A doctrinaire
                        plan of action would be as damaging as indifference.</p>
                    <p>We must be realistic. Our country can only achieve our objectives if we shape
                        what we do to the case at hand. In each instance, we will consider these
                        questions as we determine whether and how to act:</p>
                    <p>1. First, we will ask ourselves, what is the nature of the case that
                        confronts us? For example:</p>
                    <p>What kinds of violations or deprivations are there? What is their extent?</p>
                    <p>Is there a pattern to the violations? If so, is the trend toward concern for
                        human rights or away from it?</p>
                    <p>What is the degree of control and responsibility of the government
                        involved?</p>
                    <p>And finally, is the government willing to permit independent outside
                        investigation?</p>
                    <p>2. A second set of questions concerns the prospects for effective action:</p>
                    <p>Will our action be useful in promoting the overall cause of human rights?</p>
                    <p>Will it actually improve the specific conditions at hand? Or will it be
                        likely to make things worse instead?</p>
                    <p>Is the country involved receptive to our interest and efforts?</p>
                    <p>Will others work with us, including official and private international
                        organizations dedicated to furthering human rights?</p>
                    <p>Finally, does our sense of values and decency demand that we speak out or
                        take action anyway, even though there is only a remote chance of making our
                        influence felt?</p>
                    <p>3. We will ask a third set of questions in order to maintain a sense of
                        perspective:</p>
                    <p>Have we steered away from the self-righteous and strident, remembering that
                        our own record is not unblemished?</p>
                    <p>Have we been sensitive to genuine security interests, realizing that outbreak
                        of armed conflict or terrorism could in itself pose a serious threat to
                        human rights?</p>
                    <p>Have we considered <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the rights at stake? If, for
                        instance, we reduce aid to a government which violates the political rights
                        of its cit<pb n="157" facs="0198" xml:id="pg_157"/>izens, do we not risk
                        penalizing the hungry and poor, who bear no responsibility for the abuses of
                        their government?</p>
                    <p>If we are determined to act, the means available range from quiet diplomacy
                        in its many forms, through public pronouncements, to withholding of
                        assistance. Whenever possible, we will use positive steps of encouragement
                        and inducement. Our strong support will go to countries that are working to
                        improve the human condition. We will always try to act in concert with other
                        countries, through international bodies.</p>
                    <p>In the end, a decision whether and how to act in the cause of human rights is
                        a matter for informed and careful judgment. No mechanistic formula produces
                        an automatic answer.</p>
                    <p>It is not our purpose to intervene in the internal affairs of other
                        countries, but as the President has emphasized, no member of the United
                        Nations can claim that violation of internationally protected human rights
                        is solely its own affair. It is our purpose to shape our policies in accord
                        with our beliefs and to state them without stridency or apology when we
                        think it is desirable to do so.</p>
                    <p>Our policy is to be applied within our own society as well as abroad. We
                        welcome constructive criticism at the same time as we offer it.</p>
                    <p>No one should suppose that we are working in a vacuum. We place great weight
                        on joining with others in the cause of human rights.</p>
                    <p>The U.N. system is central to this cooperative endeavor. That is why the
                        President stressed the pursuit of human rights in his speech before the
                        General Assembly last month. That is why he is calling for U.S. ratification
                        of four important human rights covenants and conventions and why we are
                        trying to strengthen the human rights machinery within the United
                        Nations.</p>
                    <p>And that is an important reason why we have moved to comply with U.N.
                        sanctions against Rhodesia. In one of our first acts, this Administration
                        sought and achieved repeal of the Byrd amendment,<note n="5" xml:id="d37fn5"

                        placed us in violation of these sanctions and thus in violation of
                        international law. We are supporting other diplomatic efforts within the
                        United Nations to promote basic civil and political rights in Namibia and
                        throughout southern Africa.</p>
                    <p>Regional organizations also play a central role in promoting human rights.
                        The President has announced that the United States will sign and seek Senate

                    <p>The United States is seeking increased consultation with other nations for

                        human rights. We are working to assure that our efforts reach out to all,
                        with particular sensitivity to the problems of women.</p>
                    <p>We will meet in Belgrade later this year to review implementation of the
                        Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe—the
                        so-called Helsinki conference. We will take this occasion to work for
                        progress there on important human issues: family reunification, binational
                        marriages, travel for personal and professional reasons, and freer access to
                        information.</p>
                    <p>The United States looks to use of economic assistance—whether bilateral or
                        through international financial institutions—as a means to foster basic
                        human rights.</p>
                    <p>—We have proposed a 20 percent increase in U.S. foreign economic assistance

                        Department’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs stress support for
                        law in society, a free press, freedom of communication, an open educational
                        system, and respect for ethnic diversity.</p>
                    <p>This Administration’s human rights policy has been framed in collaboration
                        and consultation with Congress and private organizations. We have taken
                        steps to assure firsthand contact, consultation, and observation when
                        Members of Congress travel abroad to review human rights conditions.</p>
                    <p>We are implementing current laws that bring human rights considerations
                        directly into our decisions in several international financial institutions.
                        At the same time, we are working with the Congress to find the most
                        effective way to fulfill our parallel commitment to international
                        cooperation in economic development.</p>

                    <p>In accordance with human rights provisions of legislation governing our
                        security assistance programs, we recently announced cuts in military aid to

                    </p>
                    <p>Outside the government, there is much that can be done. We welcome the
                        efforts of individual American citizens and private organizations—such as
                        religious, humanitarian, and professional groups—to work for human rights
                        with commitments of time, money, and compassion.</p>
                    <p>All these initiatives to further human rights abroad would have a hollow ring
                        if we were not prepared to improve our own performance at home. So we have
                        removed all restrictions on our citizens’ travel abroad and are proceeding
                        with plans to liberalize our visa policies.</p>
                    <p>We support legislation and administrative action to expand our refugee and
                        asylum policies and to permit more victims of repressive regimes to enter
                        the United States. During this last year, the United States spent some $475
                        million on assistance to refugees around the world, and we accepted 31,000
                        refugees for permanent resettlement in this country.</p>
                    <p>What results can we expect from all these efforts?</p>
                    <p>We may justifiably seek a rapid end to such gross violations as those cited
                        in our law: “torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
                        punishment, (or) prolonged detention without charges. . . .” Just last week
                        our Ambassador at the United Nations, <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Andrew
                            Young</persName>, suggested a series of new ways to confront the

                            <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Young</persName> presented a statement

                            Council (<gloss target="#t_ECOSOC_1">ECOSOC</gloss>) on April 19, in
                            which he spoke to three basic fears: “the fear of hunger, the fear of
                            torture, and the fear of racism,” adding that the three “are basic
                            problems that we could attack with near-unanimity and high expectations
                            of significant success if we agreed to focus on them as priorities.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Young</persName> suggested that with
                            regard to torture, the United Nations might consider establishing a

                            of investigating torture “on a worldwide basis” and staff a panel of
                            “distinguished nonpartisan experts” who could carry out the mandate. For

                    </p>
                    <p>The promotion of other human rights is a broader challenge. The results may
                        be slower in coming but are no less worth pursuing. And we intend to let
                        other countries know where we stand.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that many nations of the world are organized on authoritarian
                        rather than democratic principles—some large and powerful, others struggling
                        to raise the lives of their people above bare subsistence levels. We can
                        nourish no illusions that a call to the banner of <pb n="160" facs="0201"
                            xml:id="pg_160"/>human rights will bring sudden transformations in
                        authoritarian societies.</p>
                    <p>We are embarked on a long journey. But our faith in the dignity of the
                        individual encourages us to believe that people in every society, according
                        to their own traditions, will in time give their own expression to this
                        fundamental aspiration.</p>
                    <p>Our belief is strengthened by the way the Helsinki principles and the U.N.
                        Declaration of Human Rights have found resonance in the hearts of people of
                        many countries. Our task is to sustain this faith by our example and our
                        encouragement.</p>
                    <p>In his inaugural address three months ago, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> said, “Because we are free we can
                        never be indifferent to the fate of freedom elsewhere.” Again, at a meeting
                        of the Organization of American States two weeks ago, he said, “You will
                        find this country . . . eager to stand beside those nations which respect
                        human rights and which promote democratic ideals.”</p>
                    <p>We seek these goals because they are right—and because we, too, will benefit.
                        Our own well-being, and even our security, are enhanced in a world that
                        shares common freedoms and in which prosperity and economic justice create
                        the conditions for peace. And let us remember that we always risk paying a
                        serious price when we become identified with repression.</p>
                    <p>Nations, like individuals, limit their potential when they limit their goals.
                        The American people understand this. I am confident they will support
                        foreign policies that reflect our traditional values. To offer less is to
                        define America in ways we should not accept.</p>
                    <p>America fought for freedom in 1776 and in two World Wars. We have offered
                        haven to the oppressed. Millions have come to our shores in times of
                        trouble. In times of devastation abroad, we have shared our resources.</p>
                    <p>Our encouragement and inspiration to other nations and other peoples have
                        never been limited to the power of our military or the bounty of our
                        economy. They have been lifted up by the message of our Revolution, the
                        message of individual human freedom. That message has been our great
                        national asset in times past. So it should be again.</p>

                    <p>“We will have long discussions about close political interrelationships,
                        consultations, with our closest allies and friends. We’ll be dealing with
                        problems that concern <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, the defense of

                        future.</p>
                    <p>“I’ll be having bilateral private consultations with more than a dozen
                        leaders of foreign countries. I feel well briefed and well prepared. And my
                        own hope is that I can well and truly represent what the American people
                        would like to see their President do in discussing world problems with other
                        world leaders.</p>
                    <p>“We will be pursuing our long-range goals for world peace, for nuclear
                        disarmament, for holding down the sale of conventional weapons, for
                        preventing the spread of the capability for nuclear explosives among nations
                        that don’t share it, for a discussion about the proper uses of energy and
                        the sharing of world trade with others, for loans and direct aid to the
                        less-developed countries, and the establishment of basic mechanisms by which
                        these discussions can continue, not just at the summit level on special
                        occasions but on a continual day-to-day interrelationship.” (<hi

                        session, which began at 11 a.m. in the Long Gallery at Lancaster House,
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> addressed the
                        participants. After brief introductory remarks, <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> underscored the importance of
                        relations among the industrial democracies in light of potential military
                        and political challenges of the upcoming decade:</p>
                    <p>“At the center of this effort must be strong ties between Europe and North
                        America. In maintaining and strengthening these ties, my administration will
                        be guided by certain principles. Simply stated:</p>
                    <p>“—We will continue to make the Alliance the heart of our foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>“—We will remain a reliable and faithful ally.</p>
                    <pb n="163" facs="0204" xml:id="pg_163"/>
                    <p>“—We will join with you to strengthen the Alliance—politically, economically,
                        and militarily.</p>
                    <p>“—We will ask for and listen to the advice of our allies. And we will give
                        our views in return, candidly and as friends.</p>
                    <p>“This effort rests on a strong foundation. The state of the Alliance is good.
                        Its strategy and doctrine are solid. We derive added strength and new pride
                        from the fact that all 15 of our member countries are now democracies. Our
                        alliance is a pact for peace <hi rend="italic">and</hi> a pact for
                        freedom.</p>
                    <p>“The Alliance is even stronger because of solid progress toward Western
                        European unification and the expanding role of the European Community in
                        world affairs. The United States welcomes this development and will work
                        closely with the Community.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: Carter,

                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> devoted the remainder of his
                        remarks to outlining the areas of cooperation in political and defense
                        matters. He underscored the complexity of East-West relations, adding that
                        the approach to this relationship “must be guided both by a humane vision
                        and by a sense of history. Our humane vision leads us to seek broad
                        cooperation with Communist states for the good of mankind. Our sense of
                        history teaches us that we and the Soviet Union will continue to compete.
                        Yet if we manage this dual relationship properly, we can hope that
                        cooperation will eventually overshadow competition, leading to an
                        increasingly stable relationship between our countries and the Soviet
                        Union.” (Ibid.) The President listed arms control, arms limitation, and
                        human rights as areas for cooperation with the Soviet Union, recognizing
                        that any success in these areas depended upon close consultation with the
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> members. He also proposed that
                        the Council undertake a review of East-West relations that might assess
                        future trends and implications. Turning to defense matters, <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> stressed: “Achieving our political
                        goals depends on a credible defense and deterrent. The United States
                        supports the existing strategy of flexible response and forward defense. We
                        will continue to provide our share of the powerful forces adequate to
                        fulfill this strategy. We will maintain an effective strategic deterrent, we
                        will keep diverse and modern theatre nuclear forces in Europe, and we will
                        maintain and improve conventional forces based here.” (Ibid., page 850) He
                        underscored cooperation in this area, as well, notably in the “development,
                        production, and procurement of Alliance defense equipment.” (Ibid., page
                        851) He reiterated these themes in his closing statement:</p>
                    <p>“To conclude:</p>
                    <p>“It is not enough for us to share common purposes; we must also strengthen
                        the institutions that fulfill those purposes. We are met today to renew our
                        dedication to one of the most important of those institu<pb n="164"
                            facs="0205" xml:id="pg_164"/>tions and to plan for actions that will
                        help it to meet new challenges. Some of these actions can be taken in the
                        near future. Others can be developed for review at our meeting next year at
                        this time. I would be glad to offer Washington as the site of that
                        meeting.</p>
                    <p>“The French writer and aviator, Saint-Exupéry, wrote that ’the noblest task
                        of mankind is to unite mankind.’ In that spirit, I am confident that we will
                        succeed.” (Ibid., page 852)</p>
                    <p>The President provided a summation of his entire visit during remarks to news
                        correspondents on May 10. In reference to that morning’s address, <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> commented:</p>
                    <p>“I think as far as the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> meeting was
                        concerned, most of the nations were relieved to know that the reluctance on
                        the part of the United States 3 or 4 years ago to participate fully in
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> is now past, that we are a full
                        partner, that our financial commitment to conventional forces in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> are stronger than they were before. And
                        I think that if they carry out the suggestions that I made this morning—and
                        they were adopted unanimously—to do an analysis of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> for the 1980s, to do a complete analysis of the
                        relationship between the Western democratic societies and the Eastern
                        Communist societies, and also to share the benefits of <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> as far as the purchase of equipment and
                        so forth is concerned—these, of course, will be made back in Washington next

                            advanced weaponry. However, the President, on May 12, asserted that the
                            United States had ” ’special security responsibilities’ ” to Israel and
                            that the Government of Israel would be able to purchase the advanced

                        apprehension continued in the American Jewish community concerning a
                        possible peace plan that <pb n="166" facs="0207" xml:id="pg_166"/>the
                        Administration would present at some point, combined with pressure to
                        implement it. This plan, he believes, would consist of calling for peace in
                        return for substantially complete Israeli withdrawal and the establishment
                        of an independent Palestinian state on the West Bank, which would be headed
                        by the <gloss target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>. He asked for reassurances that
                        this was not American governmental thinking.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> replied that it was
                        natural that some apprehensions exist at a time when we stand on the
                        threshold of possibly important historical developments. In his view, the
                        question of Israel’s ability to survive as a strong and independent country,
                        and the issue of whether the United States would support Israel, have been
                        settled. The question is now whether Israel’s permanence can be translated
                        into a lasting peace. The kind of peace, and how it might be implemented,
                        and the consequences that would follow from peace, must now be considered
                        carefully. Peace, as difficult as it may be to achieve, will be much better
                        than the continuing stalemate without peace. Israel’s role, he noted, would
                        be absolutely essential. In a peaceful Middle East, Israel could become the
                        Switzerland of the Middle East. One needs to consider the trade-off between
                        peace and stalemate. Stalemate runs the risk of war, continuing high
                        military expenditures, and dependency on the United States. Movement toward
                        peace can help to allay some of the concerns that now exist. The President
                        feels that our relationship with Israel is a unique one and that it has
                        spiritual and organic qualities.</p>
                    <p>On the question of whether the United States has a plan, if by that one means
                        a blueprint that we are preparing to impose on the parties, the answer, Dr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> stated, is an
                        unequivocal “No.” If by plan one means some concept of a peace settlement,
                        the answer is “Yes.” Our concept is based on a historical vision of how the
                        conflict can be resolved and the President has spoken openly of this, as did
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_RY_1">Rabin</persName> when he was
                            here.<note n="3" xml:id="d39fn3">See <ref target="frus1977-80v08#d18">

                        been thinking in terms of a meaningful peace, of establishing a framework
                        for negotiations, and we have identified and repeated that negotiations will
                        have to deal with the nature of peace, territory and security, and the
                        Palestinian question. We have talked to Israeli and Arab leaders on these
                        issues, pressing the Arabs to be more explicit on peace and the Israelis to
                        be more explicit on territory and the Palestinians. That is where we are
                        today. We hope that we can find some areas of complementarity and that we
                        will then be able to prepare for a Geneva Conference. We cannot be certain
                        of success, but it is an act of historical obligation to try to think
                        constructively about a settlement. The parties themselves, <pb n="167"
                            facs="0208" xml:id="pg_167"/>however, will have to negotiate the final
                        settlement, but we are trying to get them to think about the issues
                        clearly.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HA_1">Hertzberg</persName> noted that the
                        American-Jewish leadership does not favor immobilism. All agree on the need
                        for peace, and the President’s statements that peace must be real have been
                        viewed in a very positive way. The concern in the American Jewish community
                        stems from the statement that the United States is asking Israel to be more
                        explicit on the Palestinians and on territory. There is concern about the
                        idea of a Palestinian entity which might be led by the <gloss
                            target="#t_PLO_1">PLO</gloss>. The United States should not be the party
                        to decide on such a state, but rather should try to end the conflict in a
                        way that will be stable.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> noted that one should
                        not conclude that our preference is for a <gloss target="#t_PLO_1"
                            >PLO</gloss>-dominated state. Since we have no plan, we cannot define
                        precisely how the Palestinian issue might be resolved, but we have some
                        preferences that the West Bank and Jordan be linked. The question is how to
                        get there. Should the United States push for this outcome, or should Israel
                        dictate it, or should the Arabs themselves reach this conclusion? Clearly,
                        the last is the best outcome. Arab views seem to be more realistic and Arab
                        leaders recognize that a volatile situation in the West Bank is not in their
                        interests. The facts of the situation are forcing the Arabs to think
                        realistically. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> stated
                        that his personal view is that a situation should not be imposed on the
                        Palestinians, which they would reject and then turn to the Soviet Union. It
                        would be better to have an Arab consensus on an outcome that Palestinian
                        moderates could accept. The present Arab leadership is the most moderate
                        that has existed since 1947.</p>
                    <p>In response to a question, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                            >Brzezinski</persName> noted that the American objective now is to
                        establish a framework within which the parties will be able to deal with the
                        issues. The President’s statements have not resolved issues yet, but they
                        have begun a probing of the issues. His use of words has been cautious and
                        he has not prejudged outcomes, but he has tried to clarify underlying
                        issues. Once the parties get to the negotiating table, we hope that the
                        negotiations will not break down. There has to be an understood basis for
                        negotiation, and this is the reason for developing the conceptual framework.
                        He noted that the United States will not try to develop a blueprint, nor
                        will it threaten Israel with the question of its survival, but we will talk
                        frankly and honestly with Israel, and we will say the same thing to both
                        Israel and the Arabs.</p>
                    <p>Responding to a comment on defensible borders, Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> noted that he did not
                        personally use that term. Israel has good defense lines today, but they are
                        not borders. The borders of the final peace settlement, if they are
                        recognized, will not be defensible in the same sense that they are today,
                        but if Israel retains the current lines that she now occupies, these will
                        never become recognized borders. So defensible <pb n="168" facs="0209"
                            xml:id="pg_168"/>borders in any simple sense do not make much sense.
                        Instead, one must try to think about what borders might be recognized and
                        what recognition would be worth, combined with other arrangements for
                        security that might be made. In the age of nationalism, he noted, territory
                        is integrally tied to the sense of nationhood. Only Germany has accepted
                        major territorial losses, and that was in context of total defeat and a
                        recognition of guilt that went with the defeat. This is not the case with
                        the Arabs, and we cannot expect them to abandon their claims to substantial
                        amounts of their territory. Instead of referring to defensible borders, we
                        should talk of mutually accepted borders, legitimacy, and should try to
                        develop arrangements to support the agreements which will provide for
                        fool-proof security. The President has been hinting at this. Security
                        arrangements for Israel might include a binding <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> commitment. Israel is not totally independent and if Israel
                        must be dependent, it might be best to make the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> tie to Israel a binding one. One way would be through
                        treaties.</p>
                    <p>A question was then raised concerning American arms supply, and Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> said that it was difficult to
                        be specific. He argued against the notion that the Defense Department was
                        deliberately obstructive, citing the recent case of the Chariot tank where
                        allegations of obstruction had not been well founded.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d39fn4">Reference is to a front-engineered, 56-ton tank known as

                        declined to answer, stating that this would have to be dealt with in the
                        broad framework that the President has tried to set out whereby our policy
                        aims at gaining the confidence of Israelis and Arabs, while, at the same
                        time, trying on a global basis for arms reductions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FMM_1">Fisher</persName> remarked that he hoped the
                        United States would ask for more than moderation in words from the Arabs and
                        that we would also look for moderation in terms of their action toward
                        Israel. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> responded by
                        acknowledging that Arab culture seems to favor some verbal exaggeration, and
                        that on occasion Arab leaders seem to tell different things to different
                        audiences. We are trying, however, to move the Arabs to take binding public
                        positions from which they find it difficult to retreat. Concerning Arab
                        intentions, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> noted
                        that some Arabs may still hope that Israel can ultimately be destroyed in a
                        second phase to follow a peace agreement. We will therefore insist on more
                        than verbal assurances of their intentions, and will demand that objective
                        barriers be created to make the second phase, if that is <pb n="169"
                            facs="0210" xml:id="pg_169"/>their intention, an impossibility. We want
                        to make phase two an impossibility and phase one so attractive that they
                        will commit themselves to it.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> agreed to a statement
                        that Rabbi <persName corresp="#p_SA_2">Schindler</persName> could use with
                        the press to describe the Administration’s attitude. The agreed statement is
                        as follows:</p>
                    <p>“We had a comprehensive discussion of the Middle East situation, including

                        Administration’s underlying commitment to the security of Israel, and
                        particularly to the special and organic relationship that binds the United
                        States to Israel. He further noted that the Administration’s statements on
                        the questions of territory, the Palestinians, and peace do not represent a
                        blueprint to be imposed, but rather are a conceptual framework within which
                        the parties can negotiate a peaceful settlement to the Middle East
                        conflict.”</p>

                            Book I, pp. 954–962. The President spoke at 3:25 p.m. at the

                            Convocation Center. Father <persName corresp="#p_HT_1"
                                >Hesburgh</persName> conferred an honorary doctor of laws degree on
                            the President and then offered opening remarks. On March 18, <persName

                        the dark faith of our times—that our Government can be both competent and

                    </p>
                    <p>But I want to speak to you today about the strands that connect our actions
                        overseas with our essential character as a nation. I believe we can have a
                        foreign policy that is democratic, that is based on fundamental values, and
                        that uses power and influence, which we have, for humane purposes. We can
                        also have a foreign policy that the American people both support and, for a
                        change, know about and understand.</p>
                    <p>I have a quiet confidence in our own political system. Because we know that
                        democracy works, we can reject the arguments of those rulers who deny human
                        rights to their people.</p>
                    <p>We are confident that democracy’s example will be compelling, and so we seek
                        to bring that example closer to those from whom in the past few years we
                        have been separated and who are not yet convinced about the advantages of
                        our kind of life.</p>
                    <p>We are confident that the democratic methods are the most effective, and so
                        we are not tempted to employ improper tactics here at home or abroad.</p>
                    <p>We are confident of our own strength, so we can seek substantial mutual
                        reductions in the nuclear arms race.</p>
                    <p>And we are confident of the good sense of American people, and so we let them
                        share in the process of making foreign policy decisions. We can thus speak
                        with the voices of 215 million, and not just of an isolated handful.</p>
                    <pb n="171" facs="0212" xml:id="pg_171"/>
                    <p>Democracy’s great recent successes—in India, Portugal, Spain, Greece—show
                        that our confidence in this system is not misplaced. Being confident of our
                        own future, we are now free of that inordinate fear of communism which once
                        led us to embrace any dictator who joined us in that fear. I’m glad that
                        that’s being changed.</p>
                    <p>For too many years, we’ve been willing to adopt the flawed and erroneous
                        principles and tactics of our adversaries, sometimes abandoning our own
                        values for theirs. We’ve fought fire with fire, never thinking that fire is
                        better quenched with water. This approach failed, with Vietnam the best
                        example of its intellectual and moral poverty. But through failure we have
                        now found our way back to our own principles and values, and we have
                        regained our lost confidence.</p>
                    <p>By the measure of history, our Nation’s 200 years are very brief, and our
                        rise to world eminence is briefer still. It dates from 1945, when Europe and
                        the old international order lay in ruins. Before then, America was largely
                        on the periphery of world affairs. But since then, we have inescapably been
                        at the center of world affairs.</p>
                    <p>Our policy during this period was guided by two principles: a belief that
                        Soviet expansion was almost inevitable but that it must be contained, and
                        the corresponding belief in the importance of an almost exclusive alliance
                        among non-Communist nations on both sides of the Atlantic. That system could
                        not last forever unchanged. Historical trends have weakened its foundation.
                        The unifying threat of conflict with the Soviet Union has become less
                        intensive, even though the competition has become more extensive.</p>
                    <p>The Vietnamese war produced a profound moral crisis, sapping worldwide faith
                        in our own policy and our system of life, a crisis of confidence made even
                        more grave by the covert pessimism of some of our leaders.</p>
                    <p>In less than a generation, we’ve seen the world change dramatically. The
                        daily lives and aspirations of most human beings have been transformed.
                        Colonialism is nearly gone. A new sense of national identity now exists in
                        almost 100 new countries that have been formed in the last generation.
                        Knowledge has become more widespread. Aspirations are higher. As more people
                        have been freed from traditional constraints, more have been determined to
                        achieve, for the first time in their lives, social justice.</p>
                    <p>The world is still divided by ideological disputes, dominated by regional
                        conflicts, and threatened by danger that we will not resolve the differences
                        of race and wealth without violence or without drawing into combat the major
                        military powers. We can no longer separate the traditional issues of war and
                        peace from the new global questions of justice, equity, and human
                        rights.</p>
                    <pb n="172" facs="0213" xml:id="pg_172"/>
                    <p>It is a new world, but America should not fear it. It is a new world, and we
                        should help to shape it. It is a new world that calls for a new American
                        foreign policy—a policy based on constant decency in its values and on
                        optimism in our historical vision.</p>
                    <p>We can no longer have a policy solely for the industrial nations as the
                        foundation of global stability, but we must respond to the new reality of a
                        politically awakening world.</p>
                    <p>We can no longer expect that the other 150 nations will follow the dictates
                        of the powerful, but we must continue—confidently—our efforts to inspire, to
                        persuade, and to lead.</p>
                    <p>Our policy must reflect our belief that the world can hope for more than
                        simple survival and our belief that dignity and freedom are fundamental
                        spiritual requirements. Our policy must shape an international system that
                        will last longer than secret deals.</p>
                    <p>We cannot make this kind of policy by manipulation. Our policy must be open;
                        it must be candid; it must be one of constructive global involvement,
                        resting on five cardinal principles.</p>
                    <p>I’ve tried to make these premises clear to the American people since last
                        January. Let me review what we have been doing and discuss what we intend to
                        do.</p>
                    <p>First, we have reaffirmed America’s commitment to human rights as a
                        fundamental tenet of our foreign policy. In ancestry, religion, color, place
                        of origin, and cultural background, we Americans are as diverse a nation as
                        the world has even seen. No common mystique of blood or soil unites us. What
                        draws us together, perhaps more than anything else, is a belief in human
                        freedom. We want the world to know that our Nation stands for more than
                        financial prosperity.</p>
                    <p>This does not mean that we can conduct our foreign policy by rigid moral
                        maxims. We live in a world that is imperfect and which will always be
                        imperfect—a world that is complex and confused and which will always be
                        complex and confused.</p>
                    <p>I understand fully the limits of moral suasion. We have no illusion that
                        changes will come easily or soon. But I also believe that it is a mistake to
                        undervalue the power of words and of the ideas that words embody. In our own
                        history, that power has ranged from Thomas Paine’s “Common Sense” to Martin
                        Luther King, Jr.’s “I Have a Dream.”</p>
                    <p>In the life of the human spirit, words <hi rend="italic">are</hi> action,
                        much more so than many of us may realize who live in countries where freedom
                        of expression is taken for granted. The leaders of totalitarian nations
                        understand this very well. The proof is that words are precisely the action
                        for which dissidents in those countries are being persecuted.</p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, we can already see dramatic, worldwide advances in the
                        protection of the individual from the arbitrary power of the state. <pb
                            n="173" facs="0214" xml:id="pg_173"/>For us to ignore this trend would
                        be to lose influence and moral authority in the world. To lead it will be to
                        regain the moral stature that we once had.</p>
                    <p>The great democracies are not free because we are strong and prosperous. I
                        believe we are strong and influential and prosperous because we are
                        free.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the world today, in free nations and in totalitarian countries as
                        well, there is a preoccupation with the subject of human freedom, human
                        rights. And I believe it is incumbent on us in this country to keep that
                        discussion, that debate, that contention alive. No other country is as
                        well-qualified as we to set an example. We have our own shortcomings and
                        faults, and we should strive constantly and with courage to make sure that
                        we are legitimately proud of what we have.</p>
                    <p>Second, we’ve moved deliberately to reinforce the bonds among our
                        democracies. In our recent meetings in London, we agreed to widen our
                        economic cooperation, to promote free trade, to strengthen the world’s
                        monetary system, to seek ways of avoiding nuclear proliferation.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d40fn3">See <ref target="#d38">Document 38</ref>.</note> We
                        prepared constructive proposals for the forthcoming meetings on North-South
                        problems of poverty, development, and global well-being. And we agreed on
                        joint efforts to reinforce and to modernize our common defense.</p>
                    <p>You may be interested in knowing that at this <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> meeting, for the first time in more than 25 years, all
                        members are democracies. Even more important, all of us reaffirmed our basic
                        optimism in the future of the democratic system. Our spirit of confidence is
                        spreading. Together, our democracies can help to shape the wider
                        architecture of global cooperation.</p>
                    <p>Third, we’ve moved to engage the Soviet Union in a joint effort to halt the
                        strategic arms race. This race is not only dangerous, it’s morally
                        deplorable. We must put an end to it.</p>
                    <p>I know it will not be easy to reach agreements. Our goal is to be fair to
                        both sides, to produce reciprocal stability, parity, and security. We desire
                        a freeze on further modernization and production of weapons and a
                        continuing, substantial reduction of strategic nuclear weapons as well. We
                        want a comprehensive ban on all nuclear testing, a prohibition against all
                        chemical warfare, no attack capability against space satellites, and arms
                        limitations in the Indian Ocean.</p>
                    <p>We hope that we can take joint steps with all nations toward a final
                        agreement eliminating nuclear weapons completely from our arsenals of death.
                        We will persist in this effort.</p>
                    <pb n="174" facs="0215" xml:id="pg_174"/>
                    <p>Now, I believe in détente with the Soviet Union. To me it means progress
                        toward peace. But the effects of détente should not be limited to our own
                        two countries alone. We hope to persuade the Soviet Union that one country
                        cannot impose its system of society upon another, either through direct
                        military intervention or through the use of a client state’s military force,
                        as was the case with Cuban intervention in Angola.</p>
                    <p>Cooperation also implies obligation. We hope that the Soviet Union will join
                        with us and other nations in playing a larger role in aiding the developing
                        world, for common aid efforts will help us build a bridge of mutual
                        confidence in one another.</p>
                    <p>Fourth, we are taking deliberate steps to improve the chances of lasting
                        peace in the Middle East. Through wide-ranging consultation with leaders of
                        the countries involved—Israel, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt—we have found some
                        areas of agreement and some movement toward consensus. The negotiations must
                        continue.</p>
                    <p>Through my own public comments, I’ve also tried to suggest a more flexible
                        framework for the discussion of the three key issues which have so far been
                        so intractable: the nature of a comprehensive peace—what is peace; what does
                        it mean to the Israelis; what does it mean to their Arab neighbors;
                        secondly, the relationship between security and borders—how can the dispute
                        over border delineations be established and settled with a feeling of
                        security on both sides; and the issue of the Palestinian homeland.</p>
                    <p>The historic friendship that the United States has with Israel is not
                        dependent on domestic politics in either nation; it’s derived from our
                        common respect for human freedom and from a common search for permanent
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>We will continue to promote a settlement which all of us need. Our own policy
                        will not be affected by changes in leadership in any of the countries in the
                        Middle East. Therefore, we expect Israel and her neighbors to continue to be
                        bound by United Nations Resolutions 242 and 338,<note n="4" xml:id="d40fn4">
                            <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Security Council Resolution 242,

                            East.</note> which they have previously accepted.</p>
                    <p>This may be the most propitious time for a genuine settlement since the
                        beginning of the Arab-Israeli conflict almost 30 years ago. To let this
                        opportunity pass could mean disaster not only for the Middle East but,
                        perhaps, for the international political and economic order as well.</p>
                    <pb n="175" facs="0216" xml:id="pg_175"/>
                    <p>And fifth, we are attempting, even at the risk of some friction with our
                        friends, to reduce the danger of nuclear proliferation and the worldwide
                        spread of conventional weapons.</p>
                    <p>At the recent summit, we set in motion an international effort to determine
                        the best ways of harnessing nuclear energy for peaceful use while reducing
                        the risks that its products will be diverted to the making of
                        explosives.</p>
                    <p>We’ve already completed a comprehensive review of our own policy on arms

                        arms sales is inimical to peace and destructive of the economic development
                        of the poorer countries.</p>
                    <p>We will, as a matter of national policy now in our country, seek to reduce
                        the annual dollar volume of arms sales, to restrict the transfer of advanced
                        weapons, and to reduce the extent of our coproduction arrangements about
                        weapons with foreign states. And just as important, we are trying to get
                        other nations, both free and otherwise, to join us in this effort.</p>
                    <p>But all of this that I’ve described is just the beginning. It’s a beginning
                        aimed towards a clear goal: to create a wider framework of international
                        cooperation suited to the new and rapidly changing historical
                        circumstances.</p>
                    <p>We will cooperate more closely with the newly influential countries in Latin
                        America, Africa, and Asia. We need their friendship and cooperation in a
                        common effort as the structure of world power changes.</p>
                    <p>More than 100 years ago, Abraham Lincoln said that our Nation could not exist
                        half slave and half free.<note n="6" xml:id="d40fn6">Reference is to
                            Lincoln’s “House Divided” speech, which he delivered in Springfield,
                            Illinois in June 1858, upon accepting the Illinois Republican Party’s
                            nomination for the Illinois U.S. Senate seat. Lincoln subsequently lost
                            the election to the incumbent, Democrat Stephen Douglas.</note> We know
                        a peaceful world cannot long exist one-third rich and two-thirds hungry.</p>
                    <p>Most nations share our faith that, in the long run, expanded and equitable
                        trade will best help the developing countries to help themselves. But the
                        immediate problems of hunger, disease, illiteracy, and repression are here
                        now.</p>
                    <pb n="176" facs="0217" xml:id="pg_176"/>
                    <p>The Western democracies, the <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> nations,
                        and the developed Communist countries can cooperate through existing
                        international institutions in providing more effective aid. This is an
                        excellent alternative to war.</p>
                    <p>We have a special need for cooperation and consultation with other nations in
                        this hemisphere—to the north and to the south. We do not need another
                        slogan. Although these are our close friends and neighbors, our links with
                        them are the same links of equality that we forge for the rest of the world.
                        We will be dealing with them as part of a new, worldwide mosaic of global,
                        regional, and bilateral relations.</p>
                    <p>It’s important that we make progress toward normalizing relations with the
                        People’s Republic of China. We see the American and Chinese relationship as
                        a central element of our global policy and China as a key force for global
                        peace. We wish to cooperate closely with the creative Chinese people on the
                        problems that confront all mankind. And we hope to find a formula which can
                        bridge some of the difficulties that still separate us.</p>
                    <p>Finally, let me say that we are committed to a peaceful resolution of the
                        crisis in southern Africa. The time has come for the principle of majority
                        rule to be the basis for political order, recognizing that in a democratic
                        system the rights of the minority must also be protected.</p>
                    <p>To be peaceful, change must come promptly. The United States is determined to
                        work together with our European allies and with the concerned African States
                        to shape a congenial international framework for the rapid and progressive
                        transformation of southern African society and to help protect it from
                        unwarranted outside interference.</p>
                    <p>Let me conclude by summarizing: Our policy is based on an historical vision
                        of America’s role. Our policy is derived from a larger view of global
                        change. Our policy is rooted in our moral values, which never change. Our
                        policy is reinforced by our material wealth and by our military power. Our
                        policy is designed to serve mankind. And it is a policy that I hope will
                        make you proud to be Americans.</p>
                    <p>Thank you.</p>

                        <p>As the Administration of President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                                >Carter</persName> has reviewed the major issues currently on the
                            North-South agenda and begun to establish its own set of priorities, it
                            has found one issue slighted in all the talk about a new international
                            economic order. The issue has various names: the “absolute poverty”
                            problem, the problem of “basic human needs,” the problem of “the
                            forgotten forty percent.” Whatever we choose to call it, it is the
                            problem of those one billion persons living at the razor’s edge of
                            existence. Again, as President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                                >Carter</persName> noted at Notre Dame, most na<pb n="178"

                            longer run, expanded trade will best help developing countries to help
                            themselves. But the immediate problems of hunger, disease, high infant
                            mortality, illiteracy and stunted “life chances” <hi rend="italic"
                                >cannot</hi> and <hi rend="italic">should not</hi> be expected to
                            await a longer-run answer.</p>
                        <p>If our nations did not have the knowledge and the resources needed to
                            overcome these problems of meeting basic human needs within the next two
                            decades, perhaps we could excuse ourselves from making any special
                            effort to overcome the so-called “absolute poverty” problem.</p>
                        <p>But the knowledge of the development process and the knowledge of how to
                            construct a viable approach to the resolution of this acute poverty
                            problem is now within our grasp. What is missing is the joint
                            willingness of developed and developing countries to recognize that the
                            North-South dialogue is about <hi rend="italic">human beings</hi> as
                            well as nation-states, and that “equality of opportunity” for a richer
                            and more meaningful life only makes sense as it applies to <hi
                                rend="italic">people</hi>.</p>
                        <p>In order to give proper focus to this aspect of the North-South dialogue,
                            the United States proposes to proceed as follows. First, we, ourselves,
                            will develop specific programs to overcome the absolute poverty problem
                            globally. We have already determined the essential ingredients and
                            objectives of such a program. It must deal with:</p>
                        <p>—Basic education, particularly in rural areas;</p>
                        <p>—Essential health services, again with emphasis on rural areas;</p>
                        <p>—increased food production and the provision of adequate nutrition;</p>
                        <p>—clean water.</p>
                        <p>At the June meeting of the <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss>, we
                            plan to ask the member countries to jointly cooperate with us in

                            then to develop a joint effort that will effectively tackle the problem
                            of meeting the basic human needs of the world’s poorest billion people.
                            We recognize that this effort will require a substantial commitment of
                            political will and resources on the part of all countries who choose to

                            continue to be available as a forum for such discussions. In the

                            recognized experts to monitor the implementation of the ideas being
                            discussed here and to keep our governments abreast of the opportunities
                            for further cooperation. As a part of this effort, the experts might
                            prepare for the North-South discussions which we hope will come about by
                            developing an overall program to meet basic needs.</p>

                    <p>Because you have chosen to be active in many areas of foreign policy during
                        your first year in office, there will evolve in the near future a number of
                        critical decisions that will have to be made. And each of these decisions
                        will be difficult politically and will have domestic implications that will
                        require the support and understanding of the American people and the
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>The most significant of these decisions relate to specific countries and/or
                        areas of the world. As best I can determine, those decisions which will
                        require action on our part and/or the political support of the people and
                        Congress are:</p>
                    <p>—The Middle East</p>
                    <p>—<gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II</p>
                    <p>—AFRICA</p>
                    <p>—Normalization of relations with Cuba and Vietnam</p>
                    <p>—Treaty with Panama</p>
                    <p>—Withdrawal of troops from Korea<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2">The President

                    <pb n="180" facs="0221" xml:id="pg_180"/>
                    <p>It is my own contention that this confluence of foreign policy initiatives
                        and decisions will require a comprehensive and well coordinated domestic
                        political strategy if our policies are to gain the understanding and support
                        of the American people and the Congress.</p>
                    <p>It is important that we understand the political dimensions of the challenges
                        we face on these specific issues:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">There is a limited public understanding of most foreign
                            policy issues</hi>. This is certainly the case with <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II and the Middle East. This is not
                        altogether bad as it provides us an opportunity to present these issues to
                        the public in a politically advantageous way. At the same time, most of
                        these issues assume a simplistic political coloration. If you favor
                        normalization of relations with Cuba or Vietnam, you are a “liberal”; if you
                        oppose normalization with these same countries, you are “conservative”.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">To the extent that the issues we are dealing with have a
                            “liberal” or “conservative” connotation, our position on these
                            particular issues is consistently “liberal”</hi>. We must do what we can
                        to present these issues to the public in a non-ideological way and not allow
                        them to undermine your own image as a moderate-conservative.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d42fn3">Immediately following this point, the President wrote:
                            “To challenge Soviets for influence is ’conservative.’”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Congressional support in some form is needed to
                            accomplish most of your foreign policy objectives</hi>. A modest amount
                        of time invested in consultation with key members of Congress will go a long
                        way toward winning the support of Congress on many issues. Whereas members
                        of Congress do not mind—and sometimes relish—a confrontation with the
                        President on some local project or matter of obvious direct benefit to their
                        district or state, very few wish to differ publicly with the President on a
                        foreign policy matter.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">We have very little control over the schedule and
                            time-frame in which most of these foreign policy issues will be
                            resolved</hi>. Consequently, a continuing problem and challenge will be
                        to attempt to separate out the key foreign policy issues from domestic
                        programs so the two will not become politically entwined in the Congress.
                        This dictates a continuing focus on the historical bipartisan nature of U.S.
                        foreign policy so the Republican members of Congress will be less tempted to
                        demagogue these issues during the 1978 elections.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Conservatives are much better organized than liberals
                            and will generally oppose our foreign policy initiatives</hi>. To
                        effectively counter conservative opposition, we will have to take the
                        initiative in providing coordination of our resources and political
                        leadership. Our resources at present are considerable, but they are
                        scattered among a variety of <pb n="181" facs="0222" xml:id="pg_181"/>groups
                        and institutions. To the extent our policy goals are being pursued, they are
                        being pursued unilaterally by groups and people and without coordination.
                        The very fact that your administration is active simultaneously in many
                        areas of foreign policy dictates a comprehensive, long-range political
                        strategy for winning the support of the American people and the Congress. To
                        accomplish this goal, I would recommend a three step process:</p>
                    <p>I. <hi rend="italic">CONSULTATION</hi>. Early consultation with Congress and
                        interested/affected constituent groups is critical to the political success
                        of these policies. In almost every instance, Senate ratification of a treaty
                        and/or military and economic support which requires the support of Congress
                        will be required to accomplish these foreign policy objectives.
                        Consequently, it is important that we invest a small amount of time on a
                        continuing basis in consultation with members of Congress and
                            groups/organizations.<note n="4" xml:id="d42fn4">Following this

                    <p>II. <hi rend="italic">PUBLIC EDUCATION</hi>. Public understanding of most of
                        these issues is very limited. To the extent these issues are understood
                        and/or perceived by the general public, they are viewed in very simplistic
                        terms. This is a mixed blessing. On one hand, it becomes necessary to
                        explain complex issues to the American people. On the other hand, because
                        these issues are not well understood, a tremendous opportunity exists to
                        educate the public to a certain point of view. In the final analysis, I
                        suspect that we could demonstrate a direct correlation between the trust the
                        American people have for their President and the degree to which they are
                        willing to trust that President’s judgement on complex issues of foreign
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>In terms of public education, we have a tremendous number of resources. They
                        include:</p>
                    <p>—Fireside chats</p>
                    <p>—Town meetings</p>
                    <p>—Speaking opportunities for President, Vice-President, First Family, Cabinet,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>—Public service media opportunities</p>
                    <p>—Groups outside government who support particular policies</p>
                    <p>—Democratic National Committee</p>
                    <p>—Mailing lists</p>
                    <p>—Etc.</p>
                    <p>III. <hi rend="italic">POLITICAL PLANNING AND COORDINATION</hi>. Once foreign
                        policy goals are established, it is critical that political strategies in
                        support of those goals be developed and implemented. And it is important
                        that the resources available to the Administration—both inside and <pb

                        coordinated and used in a way that is supportive of these objectives.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">I have attempted in this memorandum to outline the first

                    <p>On June 6, 1977, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cyrus
                            Vance</persName> addressed the Commission on Security and Cooperation in
                        Europe in order to discuss the administration’s approach to the forthcoming
                            <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss> Review Conference, scheduled to
                        take place in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in October 1977. <persName
                            corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> asserted that he wanted to underline
                        the “continuing importance” the <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> administration placed on the implementation of the
                        Final Act of the Helsinki Conference (see <ref target="#d4fn7">footnote 7,
                            Document 4</ref>):</p>
                    <p>“You are fully aware of this Administration’s interest in promoting more
                        stable and mutually beneficial relations between the peoples of East and
                        West. The Helsinki Final Act provides one framework for such
                        cooperation.</p>
                    <p>“You are also aware of our commitment to honor and promote the rights of
                        individuals, the human rights of all peoples, no matter what their political
                        or social origins and affiliations. The Conference on Security and
                        Cooperation in Europe has provided a multilateral mechanism through which to
                        pursue these aims.”</p>
                    <p>After praising the continued cooperation between the executive and
                        legislative branches concerning the multiple issues related to the Helsinki
                        Accords, <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> then stated the
                        administration’s objectives for the upcoming meeting:</p>
                    <p>“—We seek full implementation of all the commitments contained in the
                        Helsinki Final Act. None can be called more binding, more vital, than
                        others. All three of the so-called baskets are important.</p>
                    <p>“—We seek incremental improvements in relations between East and West on all
                        the fronts surveyed at Helsinki: political, economic, scientific, cultural,
                        security, and humanitarian.</p>
                    <pb n="183" facs="0224" xml:id="pg_183"/>
                    <p>“—We seek to move forward on all these fronts simultaneously: the freer flow
                        of people and ideas is as important to long-term security and cooperation
                        as, for example, advance notice of major military maneuvers; the
                        humanitarian pledges at Helsinki are as important as, say, the promises of
                        greater commercial cooperation.</p>
                    <p>“—There will be consideration of new proposals. But we must not be diverted
                        from assessment of how fully the specific undertakings of Helsinki have been
                        carried out by all the signatories.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> referenced the ambitiousness
                        of the agenda, conceding that differences in “understanding and priority”
                        might exist among participants. Although discussion of differences would be
                        desirable, he asserted that such discussions could not “serve as a diversion
                        or a cloak for inaction” in terms of reviewing progress made and
                        anticipating subsequent implementation of other goals. He then
                        continued:</p>
                    <p>“At Belgrade we will assess on the spot how best to be effective and
                        persuasive in pursuing our objectives. Between public diplomacy and quiet
                        diplomacy, we will strive for maximum practical impact. We will avoid
                        grandiose new proposals that have little chance of being acceptable.
                        Propaganda ploys, debating points have no place in our strategy. We will
                        state our goals and our assessments clearly, without polemics. It would
                        serve no one’s interests if such serious and far-reaching questions were
                        dealt with in anything other than a serious and straightforward manner.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> concluded his remarks by
                        noting that the administration’s report on the implementation of the Final
                        Act, a copy of which he had provided to the Commission, detailed and
                        assessed the steps the United States had taken. He underscored the reality
                        that no nation’s record “is perfect,” and added that the United States would
                        accept “constructive criticism” of its own policy. Referencing his April 30
                        Law Day address, which he delivered at the University of Georgia (see <ref
                            target="#d37">Document 37</ref>), <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                            >Vance</persName> stated that action in the cause of human rights “is a
                        matter for informed and careful judgment. No mechanistic formula produces an
                        automatic answer.” He concluded:</p>
                    <p>“So it will be in our decisions about working for implementation of the
                        commitments contained in the Helsinki Final Act, those dealing with our
                        political, economic, and military relations, as well as those affecting
                        human rights.</p>
                    <p>“Respect for the undertakings solemnly accepted at <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1"
                            >CSCE</gloss> is an effort to which our government is firmly committed,
                        in the full knowledge that the pursuit of security and cooperation in Europe
                        poses a test of our perseverance as much as of our ideals. I am confident
                        that we will, together, persevere.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic"

                        World</p>
                    <p>In the last several months, I’ve undertaken two extended foreign trips on
                        behalf of the President to Europe and Japan.<note n="2" xml:id="d44fn2"

                            trip to Europe.</note> The more I travel, and the more nations I visit,
                        the more I come to believe that the peoples of the world are not really so
                        different—that all of us dream the same dreams for our children and that the
                        real key to peace and cooperation in the world lies in better understanding
                        between people. Diplomats and heads of state and elected officials must play
                        a role, but we should never underestimate the power of ideas and education
                        and greater understanding to break down the barriers of suspicion and fear
                        that too often separate the nations of the world.</p>
                    <p>Your programs in the school system, on television, the lectures and seminars
                        you hold, your model U.N. conference for students are all an important part
                        of that effort. And I’m particularly pleased to see that you’re joining
                        together with a number of groups involved in international relations in a
                        new World Affairs Center here in San Francisco, and I wish you every success
                        in that venture. And so the contributions of an organization such as yours
                        toward increased understanding in the world are really crucial, not only to
                        the foreign policy efforts of this nation but to the search for peace.</p>
                    <p>With the words of his Inaugural Address, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> identified at the very outset of
                        his Administration the guiding spirit of this nation’s foreign policy:</p>
                    <p>Our nation can be strong abroad only if it is strong at home, and we know
                        that the best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here
                        that our democratic system is worthy of emulation. To be true to ourselves,
                        we must be true to others.</p>
                    <p>And he elaborated on the basic premises of our relations with other nations
                        in his speech at Notre Dame<note n="3" xml:id="d44fn3">See <ref
                                target="#d40">Document 40</ref>.</note> this May:</p>
                    <pb n="185" facs="0226" xml:id="pg_185"/>
                    <p>—Our policy must be rooted in our people’s basic commitment to human
                        rights.</p>
                    <p>—Our policy must be based on close cooperation with the Western industrial
                        democracies. With them we share basic values; with them also we share a
                        recognition that global problems cannot be solved without close cooperation
                        among us. This was the message the President had me take to Europe and Japan
                        in the first week of the Administration, and this was the spirit which
                        guided the President and his colleagues at the London summit last
                            month.<note n="4" xml:id="d44fn4">See <ref target="#d38">Document
                                38</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>—Our policy must seek to improve relations with the Soviet Union and China.
                        It must do so in a balanced and reciprocal way, while we maintain a strong
                        defense.</p>
                    <p>—Our policy must recognize that the cleavage between North and South is as
                        important as between East and West. We must reach out to the world’s
                        developing nations, seeking to narrow the gap between rich and poor.</p>
                    <p>—Finally, our policy must provide incentives for all nations to rise above
                        ideology or narrow conceptions of self-interest and work together to resolve
                        regional conflicts and to meet global problems that confront all people.</p>
                    <p>As an Administration, we are only five months old. However, these months have
                        been a period of intense activity. We are committed to shaping effective
                        policies that truly reflect America’s values and objectives, and we are
                        committed to implementing policies with other nations so as to shape a more
                        peaceful and stable world.</p>
                    <p>One of our first tasks has been to insure that our foreign policy reflects
                        the commitment to basic human rights that we, as Americans, share. That
                        commitment to the inherent dignity of the individual is at the heart of the
                        American tradition. From it flows the democratic liberties that we
                        cherish—such as the right to worship freely; freedom of speech, of the
                        press, of assembly, and due process of law. Those are the basic strengths of
                        our nation.</p>
                    <p>We have survived as a free nation because we have remained committed to the
                        defense of fundamental moral values we cherish as a people. And unless our
                        foreign policy reflects those values it will not earn the support of the
                        American people. Without that support, no foreign policy—no matter how
                        brilliantly conceived—can succeed.</p>
                    <p>I believe we have restored that commitment to human rights. I am proud that
                        the United States today stands among those who uphold human rights and human
                        dignity in the world. I am proud that no foreign leader today has any doubt
                        that the United States condemns tor<pb n="186" facs="0227" xml:id="pg_186"
                        />ture, political imprisonment, and repression by any government, anywhere
                        in the world. We believe that basic human rights transcend ideology. We
                        believe all nations, regardless of political systems, must respect those
                        rights.</p>
                    <p>Just as respect for human rights is central to our foreign policy values, so
                        progress toward a just and lasting Middle East settlement is essential to
                        the prospect of a more peaceful world. The President has asked me to
                        describe what we are trying to do to achieve peace in the Middle East. We
                        want the American people to have the fullest possible understanding of our
                        approach, for your support is crucial to its success.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>With the exception of the meeting with President Asad which was held in
                        Geneva, I have participated in all of them and have sensed these leaders’
                        great desire for peace and their longing for the benefits that peace can
                        bring to nations too long mobilized for war. Yet at the same time, we also
                        found deep fears and suspicions which must be overcome if peace is to be
                        achieved in that strategic and troubled region of the world.</p>
                    <p>A genuine and lasting peace in the Middle East is of essential interest to
                        all Americans. Conflict there carries the threat of a global confrontation
                        and runs the risk of nuclear war. As we have seen, war in the Middle East
                        has profound economic consequences. It can, and has, damaged the economies
                        of the entire world. It has been a tragedy for the nations of the region.
                        Even short of war, continued confrontation encourages radicalization and
                        instability.</p>
                    <p>Genuine peace is needed by all parties to the conflict. The Arab nations need
                        peace. Israel, above all, has a profound interest in peace; there is no
                        question about that.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Israel’s Survival</p>
                    <p>For almost three decades, Israel has borne the burden of constant war. More
                        than half its entire budget is dedicated to defense. Its citizens <pb
                            n="187" facs="0228" xml:id="pg_187"/>bear the highest average tax burden
                        in the world—more than 60 percent of their income goes for taxes.</p>
                    <p>And yet, at the same time, this valiant nation has managed to create a
                        miracle in the desert. With ingenuity, hard work, and skill it has created a
                        land that could be a model for economic development and for political
                        liberty to be emulated throughout the Middle East. Democracy has thrived in
                        Israel despite the kind of adversity that has crushed freedom in other
                        lands.</p>
                    <p>And yet, what of the future? Is it a future in which Israel’s three million
                        people try, by force of arms alone, to hold out against the hostility and
                        growing power of the Arab world? Or can a process of reconciliation be
                        started—a process in which peace protects Israel’s security, a peace in
                        which the urge for revenge and recrimination is replaced by mutual
                        recognition and respect?</p>
                    <p>America has a special responsibility and a special opportunity to help bring
                        about this kind of peace. This comes about first of all because of our
                        unique and profound relationship with the State of Israel since its creation
                        more than a generation ago. Our sense of shared values and purposes means
                        that, for Americans, the question of Israel’s survival is not a political
                        question but rather stands as a moral imperative of our foreign policy.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Key Elements for an Agreement</p>
                    <p>And yet, our special relationship with Israel has not been directed against
                        any other country. We have been able to enjoy the friendship of much of the
                        Arab world, where we and our close allies have important interests.</p>
                    <p>It is precisely because of our close ties with both Israel and her Arab
                        neighbors that we are uniquely placed to promote the search for peace, to
                        work for an improved understanding of each side’s legitimate concerns, and
                        to help them work out what we hope will be a basis for negotiation leading
                        to a final peace in the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>When this Administration entered office on January 20, we found that the
                        situation in the Middle East called for a new approach. The step-by-step
                        diplomacy of our predecessors had defused the immediate tensions produced by
                        the war in 1973. But it was also evident that it would be increasingly
                        difficult to achieve small diplomatic concessions when the ultimate shape of
                        a peace agreement remained obscure. At the same time, it was unlikely that
                        an agreement on a lasting peace could be achieved at one stroke.</p>
                    <p>U.N. Security Council Resolution 242, which is supported by all the parties,
                        provides a basis for the negotiations which are required if <pb n="188"
                            facs="0229" xml:id="pg_188"/>there is to be a settlement.<note n="7"
                            xml:id="d44fn7">See <ref target="#d40fn4">footnote 4, Document
                            40</ref>.</note> But Resolution 242 does not by itself provide all that
                        is required. We, therefore, decided to work with the parties concerned to
                        outline the overall framework for an enduring peace. Our concept was to use
                        this framework as the basis for a phased negotiation and implementation of
                        specific steps toward peace.</p>
                    <p>A major impediment to this approach lay in the fact that the positions of all
                        sides were frozen. The words and phrases used by the parties had become
                        encrusted with the fallout of countless diplomatic battles.</p>
                    <p>We have tried to regain momentum in this process. We have encouraged Arabs
                        and Israelis to begin thinking again seriously about the elements of peace
                        and not to remain committed to particular words and formulations.</p>
                    <p>To this end the President has tried to describe our understanding of what the
                        key elements of an overall framework for an agreement might be:</p>
                    <p>—A commitment to a genuine and lasting peace demonstrated by concrete acts to
                        normalize relations among the countries of the area;</p>
                    <p>—The establishment of borders for Israel which are recognized by all and
                        which can be kept secure;</p>
                    <p>—A fair solution to the problem of the Palestinians.</p>
                    <p>The President has set forth these elements not to dictate a peace or to
                        impose our views but to stimulate fresh thought.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Relations Among Middle East Countries</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> has gone further
                        than any of his predecessors to stress with Arab leaders the essential point
                        that peace must mean more than merely an end to hostilities, stating as he
                        did in Clinton, Massachusetts, last March:</p>
                    <p>. . . the first prerequisite of a lasting peace is the recognition of Israel
                        by her neighbors, Israel’s right to exist, Israel’s right to exist
                        permanently, Israel’s right to exist in peace. That means that over a period
                        of months or years that the borders between Israel and Syria, Israel and
                        Lebanon, Israel and Jordan, Israel and Egypt must be opened up to travel, to
                        tourism, to cultural exchange, to trade, so that no matter who the leaders
                        might be in those countries, the people themselves will have formed a mutual
                        understanding and comprehension and a sense of a common purpose to avoid the
                        repetitious wars and death that have afflicted that region so long. That’s
                        the first prerequisite of peace.<note n="8" xml:id="d44fn8">See <ref

                    </p>
                    <p>We have found that the Arab leaders did not insist that this kind of peace is
                        something that only future generations could consider. Some <pb n="189"

                    </p>
                    <p>So we believe that we have made some progress in getting Arab leaders to
                        recognize Israel’s right to exist and to recognize—however reluctantly—that
                        this commitment is essential to a genuine peace; that peace must be
                        structured in such a way that it can survive even if some leaders were to
                        nurture aims to destroy Israel. Still, we have a long way to go. The Arabs
                        have been insistent that Israel withdraw from the territories it occupied in
                        the 1967 war. We have made clear our view that Israel should not be asked to
                        withdraw unless it can secure, in return, real peace from its neighbors.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Borders and Security Arrangements</p>
                    <p>The question of withdrawal is, in essence, the question of borders. For peace
                        to be enduring, borders must be inviolable. Nations must feel secure behind
                        their borders. Borders must be recognized by all.</p>
                    <p>A crucial dilemma has been how to provide borders that are both secure and
                        acceptable to all. It is understandable that Israel, having fought a war in
                        every decade since its birth, wants borders that can be defended as easily
                        as possible. But no borders will be secure if neighboring countries do not
                        accept them.</p>
                    <p>The problem is that borders that might afford Israel the maximum security in
                        military terms would not be accepted as legitimate by Israel’s neighbors.
                        Borders that Israel’s neighbors would recognize, Israel has not been willing
                        to accept as forming an adequate line of defense.</p>
                    <p>For this reason, the President has tried to separate the two issues. On the
                        one hand, there must be recognized borders. But, in addition, there could be
                        separate lines of defense or other measures that could enhance Israel’s
                        security. The arrangements in the Sinai and in the Golan Heights provide
                        models of how Israel’s security might be enhanced until confidence in a
                        lasting peace can be fully developed.</p>
                    <p>We would urge all the parties to think realistically about security
                        arrangements to reduce the fear of surprise attack, to make acts of
                        aggression difficult if not impossible, and to limit the military forces
                        that would confront one another in sensitive areas.</p>
                    <p>This approach recognizes the fact that there is a profound asymmetry in what
                        the two sides in the Middle East are seeking. On the one hand, a principal
                        Arab concern is to regain lost territory. On the other, <pb n="190"
                            facs="0231" xml:id="pg_190"/>Israel wishes peace and recognition.
                        Territory is tangible and once ceded difficult to regain short of war.
                        Peace, on the other hand, can be ephemeral. Peaceful intentions can change
                        overnight unless a solid foundation of cooperation and a firm pattern of
                        reinforcing relationships can be established to insure that all have a stake
                        in continuing tranquillity.</p>
                    <p>We believe that separating the imperatives of security from the requirement
                        of recognized borders is an important advance toward reconciling the
                        differences between the two sides. It is in this way that Israel could
                        return to approximately the borders that existed prior to the war of 1967,
                        albeit with minor modifications as negotiated among the parties, and yet
                        retain security lines or other arrangements that would insure Israel’s
                        safety as full confidence developed in a comprehensive peace. Thus, with
                        borders explicitly recognized and buttressed by security measures and with
                        the process of peace unfolding, Israel’s security would be greater than it
                        is today.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Future of the Palestinians</p>
                    <p>A further major issue is that of the future of the Palestinian people. It has
                        been the source of continuing tragedy in the Middle East. There are two
                        prerequisites for a lasting peace in this regard.</p>
                    <p>—First, there must be a demonstrated willingness on the part of the
                        Palestinians to live in peace alongside Israel.</p>
                    <p>—Second, the Palestinians must be given a stake in peace so that they will
                        turn away from the violence of the past and toward a future in which they
                        can express their legitimate political aspirations peacefully.</p>
                    <p>Thus, if the Palestinians are willing to exist in peace and are prepared to
                        demonstrate that willingness by recognizing Israel’s right to exist in
                        peace, the President has made clear that, in the context of a peace
                        settlement, we believe the Palestinians should be given a chance to shed
                        their status as homeless refugees and to partake fully of the benefits of
                        peace in the Middle East, including the possibility of some arrangement for
                        a Palestinian homeland or entity—preferably in association with Jordan.</p>
                    <p>How this would be accomplished and the exact character of such an entity is,
                        of course, something that would have to be decided by the parties themselves
                        in the course of negotiation. However, the President has suggested that the
                        viability of this concept and the security of the region might be enhanced
                        if this involved an association with Jordan. But I emphasize that the
                        specifics are for the parties themselves to decide.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Necessity of Negotiating</p>
                    <p>This leads me to a further crucial aspect of our approach—the necessity of
                        direct negotiations among the parties concerned. We cannot <pb n="191"
                            facs="0232" xml:id="pg_191"/>conceive of genuine peace existing between
                        countries who will not talk to one another. If they are prepared for peace,
                        the first proof is a willingness to negotiate their differences.</p>
                    <p>This is why we believe it is so important to proceed with the holding of a
                        Geneva conference this year. That conference provides the forum for these
                        nations to begin the working out of these problems together directly,
                        face-to-face. We have a continuing objective to convene such a conference
                        before the end of this year.</p>
                    <p>Underlying this entire effort to promote the process of negotiation is our
                        determination to maintain the military security of Israel. There must be no
                        question in anyone’s mind that the United States will do what is necessary
                        to insure the adequacy of Israel’s military posture and its capacity for
                        self-defense.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that America has a special responsibility in this regard. In
                        fact, in promulgating our overall policy to curb the international traffic
                        in arms, the President specifically directed the government that we will
                        honor our historic responsibilities to assure the security of the State of
                        Israel. Let there be no doubt about this commitment by this
                        Administration.</p>
                    <p>We do not intend to use our military aid as pressure on Israel. If we have
                        differences over military aid—and we may have some—it will be on military
                        grounds or economic grounds but not political grounds. If we have
                        differences over diplomatic strategy—and that could happen—we will work this
                        out on a political level. We will not alter our commitment to Israel’s
                        military security.</p>
                    <p>Let me conclude by saying that we hope the concepts I have been discussing
                        here today—concepts which the President has advanced at talks with Israeli
                        and Arab leaders—will stimulate them to develop ideas of their own. We
                        realize that peace cannot be imposed from the outside, and we do not intend
                        to present the parties with a plan or a timetable or a map. Peace can only
                        come from a genuine recognition by all parties that their interests are
                        served by reconciliation and not by war, by faith in the future rather than
                        bitterness over the past.</p>
                    <p>America can try to help establish the basis of trust necessary for peace. We
                        can try to improve the atmosphere for communication. We can offer ideas, but
                        we cannot, in the end, determine whether peace or war is the fate of the
                        Middle East. That can only be decided by Israel and her Arab neighbors.</p>
                    <p>We believe that both sides want peace. As the President has said [at Notre
                        Dame on May 22]:</p>
                    <p>This may be the most propitious time for a genuine settlement since the
                        beginning of the Arab-Israeli conflict almost 30 years ago. To let this
                        opportunity pass could mean disaster, not only for the Middle <pb n="192"
                            facs="0233" xml:id="pg_192"/>East, but perhaps for the international
                        political and economic order as well.</p>
                    <p>As we go forward in our mediating role, we will have to expect from time to
                        time to have differences with both sides. But these will be differences as
                        to tactics. Our overall objectives will be those that we believe are now
                        shared by all sides: A permanent and enduring peace in the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>This is obviously a difficult task and there is always the possibility of
                        failure. But it is a historic responsibility that requires the fullest
                        possible support of the American people.</p>
                    <p>I believe we have this support. And as we go through the difficult days
                        ahead, this support will sustain us. It will provide the strength we need to
                        encourage all parties to put aside their fears and put trust in their hopes
                        for a genuine and lasting Middle East peace.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">John Kennedy</persName> once described the
                        formula for peace not only in the Middle East but throughout the world, and
                        I would like to close with his words [at the U.N. on Sept. 25, 1961]:</p>
                    <p>If we all can persevere—if we can in every land and office look beyond our
                        own shores and ambitions—then surely the age will dawn in which the strong
                        are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved.<note n="10"

                        and <persName corresp="#p_DB_1">Barrie Dunsmore</persName> of the American

                        interviewed Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cyrus

                        and radio public affairs program “Issues and Answers.” During the interview,
                            <persName corresp="#p_CB_1">Clark</persName> commented that Vice
                        President <persName corresp="#p_MWF_1">Walter Mondale</persName> had stated
                        in his June 17 address to the World Affairs Council of Northern California
                        (see <ref target="#d44">Document 44</ref>) that the United States would not
                        use the threat of reducing military aid to induce the Government of Israel
                        to give up the occupied territories. Referring to the position of incoming
                        Israeli Prime Minister Menahem <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Begin</persName>
                        concerning the occupied territories, <persName corresp="#p_CB_1"
                            >Clark</persName> inquired as to whether the United States would need to
                        “apply pressure of some sort if it is going to play a significant role” in
                        securing peace in the Middle East. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                            >Vance</persName> responded:</p>
                    <pb n="193" facs="0234" xml:id="pg_193"/>
                    <p>“I’m going to answer your question, but let me say something first because
                        I’d like to sort of set this in a framework.</p>
                    <p>“When our Administration came into office, we decided that we were not merely
                        going to react to situations, but that we were going to shape an agenda of
                        items which we considered to be the highest priority and would proceed to
                        deal with those issues.</p>
                    <p>“The first of those items was that dealing with the question of regional
                        peace, which could affect, in the long run, world peace. And the Middle East
                        was one of those obvious areas which involved regional peace. Another was,
                        of course, Africa, where we’re also working.</p>
                    <p>“Secondly, we agreed that we would work to achieve progress in the arms
                        control area because of its importance not only to the big powers but to the
                        world in general, and therefore, we agreed to attack both the problem of
                        strategic arms and of conventional arms.</p>
                    <p>“Thirdly, we decided that we must work with our colleagues to try and control
                        the spread of nuclear weapons throughout the world, and we have been working
                        to that end.</p>
                    <p>“Fourthly, we decided it was of utmost importance to strengthen the alliance
                        with our allies, and the most important example of that is <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>. We have been working in that area, as
                        you well know.</p>
                    <p>“Fifthly, we decided that it was important to promote cooperation rather than
                        confrontation with the Third World. Much of what we have been doing at
                            <gloss target="#t_CIEC_1">CIEC</gloss> [Conference on International
                        Economic Cooperation], in the <gloss target="#t_OAS_1">OAS</gloss>, in the
                        meeting which I am going to be attending in the <gloss target="#t_OECD_1"
                            >OECD</gloss> [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] is
                        related to this. This is the whole range of so-called North-South problems
                        that are dealing with these terribly complicated economic relationships
                        which arise out of our relationships with the Third World.</p>
                    <p>“Next, we believe that we must seek normalization of relations with as many
                        countries as possible, because without a dialogue—a diplomatic
                        dialogue—there’s no way even to advance our own interests, let alone hear
                        what the concerns of the others are.</p>
                    <p>“And the last was, of course, the promotion of human rights.</p>
                    <p>“Now I just wanted to give you this sort of agenda of items which we have
                        been using and proceeding along during this first stage.</p>
                    <p>“Now let me return, if I might, to the question of the Middle East. I think
                        it’s too early yet to say what the foreign policy of Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BM_1">Begin</persName> is going to be. He is coming to the
                        United States, hopefully, at the end of the month of July. I think we must
                        wait until he comes and we have a chance to hear firsthand what his foreign
                        policy is, what he is prepared to do with respect to the negotiation of a
                        peace in the Middle East, before we jump to any conclusions.</p>
                    <pb n="194" facs="0235" xml:id="pg_194"/>
                    <p>“I would note that I’ve read the press in the last day or so that Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Begin</persName>’s coalition has apparently
                        endorsed a policy which says that they are prepared to enter into peace
                        negotiations without any preconditions. We will look forward to seeing Mr.
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Begin</persName> when he comes and to
                        finding out specifically what flexibility there is.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CB_1">Clark</persName>: Mr. Secretary, the Vice
                        President said flatly that we will not use the threat of reducing military
                        aid to Israel to get them to give up occupied territories.</p>
                    <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>: That’s right.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CB_1">Clark</persName>: Does that mean that we
                        would continue to sell arms to Israel, and to Arab countries to the extent
                        that they buy them from us, regardless of whether there is any progress
                        toward peace in the Middle East?</p>
                    <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>: We have urged all
                        of the parties, and I have talked with the parties myself, about the need
                        for restraint and reduction in arms sales in the area—and we will continue
                        to do so. But let there be no question: We have a deep commitment to Israel
                        that we will provide to Israel the arms which are necessary for its
                        self-defense, and we will abide by that without any question. And I don’t
                        want any lack of clarity on that point.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DB_1">Dunsmore</persName>: Well, let me put the
                        question to you this way then, sir: At the end of the 1973 war, the United
                        States went on an alert to prevent the Russians from intervening, which in
                        effect was saying we would be prepared to go to war. If there’s another war
                        in the Middle East, and it comes about, at least in part, because the
                        Israelis have not been prepared to make what we consider to be reasonable
                        concessions, would we go to war to save them?</p>
                    <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>: That is a question
                        which is an iffy question, which I am not going to answer.</p>

                        do everything that’s necessary to preserve her security and integrity,
                        should it be challenged. I think that sufficiently answers your
                        question.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DB_1">Dunsmore</persName>: It’s a cliche of the
                        Middle East that it’s up to the parties themselves to settle it, but left to
                        their own devices they’ve had four wars. Surely there must be some kind of
                        friendly persuasion that we are planning on both sides.</p>
                    <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>: We clearly feel
                        that we have a role to play here as a country which has good relationships
                        with both sides—with both Israel and her Arab neighbors. We believe that we
                        can work with the parties to try and help them find common ground. We are
                        committed to do everything within our power to bring this about.</p>

                    <p>“Whether it can be accomplished I don’t know, because the ultimate decision
                        is going to be made, and has to be made, by the parties themselves. You can
                        never have a lasting peace until it’s one agreed upon by the parties. We
                        will feel free, as I have indicated before, to make suggestions to the
                        parties as to what we believe are fair and equitable approaches to these
                        common core issues which we have talked about so many times in the past.”

                        stabilizing effect? Following are some measures for consideration:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Brezhnev Meeting:</hi> It seems evident that the idea
                        has been of persistent interest to Brezhnev, and, if he would be willing to
                        accept a non-negotiating, “get-acquainted” session not tied to <gloss

                            xml:id="pg_196"/>sible, but not likely, that Brezhnev would handle
                        himself as gruffly as he did in Paris, but the gamble seems worth
                            taking.<note n="2" xml:id="d46fn2">In the left-hand margin next to this
                            paragraph, the President wrote: “I agree. If B. is incompetent to
                            negotiate, a mtg w <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> may
                            be advisable.” Brezhnev embarked on a 3-day state visit to France on

                        consider what measures could be taken before September to encourage the
                        Russians to consider more actively possible areas of movement on their part,
                        without ourselves appearing over-eager. One such measure might be to use the
                        exploratory channel of non-governmental scientists who have been involved in
                        the joint study group on arms control with the Soviet Academy of Sciences
                        for the past 14 years. They have an invitation from the Soviet Academy,
                        which could be used to arrange a meeting in August, primarily for the
                        purpose of eliciting responses from the Soviet side. The group could include
                        such men as <persName corresp="#p_DP_1">Paul Doty</persName>, <persName

                        interest to the Soviet leadership, and the possibility of some movement in

                        be of more than symbolic importance. (We could also use the occasion to
                        stress our interest in having Brezhnev receive Ambassador <persName

                        make the point in this way than to make it as a pre-condition.) <persName

                        security objections to having the computer on Soviet territory, and would
                        yield results of considerable benefit to us.</p>

                        detailed examination than is possible in this memorandum, but it is worth
                        consideration as an expression of our long-term interest in drawing the
                        Soviet Union into more responsible and constructive participation in

                        as a mark of our intentions, and may have substantial effects over time.
                        Once we have completed our preparations, we could consider sending someone

                        received by the Soviet Union, and could have substantial benefits, providing

                            noted: “The President apparently asked some time ago, in a marginal
                            note, for a memo from you on our four year policy goals. The White House
                            asked for it again last week. Neither the White House Staff nor S/S have
                            a record or copy of his request; we are not, therefore, sure of exactly
                            what he wanted.” <persName corresp="#p_LWAK_1">Lake</persName> then

                    </list>
                    <p>Our overriding goals are to make the world safer and more humane. There are
                        thus three general concerns which animate our foreign policy:</p>
                    <p>—Pursuit of peace.</p>
                    <p>—Promotion of equitable economic development and well-being.</p>
                    <p>—Protection of individual rights.</p>
                    <p>These are long-term goals. What is most notable about your approach to
                        foreign policy is precisely your emphasis on undertaking now so many major
                        efforts aimed at the quality of life in succeeding generations.</p>
                    <p>This means a very ambitious and far-reaching agenda. Many of the beginning
                        steps now being taken will not bear tangible fruit for some time to come.
                        But unless we start now, there will be no prospect of success.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">PURSUIT OF PEACE</p>
                    <p>The pursuit of peace operates at several levels. Above all it involves the
                        evolution of relationships with the <hi rend="italic">Soviet Union</hi>. The
                        opening <pb n="200" facs="0241" xml:id="pg_200"/>months of the
                        Administration have produced several areas of friction; to some extent this
                        reflects Soviet difficulty in adjusting to the new style and emphasis of
                        your Administration. There are also genuine areas of new
                        contention—particularly on the theme of human rights. But the basic
                        interests of both the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in avoiding crisis and tension remain
                        unaltered.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Arms Control</hi>. <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        is the centerpiece of the process. We have found a framework for agreement
                        and now must establish enough confidence between the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        <hi rend="italic">to achieve agreements that reduce, not merely limit, our
                            strategic arsenals</hi>. Achieving such agreements is a major goal, as
                        is a <hi rend="italic">comprehensive test ban</hi>. We will also work on
                        other detente and disarmament related issues, including <hi rend="italic">an
                                <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> agreement, increasing
                            East-West trade</hi> and all the issues involved in the <hi
                            rend="italic">Helsinki Final Act</hi>.</p>
                    <p>We would also hope, over the next four years, to reach better implicit
                        understandings with Moscow of “rules of the game” governing Soviet and
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> activities in third areas. Explicit
                        agreement might be found on the <hi rend="italic">Indian Ocean</hi>.</p>
                    <p>A halt to the pace of <hi rend="italic">nuclear proliferation</hi> and
                        agreements on the reduction in <hi rend="italic">conventional arms
                            transfers</hi> by the major developed country suppliers are key
                        complementary processes, as well as ends in themselves. We can legitimately
                        hope to freeze the number of nuclear weapons-capable states at six, at least
                        for the coming four years. Energy issues complicate our negotiations with
                        our <gloss target="#t_OECD_1">OECD</gloss> colleagues on nuclear
                        non-proliferation, and long-term progress will be slow and uncertain. We can
                        hope to stabilize and possibly reduce the total volume of arms sales through
                        strong negotiating efforts. Since Saudi Arabia, Iran and Israel are the big
                        three of the arms sales, peace in the Middle East will be the key to any
                        longer-term substantial reductions.</p>
                    <p>In addition to curtailing the weaponry of war and <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss>-Soviet conflict, we must work to contain regional, local, or
                        civil wars which threaten to involve the great powers, or which could
                        seriously weaken our friends. This means meeting security commitments and
                        maintaining military strength, as well as exploring initiatives in various
                        trouble spots as they arise. Hence a policy keyed to the following central
                        points:</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Middle East</hi>. Your talks with Arab and Israeli leaders
                        have cleared the air for constructive discussion. Even recognizing the
                        sudden complications of a new Israeli government, we have to build on that
                        basis to explore mutually advantageous solutions, and launch negotiations
                        for a <hi rend="italic">lasting Middle East settlement</hi>. It is hard to
                        be sanguine about a lasting settlement, but we must try to achieve one
                        within the next year or so. At minimum, we must continue to try to avert
                        another war.</p>

                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Africa</hi>. We have begun and should continue to achieve
                        a peaceful resolution to problems in southern Africa. A peaceful <hi

                        are all high on our agenda. As a matter both of principle and practical
                        politics, it is important to us that uncontrolled racial violence not
                        develop in any of these areas. In the Horn of Africa there is serious
                        potential instability and our policies will continue to aim at preventing
                        warfare and limiting an expansion of Soviet influence.</p>

                    <p>The world is unusually free of armed conflict at the present time. We will
                        watch carefully the potential development of crises or conflicts in all
                        areas with the objective of working toward their peaceful resolution. The

                    <p>Stress on process, rather than on single events, is central to promoting our
                        relations with more estranged nations. Aside from our ongoing pursuit of
                        detente with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, we hope to <hi

                        and through multilateral organizations such as the United Nations, the
                        Organization of American States, the Conference on Security and Cooperation
                        in Europe, and international financial institutions.</p>
                    <p>Underpinning all these specific objectives is the need for <hi rend="italic"
                            >enhanced public confidence in our foreign policy</hi>. Without this
                        support, we will be unable to achieve these goals.</p>
                    <p>The collective effect of attending to peace, economic development, and
                        individual rights is a new design for American diplomacy, drawn from the
                        values and standards of the American people. It is a far reaching outline
                        for action—clear in some areas, needing more definition in others.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">There is overlap and interaction among our goals</hi>.
                        Pursuit of peace through <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Soviet agreement
                        on strategic arms, for example, depends in part on American domestic
                        confidence that our policy reflects our traditional concern for human
                        rights. Our goals regarding conventional arms sales, human rights, nuclear
                        proliferation, and energy may collide in very complex ways when applied, for
                        example, in the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Diplomacy also deserves public dialogue</hi>. A shift from
                        secrecy to raising issues for discussion with the Congress and the people
                        before making decisions is already evident. In time, it should strengthen
                        public support, buttress Congressional backing, give credence to calls for
                        allied consultation, and educate the American people on the trade-offs
                        between some short-term costs and longer-term objectives.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Finally, diplomacy succeeds most surely when it takes into
                            account domestic priorities</hi>. Conflicts and contradictions are
                        inevitable in the sorting out of goals—whether for foreign or domestic
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>To be effective, we must weigh such obvious trade-offs as increasing economic
                        aid for the <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s at the apparent expense
                        of our own citizens or decreasing arms transfers at the possible cost of
                        closing <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> factories and adding to our own
                        unemployed. There are also opportunities for positive reinforcement of our
                        domestic and diplomatic goals: through creative international initiatives on
                        such problems as our cities, youth unemployment, basic human needs, food,
                        and energy.</p>

                    <p>Because the interplay between domestic and diplomatic goals is so clear and
                        because it suggests at least as many opportunities as problems, I conclude
                        with a suggestion. You might wish to allot at least one Cabinet session each
                        quarter to an assessment and projection of where our diplomatic and domestic
                        goals interact and how we can best minimize the damage from frictions and
                        capitalize on the connection.</p>

                    <p>On June 29, 1977, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cyrus
                            Vance</persName> addressed a meeting of the Asia Society in New York.
                        Founded by <persName corresp="#p_RJD_1">John D. Rockefeller</persName> III
                        during the 1950s, the Asia Society helped to improve American understanding
                        of Asian cultures. <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> begin his
                        remarks, entitled “America’s Role in Consolidating a Peaceful Balance and
                        Promoting Economic Growth in Asia,” by noting that American prospects for
                        “sustaining and developing relationships” with East Asian nations were more
                        promising than at any time since World War II. The <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> administration sought to
                        capitalize upon positive developments in U.S.-Asian relationships, while
                        preventing negative trends that might upset the “presently favorable
                        regional environment.” U.S. interests in Asia, he asserted, “are enduring,
                        and they are substantial.” He continued:</p>
                    <p>“I hope to leave you with these understandings:</p>
                    <p>“—First, the United States is and will remain an Asian and Pacific power.</p>
                    <p>“—Second, the United States will continue its key role in contributing to
                        peace and stability in Asia and the Pacific.</p>
                    <p>“—Third, the United States seeks normal and friendly relations with the
                        countries in the area on the basis of reciprocity and mutual respect.</p>
                    <p>“—Fourth, the United States will pursue mutual expansion of trade and
                        investment across the Pacific, recognizing the growing interdependence of
                        the economies of the United States and the region.</p>
                    <p>“—Fifth, we will use our influence to improve the human conditions of the
                        peoples of Asia.</p>
                    <p>“In all of this, there can be no doubt of the enduring vitality of our
                        country’s relationships with the peoples of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
                    <pb n="207" facs="0248" xml:id="pg_207"/>
                    <p>“To the people of Asia I say tonight without qualification that our nation
                        has recovered its self-confidence at home. And we have not abandoned our
                        interest in Asia.</p>
                    <p>“We are and will remain a Pacific nation, by virtue of our geography, our
                        history, our commerce, and our interests. Roughly one-quarter of all our
                        trade is now with East Asia and the Pacific; last year we sold $22 billion
                        worth of our products in the region. For the last five years more of our
                        trade has been with that region than with any other, including the European
                        Community.</p>
                    <p>“To be able to speak of peace and stability in Asia is a welcome change. But
                        serious problems persist. Our tasks are to help consolidate the emerging
                        peaceful balance in Asia and to promote economic growth that offers promise
                        to its peoples.</p>
                    <p>“The United States will pursue its relations with the nations of Asia with an
                        open mind. We will continue to work closely with allies and friends. And we
                        hope to normalize relations on a mutually constructive basis with those who
                        have been adversaries.</p>
                    <p>“The United States recognizes the importance of its continuing contribution
                        to Asian security. We will maintain a strong military presence in the area.”

                        They are part of wider developments in Western Europe—and the relations of
                        these countries with us—that have been characterized as malaise or
                        stagnation.</p>
                    <p>Today’s problems have several causes. Among them are:</p>
                    <p>—The mismanagement of the U.S. economy during the Vietnam War (particularly
                        1967–71) helped hasten the end of the effective workings of an international
                        economic system that had prospered—with American strength and
                        leadership—since the War. Since then, the central pivot of stability and
                        confidence in the global economic system has been missing.</p>
                    <p>—The oil price rises of 1973–75 deepened gathering economic problems, pushing
                        inflation into double digits and unemployment to levels not seen in
                        post-Marshall Plan Europe. And these countries, after all, have much more
                        searing memories of the 1930’s economic failure than in the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>—In Europe—as here—there are few economic answers to what seem endemic
                        problems; in Europe, even more than here, there has been a loss of
                        confidence in the ability of institutions and leaders to solve the new
                        economic riddle of “stagflation.” Only Germany, among the major states, is
                        relatively untouched: but there the fear of economic collapse is deepest of
                        all.</p>
                    <p>—Political institutions also seem unable to cope with basic social problems.
                        With recession, there has been a widening gap between economic expectations
                        that had come to be taken for granted (particularly in welfare states), and
                        the ability of governments to deliver. These problems are particularly acute
                        among the young—which is one reason the issue of youth unemployment was put
                        in the agenda at the London <pb n="209" facs="0250" xml:id="pg_209"/>Summit.
                        As governments conspicuously have failed to come to grips with economic and
                        social problems—which are only partly of their making—loss of confidence has
                        spread widely. Ironically, one of the most talented groups of European
                        statesmen in recent memory presides over a collection of governments facing
                        constant challenge—from both left and right. Protest voting has become
                        almost the rule.</p>
                    <p>—In several European countries, the major political parties themselves are
                        overdue for renewal (especially in Italy and from the center to the right in
                        France); or they are so riven with factionalism—as in Britain—that even
                        talented leaders are unable to effect reforms that will broaden their
                        political base.</p>
                    <p>—At the same time, economic difficulty struck in the middle of a hopeful
                        development: the progressive modernization of most European
                        societies—searching for means of coping with post-industrial problems in
                        labor-management relations, social organization, and cultural
                        development.</p>
                    <p>—The European Community, meanwhile, lost the economic basis of its past
                        success, at about the point when it was seeking to build a broader European
                            <hi rend="italic">political</hi> society on its economic strength. Yet
                        instead of stepping back to re-establish the economic strength of the
                        Community and its member nations, they are concentrating upon enlarging the
                        Community and holding European elections. While both are worthy
                        objectives—which politically we must support—they are being used as a
                        substitute for the economic strength, cooperation, and purpose that the
                        Community’s founders and best minds have always known must be the basis of
                        an effective Community.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Communist Parties (and Internal Reform)</p>
                    <p>It is against this background that the growth of West European Communist
                        Parties is so unsettling. If West European economies were strong—and if
                        there were strong confidence in the economic and political role of the
                        United States on the Continent—there would be far less uneasiness about the
                        French and Italian Communist parties (and far more optimism about dealing
                        with them, based on democratic successes in Portugal and Spain). There would
                        be more confidence that left-wing movements—engaged in needed transformation
                        of societies—could in the process contain or simply pre-empt the influence
                        of the Communists.</p>
                    <p>As it is, there is too little optimism in Europe that moribund governments
                        can cope with the discipline of the Communist parties—acting with or without
                        support from Moscow. The French Socialists and the Italian Christian
                        Democrats each believe they can somehow derive strength from the more
                        energetic Communists, without succumbing to them. In normal times, the
                        intellectual left in these coun<pb n="210" facs="0251" xml:id="pg_210"
                        />tries would be fighting anti-democratic movements tooth and nail. Now it,
                        too, has lost its spirit and courage.</p>
                    <p>If Communists do gain or share power, the political impact will derive in
                        large part from what this change will say about the perceived poverty of
                        democratic alternatives. A victory by the Socialist-Communist coalition in
                        France next March would very likely hasten the entry of the Italian
                        Communists into the government in some form. It would almost surely drive
                        Germany to the right—thereby polarizing the European Community and <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> (in addition to the problems a Mitterand
                        Government would directly pose for those institutions). The United States
                        and Germany would be bound even more closely together, and would be
                        effectively isolated in the Atlantic relationship, along with a more
                        conservative but ineffectual Britain. A further fear is that the United
                        States would in some way withdraw from the Continent—a fear that is actually
                        greater than the fear that the Soviet Union would gain direct advantages
                        from Communists in a West European government.</p>
                    <p>The prospect of Communists in government also raises longer-range questions:
                        which groups will manage social, economic, and political change in the major
                        West European countries? Will they have enough political strength to manage
                        these changes effectively? And who will provide the sense of direction and
                        purpose for the European Community—assuming that it continues at all as more
                        than a loose customs union?</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Relations with the United States</p>
                    <p>At the heart of the Atlantic relationship, our European friends and allies
                        look to us most for two kinds of “security”: military and economic.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Military security</hi> is more than just the
                        continuation of our commitment to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, to
                        its doctrines, and to deterrence of the Soviet Union. Here your London
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> visit—with your emphasis on
                        reassurance and the steadfastness of American purpose—had a positive impact;
                        and except for Germany, our allies place a <hi rend="italic">lower</hi>
                        estimate on the chances of a European war than we do.</p>
                    <p>Even more important as a <hi rend="italic">political factor</hi> in Atlantic
                        relations, our allies need to have confidence in our ability to manage
                        relations with the Soviet Union. Almost without exception, they have been
                        noticeably uneasy during the past few months—in part reflecting disquiet at
                        the beginning of <hi rend="italic">every</hi> new Administration.</p>
                    <p>But, there is also deep concern over the course of the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> negotiations—as much for what “failure”
                        would imply politically in East-West relations as for what it could mean in
                        strategic terms. And widespread European concern earlier this year about our
                        resolve in Africa <pb n="211" facs="0252" xml:id="pg_211"/>was heightened by
                        worries that we are not able to manage the overall U.S.-Soviet
                        relationship.</p>
                    <p>Less important, but more visible, is widespread European uneasiness about
                        your human rights policies (especially in Germany and France). This
                        uneasiness is only in part based on different tactics or different concerns
                        (as with the ethnic Germans in the East). It is more a fear that basic
                        relations with Moscow will be damaged. Brezhnev has been quick to exploit
                        these fears: in his visit to Paris, in his courting of the Germans, and in
                        the effort to split us off from our allies at the Belgrade conference by
                        presenting a “non-confrontational” alternative to Soviet-American bickering
                        on human rights. In fact, however, your human rights position will in time
                        be seen as a basic underpinning of European society—i.e., as supporting
                        democratic structures and practices. It is already proving to be a weapon
                        against the West European Communist parties.</p>
                    <p>For our allies, the alternatives to our effective managing of relations with
                        Moscow are not pleasant: a return to earlier tensions; pressures to build up
                        defenses (which their economies and their populations would not tolerate);
                        damage to independent initiatives with the East (particularly by Germany and
                        France); disruption of trading relations with the East; and perhaps even
                        being left holding the sizeable debts of the Soviet Union and East European
                        states.</p>
                    <p>Difficulties in U.S.-Soviet relations also remind our allies that they have
                        very little influence over the course of these relations—on which so much
                        depends for them. Thus our Indian Ocean policy illustrated for Britain and
                        France that security decisions are being taken about an area in which they
                        have interests and involvements, but without their playing a real role. If
                        it can happen there, what about in Europe?</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Economic security</hi> for our allies in Europe depends
                        in large part on their confidence that we can cope effectively with our <hi
                            rend="italic">own</hi> problems, that we will not export our problems to
                        Europe (e.g., through protectionism), and that we will <hi rend="italic">in
                            fact</hi> see our economic future as bound up with Europe’s. The London
                        Summit was an excellent beginning—but only that. The Europeans are waiting
                        to see:</p>
                    <p>—Can we continue our economic recovery—without excessive increases in exports
                        to Europe or succumbing to protectionist efforts to decrease their exports
                        to us?</p>
                    <p>—Will we adopt a <hi rend="italic">truly effective</hi> energy program to
                        reduce dependence? (This deep concern is partly psychological: constant
                        European pressing on this point goes far beyond the merits or value of an
                        effective energy program, to the heart of our determination—or lack of it—to
                        take the energy problem seriously.)</p>
                    <p>—Will we help finance weak European economies to avoid their having to impose
                        import restrictions or undertake drastically restrictive measures?</p>
                    <pb n="212" facs="0253" xml:id="pg_212"/>
                    <p>—Are we truly committed to revitalizing international institutions, like the

                    <p>—Will we approach the multilateral trade negotiations in ways which avoid
                        threatening fundamental <gloss target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> institutions like
                        the Common Agricultural Policy?<note n="3" xml:id="d49fn3">The 1957 Treaty
                            of Rome, signed by Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany,
                            Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, defined general objectives for a
                            Common Agricultural Policy, which included the initiation of subsidy
                            payments and price supports designed to stabilize European agriculture.
                            The European Commission proposed the <gloss target="#t_CAP_1"

                    </p>
                    <p>—Are we <hi rend="italic">capable</hi> of preventing another Middle East war,
                        that would cripple the European economy in another oil embargo?</p>
                    <p>—Can we understand—and account for—their long-range fears of being swamped by

                        seen by many Europeans (especially in France) as interrelated. These issues
                        raise real questions about the capacity of European economies to compete
                        with the United States in an age increasingly dominated (in exportable
                        goods) by high technology.</p>
                    <p>—Conversely, can we work with Western Europe (and Japan) so that the <hi

                        to another period of intense economic competition (like that of 1970–73), in
                        which the United States again defaults on its pledges to respect and support
                        a strong European Community?</p>
                    <p>—Can we work out differences on North-South issues with them and the <gloss

                        to the more vulnerable European economies?</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Leadership</p>
                    <p>Your Administration holds out great promise for Europe—and what it can derive
                        from renewed American strength of will and purpose. You have effectively put
                        Vietnam and Watergate behind us, and have offered the promise of new vigor
                        in a host of areas. The “European first” strategy is attractive—but there is
                        still a lot of cynicism about what you will do in practice. Even after the
                        Summit, many Europeans are still from “Missouri.”</p>
                    <p>The issue is complicated by what has long been European ambivalence about
                        American leadership: when it is not there (as during the Vietnam/Watergate
                        years), there is deep concern about our will and purpose; but when we
                        exercise leadership, there is contrary concern about <hi rend="italic"
                            >specific actions and U.S. dominance</hi>. Thus many Europeans could
                        welcome the vigor of your early decisions, and yet object to policies like
                            <pb n="213" facs="0254" xml:id="pg_213"/>the one on non-proliferation
                        that seem to strike at their economic interests. This contrary European
                        reaction has happened in past Administrations—and it will happen again.</p>
                    <p>Unlike times in the past, however, the <hi rend="italic">relative</hi>
                        economic and political weight of the United States is not enough on its own
                        to carry the day—<hi rend="italic">against</hi> the ambivalence of
                        Europeans, but perhaps <hi rend="italic">to</hi> their ultimate
                        self-interest.</p>
                    <p>Now, more than before, U.S. leadership must involve prodding, cajoling,
                        consulting—and a lot of stroking. At times it will be valuable to accept
                        European views of policy that are different from ours—simply as part of the
                        relationship (as we did in not objecting to the most recent <gloss
                            target="#t_EC_1">EC</gloss> statement on the Middle East). You are the
                        only Western leader with a firm mandate for the next four years—and you pay
                        the penalty that weak European leaders will lean upon you, while at the same
                        time trying to have their own way. There will be a further failure of
                        European will if we seem not to respond to European needs, but little thanks
                        if we do.</p>
                    <p>Above all else, you (and the government behind you) must convince the
                        Europeans that you know what you are doing, that you have a sense of where
                        you are going—and can articulate it—and have the strength to carry it
                        through, beginning at home. You must convince them that you have <hi
                            rend="italic">some</hi> economic answers—even though they clearly do
                        not; and you must convince them that you can manage all those other
                        relations (with the Soviet Union, and in the Middle East) on which for them
                        so much depends.</p>
                    <p>But even with economic recovery—and with a clear demonstration of your
                        competence, purpose, and openness—the Europeans must do the rest for
                        themselves (and you can encourage greater European leadership). But their
                        doing this is complicated by the fact that the particular leaders you are
                        dealing with this year have their own agendas of simply staying in power. We
                        must find a way to reach beyond their short-term needs, to build relations
                        with <hi rend="italic">countries</hi> that will outlast this group of
                        leaders.</p>

                        very much to the United States. This is a fact more and more Americans are
                        coming to understand.</p>
                    <p>You in the <gloss target="#t_NAACP_1">NAACP</gloss> have recognized this fact
                        since the first days of your organization, almost 70 years ago—in sponsoring
                        the first Pan African Congress in 1919;<note n="2" xml:id="d50fn2">Convening
                            in Paris February 19–21, 1919, the first Pan African Congress brought
                            together African leaders to address the status of Africa during the
                            postwar period, specifically the former German colonies. Attendees
                            endorsed the right of Africans to participate in their own governments
                            and charged the League of Nations with upholding this right.</note> in
                        your calls, during the days of the Marshall plan, for effective assistance,
                        as well, to Africa, the Caribbean, and other developing areas.</p>
                    <p>We in a new Administration hope that we can show similar vision as we build
                        our policies toward Africa.</p>
                    <p>We proceed from a basic proposition: that our policies must recognize the
                        unique identity of Africa. We can be neither right, nor effective, if we
                        treat Africa simply as one part of the Third World, or as a testing ground
                        of East-West competition.</p>
                    <pb n="215" facs="0256" xml:id="pg_215"/>
                    <p>African reality is incredibly diverse. But out of this diversity comes a
                        general fact of great importance: Africa has an enormous potential—in human
                        talent, in resources to be developed, in energy to be harnessed.</p>
                    <p>Let us consider how this is true in terms of our own national interests; for
                        Africa’s potential is tied to our own.</p>
                    <p>—The success or failure of the search for racial justice and peace in
                        southern Africa will have profound effects among the American people. And
                        our participation in that search is based on the values of our own
                        society.</p>
                    <p>—The role of the African nations at the United Nations, and in other
                        multilateral bodies, is pivotal. One-third of the U.N. member states are
                        African.</p>
                    <p>—Africa’s mineral and agricultural wealth already provides a substantial
                        portion of our imports of such commodities as copper, cobalt, and manganese
                        for our industries, and cocoa and coffee for our homes. And Africa supplies
                        38 percent of our crude petroleum imports.</p>
                    <p>—Our direct investment in sub-Saharan Africa has increased nearly sixfold
                        over the past 15 years; our trade now is almost 12 times what it was then.
                        And the pattern of our trade with Africa includes an even larger share for
                        black Africa. Trade with South Africa in 1960 was 39 percent of our commerce
                        with Africa; now, our trade with Nigeria alone is double the value of that
                        with South Africa.</p>
                    <p>—Beyond these political and economic ties that bind our futures, there are
                        the social and cultural links from which we have benefited greatly. Our
                        society and culture are enriched by the heritage so many Americans find in
                        Africa. We experience this enrichment every day—in our literature, our art,
                        our music, and our social values.</p>
                    <p>During the past few months, as we have considered the specific policies I
                        will discuss today, a number of broad points have emerged. They define the
                        general nature of our approach.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">First, the most effective policies toward Africa are
                            affirmative policies.</hi> They should not be reactive to what other
                        powers do, nor to crises as they arise. Daily headlines should not set our
                        agenda for progress. A negative, reactive American policy that seeks only to
                        oppose Soviet or Cuban involvement in Africa would be both dangerous and
                        futile. Our best course is to help resolve the problems which create
                        opportunities for external intervention.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Second, our objective must be to foster a prosperous and
                            strong Africa that is at peace with itself and at peace with the
                            world.</hi> The long-term success of our African policy will depend more
                        on our actual assistance to African development and our ability to help
                        Africans resolve their disputes than on maneuvers for short-term diplomatic
                        advantage.</p>
                    <pb n="216" facs="0257" xml:id="pg_216"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Third, our policies should recognize and encourage African
                            nationalism.</hi> Having won independence, African nations will defend
                        it against challenges from any source. If we try to impose American
                        solutions for African problems, we may sow division among the Africans and
                        undermine their ability to oppose efforts at domination by others. We will
                        not do so.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Fourth, our policies must reflect our national
                            values.</hi> Our deep belief in human rights—political, economic, and
                        social—leads us to policies that support their promotion throughout Africa.
                        This means concern for individuals whose rights are threatened anywhere on
                        the continent. And it means making our best effort peacefully to promote
                        racial justice in southern Africa. In this we join the many African nations
                        who, having won their freedom, are determined that all of Africa shall be
                        free.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Fifth, our ties with Africa are not only political, but
                            cultural and economic as well.</hi> It is the latter two that are most
                        enduring.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">And finally, we will seek openness in our dealings with
                            African states.</hi> We are willing to discuss any issue, African or
                        global; to broaden our dialogue with African nations; and to try to work
                        with them, even when we may not agree.</p>
                    <p>Only thus can we promote our views without rancor. Our renewed relations with
                        the People’s Republic of the Congo, our experience at the recent conference
                        on southern Africa in Maputo [U.N.-sponsored International Conference in
                        Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia, May 16–21], and our work
                        with African delegations at the United Nations all demonstrate the value of
                        this approach.</p>
                    <p>In the end, of course, our Africa policy will be judged by results, not
                        intentions.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Assistance for Human Needs</p>
                    <p>One of Africa’s principal concerns is that its basic human needs be met.
                        Despite its vast resources, it is still one of the least developed areas of
                        the world. Eighteen of the twenty-eight least developed countries in the
                        world are African.</p>
                    <p>We are prepared to help.</p>
                    <p>In addition to our growing trade and investment relationships with African
                        nations, we are committed to providing economic assistance that will
                        directly improve the lives of those most in need. Turning this principle
                        into practice cannot be accomplished overnight. But it must be done.</p>
                    <p>Our economic assistance to Africa is being increased from $271 million in
                        fiscal year 1976 to a projected $450 million in fiscal year 1978. We hope
                        that assistance from our European friends will also increase, and expect to
                        consult with them on how we all can make the most effective
                        contributions.</p>
                    <pb n="217" facs="0258" xml:id="pg_217"/>
                    <p>To help our aid reach rural villages, we will emphasize support for the
                        development and sharing of appropriate technology and techniques. I have in
                        mind such devices as small farm machinery now being manufactured in Senegal,
                        Upper Volta, Mali, and elsewhere; hand-hydraulic palm oil presses in
                        Nigeria; and basic agricultural extension methods that have succeeded in one
                        nation and could be applied in another. We will also expand support for
                        agricultural research in Africa and try to assure that our own technical
                        assistance is appropriate to African requirements.</p>
                    <p>We also acknowledge the needs of African states for advanced techniques that
                        will enable them to develop and process more of their own natural
                        resources.</p>
                    <p>Our Agency for International Development, headed by Governor <persName
                            corresp="#p_GJJ_1">[John J.] Gilligan</persName>, is determined to cut
                        down on red tape in approving assistance projects, so it can respond quickly
                        and effectively. Greater attention will be given to projects which can be
                        started quickly and require minimal outside technical assistance or
                        expensive equipment.</p>
                    <p>Men and women are more important than machines. Africa’s natural resources
                        will be developed by Africa’s people. Human development is thus the key to
                        Africa’s future. While we will provide additional opportunities for Africans
                        to study here, emphasis will be on programs of training and education in
                        Africa.</p>
                    <p>We must also remember the importance of Africa’s infrastructure. It is a vast
                        continent, and improved transport and communications are essential to its
                        welfare.</p>
                    <p>I am aware, as I indicate these directions for our programs, how tempting,
                        but mistaken, it would be to design blueprints for another continent’s
                        development. We can only work effectively if we work cooperatively with
                        African governments in behalf of <hi rend="italic">their</hi> development
                        priorities. Accordingly, we will seek to increase our contribution to the
                        African Development Fund. And we are requesting from the Congress $200
                        million for the Sahel, to be managed in coordination with the Club du
                        Sahel.</p>
                    <p>The long drought in the Sahel devastated the economies of some of the poorest
                        countries in the world. Now these countries are working together to become
                        self-sufficient in food production and to develop the ability to withstand
                        future droughts.</p>
                    <p>In the Club du Sahel, the African states plan together for the region. The
                        donor nations participate in the planning and determine how each can assist
                        most effectively. They then commit the resources necessary to meet their
                        goals. In this process, we are discovering the great value of encouraging
                        coordination among African states; of planning with them and with other
                        donors; and of concentrating on regional <pb n="218" facs="0259"
                            xml:id="pg_218"/>problems rather than isolated projects. For it will be
                        essential that sensible and effective programs be planned and
                        implemented.</p>
                    <p>America can fully support African development only if we meet the kind of
                        commitments I have outlined. I hope that every citizen with an interest in
                        Africa will make it clear, to the Congress and to us in the executive
                        branch, that he or she wants those commitments met.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Promotion of Human Rights</p>
                    <p>While we address the reality of human need in Africa, we must also do what we
                        can in behalf of human justice there.</p>
                    <p>We will be firm in our support of individual human rights. Our concern is not
                        limited to any one region of the continent.</p>
                    <p>We must understand the diversity of African social and value systems. Gross
                        violations of individual human dignity are no more acceptable in African
                        terms than in ours. One of the most significant events in modern African
                        history—and in the international effort to promote human rights—was the
                        recent decision by Commonwealth countries to condemn the “massive violation
                        of human rights” in Uganda.<note n="3" xml:id="d50fn3">Reference is to a
                            communiqué released during the British Commonwealth heads of government
                            meeting in London June 8–16 condemning Ugandan human rights abuses and
                            reaffirming support for majority black rule in Rhodesia. See R.W. Apple

                            1977, p. A–11.</note> Many African nations took part in this decision.
                        Their action should be applauded.</p>
                    <p>Abuse of human rights is wrong on any grounds. It is particularly offensive
                        when it is on the basis of race. In southern Africa, issues of race, of
                        justice, and of self-determination have built to a crisis.</p>
                    <p>—The conflict in Rhodesia is growing. Rhodesian incursions into neighboring
                        countries exacerbate an already dangerous situation and deserve the
                        condemnation they have received. The choice between negotiated settlement
                        and violent solution must be made now. The same is true for Namibia. Many
                        lives—black and white—hang in the balance.</p>
                    <p>—The risk of increased foreign involvement is real.</p>
                    <p>—Violence within South Africa grows. There may be more time there than in
                        Rhodesia and Namibia for people of goodwill to achieve a solution. But
                        progress must soon be made, or goodwill could be lost.</p>
                    <p>—Crisis within the region has brought pressure for stronger action at the
                        United Nations, and appeals to our responsibilities under its charter.</p>
                    <p>This is the reality we face. The dangers, our interests, and our values, as
                        well as the desires of the Africans themselves, require our involvement—and
                        our most dedicated and practical efforts.</p>
                    <pb n="219" facs="0260" xml:id="pg_219"/>
                    <p>We cannot impose solutions in southern Africa. We cannot dictate terms to any
                        of the parties; our leverage is limited.</p>
                    <p>But we are among the few governments in the world that can talk to both white
                        and black Africans frankly and yet with a measure of trust. We would lose
                        our ability to be helpful if we lost that trust. It is therefore essential
                        that our policies of encouraging justice for people of all races in southern
                        Africa be clear to all.</p>
                    <p>After careful consideration, this Administration has decided to pursue
                        actively solutions to all three southern African problems—Rhodesia, Namibia,
                        and the situation within South Africa itself. These problems must be
                        addressed together, for they are intertwined.</p>
                    <p>Some have argued that apartheid in South Africa should be ignored for the
                        time being, in order to concentrate on achieving progress on Rhodesia and
                        Namibia. Such a policy would be wrong and would not work.</p>
                    <p>—It would be blind to the reality that the beginning of progress must be made
                        soon within South Africa, if there is to be a possibility of peaceful
                        solutions in the longer run;</p>
                    <p>—It could mislead the South Africans about our real concerns;</p>
                    <p>—It would prejudice our relations with our African friends;</p>
                    <p>—It would do a disservice to our own beliefs; and</p>
                    <p>—It would discourage those of all races who are working for peaceful progress
                        within South Africa.</p>
                    <p>We believe that we can effectively influence South Africa on Rhodesia and
                        Namibia while expressing our concerns about apartheid. Implicit in that
                        belief is the judgment that progress in all three areas is strongly in the
                        interest of the South African Government.</p>
                    <p>We believe that whites as well as blacks must have a future in Namibia,
                        Zimbabwe, and South Africa. We also believe that their security lies in
                        progress. Intransigence will only lead to greater insecurity.</p>
                    <p>We will welcome and recognize positive action by South Africa on <hi
                            rend="italic">each</hi> of these three issues. But the need is real for
                        progress on <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of them.</p>
                    <p>Let me review briefly our approach to each.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Rhodesia</p>
                    <p>We are actively supporting a British initiative to achieve a negotiated
                        settlement of the Rhodesian crisis. In coming weeks, we will be seeking
                        agreement on a constitution that would allow free elections, open to all
                        parties and in which all of voting age could participate equally. These
                        elections would establish the government of an independent Zimbabwe. Our
                        goal is that this be accomplished during 1978.</p>
                    <p>This constitution should include a justiciable bill of rights and an
                        independent judiciary, so that the rights of all citizens, of all races, are
                        protected.</p>
                    <pb n="220" facs="0261" xml:id="pg_220"/>
                    <p>We also hope to lend greater assistance to the peoples of neighboring nations
                        whose lives have been disrupted by the crisis in southern Africa.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Namibia</p>
                    <p>In Namibia a solution leading to independence is being sought through the
                        efforts of the five Western members of the Security Council, with South
                        Africa, the United Nations, and other interested parties, including the
                        South West Africa People’s Organization. That solution would include free
                        elections in which the United Nations is involved, freedom for political
                        prisoners, repeal of discriminatory laws and regulations, and the withdrawal
                        of instruments of South African authority as the elections are held and
                        independence achieved.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of our discussions thus far, we are encouraged by the prospects
                        for an independent Namibia, one which will take its rightful place in the
                        African and world community. We welcome the indications of flexibility on
                        the part of South Africa. We are gratified by the confidence shown by many
                        African governments in the efforts of the United States and Western
                        associates on the Security Council. Differences remain, however, and
                        progress will require a willingness on all sides to be openminded and
                        forthcoming. But we will persevere.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">South Africa</p>
                    <p>While pursuing these efforts for peace and justice in Namibia and Rhodesia,
                        we have also expressed to the South African Government our firm belief in
                        the benefits of a progressive transformation of South African society. This
                        would mean an end to racial discrimination and the establishment of a new
                        course toward full political participation by all South Africans.</p>
                    <p>The specific form of government through which this participation could be
                        expressed is a matter for the people of South Africa to decide. There are
                        many ways in which the individual rights of all citizens within South Africa
                        could be protected. The key to the future is that South African citizens of
                        all races now begin a dialogue on how to achieve this better future.</p>
                    <p>The South African Government’s policy of establishing separate homelands for
                        black South Africans was devised without reference to the wishes of the
                        blacks themselves. For this reason, and because we do not believe it
                        constitutes a fair or viable solution to South Africa’s problems, we oppose
                        this policy. We did not recognize the Transkei, and we will not recognize
                        Bophuthatswana if its independence is proclaimed in December, as
                        scheduled.</p>
                    <p>We deeply hope that the South African Government will play a progressive role
                        on the three issues I have discussed. We will applaud such efforts. If there
                        is no progress, our relations will inevitably suffer.</p>
                    <pb n="221" facs="0262" xml:id="pg_221"/>
                    <p>We cannot defend a government that is based on a system of racial domination
                        and remain true to ourselves. For our policy toward South Africa is
                        reinforced by change in our own society. The activities of the <gloss
                            target="#t_NAACP_1">NAACP</gloss> are a testament to the inseparability
                        of our foreign and domestic goals. It is also entirely fitting that
                            <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Andy Young</persName> [U.S. Ambassador to
                        the United Nations], who has done so much in the struggle against our
                        divisions at home, should now be contributing so well to the design and
                        effectiveness of our policies abroad.</p>
                    <p>I have heard some suggest that we must support the white governments in
                        southern Africa, come what may, since they are anti-Communist. In fact, the
                        continued denial of racial justice in southern Africa encourages the
                        possibilities for outside intervention.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, when such crises as the recent invasion of Zaire arise,<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d50fn4">Reference is to the March 1977 invasion from Angola of
                            the southern Zaire province of Shaba, formerly known as Katanga.</note>
                        we see no advantage in unilateral responses and emphasizing their East-West
                        implications. We prefer to work with African nations, and with our European
                        allies, in positive efforts to resolve such disputes. As President <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> recently said, it is best to fight
                        fire with water.<note n="5" xml:id="d50fn5">During his May 22 Notre Dame
                            address (see <ref target="#d40">Document 40</ref>), the President
                            commented: “For too many years, we’ve been willing to adopt the flawed
                            and erroneous principles and tactics of our adversaries, sometimes
                            abandoning our own values for theirs. We’ve fought fire with fire, never
                            thinking that fire is better quenched with water.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The history of the past 15 years suggests that efforts by outside powers to
                        dominate African nations will fail. Our challenge is to find ways of being
                        supportive without becoming interventionist or intrusive.</p>
                    <p>We see no benefit if we interject ourselves into regional disputes. We hope
                        that they can be resolved through the diplomatic efforts of the parties
                        themselves in an African setting.</p>
                    <p>We are aware of the African concern that we have sometimes seemed more
                        interested in the activities of other outside powers in Africa than in
                        Africa itself. They know that some argue we should almost automatically
                        respond in kind to the increase in Soviet arms and Cuban personnel in
                        Africa.</p>
                    <p>We cannot ignore this increase—and we oppose it. All sides should be aware
                        that when outside powers pour substantial quantities of arms and military
                        personnel into Africa, it greatly enhances the danger that disputes will be
                        resolved militarily rather than through mediation by African states or by
                        the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss> [Organization of African

                    <p>This danger is particularly great in the Horn, where there has been an
                        escalation of arms transfers from the outside. The current difficulties in
                        Ethiopia, and the tensions among nations in the area, present complex
                        diplomatic challenges. We seek friendship with all the governments of that
                        region. We have established an embassy in the new nation of Djibouti. Its
                        peaceful accession to independence marks a step toward stability in what
                        remains a troubled area.</p>
                    <p>We will consider sympathetically appeals for assistance from states which are
                        threatened by a buildup of foreign military equipment and advisers on their
                        borders, in the Horn and elsewhere in Africa. But we hope such local arms
                        races and the consequent dangers of deepening outside involvement can be
                        limited.</p>
                    <p>In accordance with the policy recently announced by the President, arms
                        transfers to Africa will be an exceptional tool of our policy and will be
                        used only after the most careful consideration.<note n="6" xml:id="d50fn6"
                            >See <ref target="#d40fn5">footnote 5, Document 40</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>We hope that all the major powers will join us in supporting African
                        nationalism, rather than fragmenting it, and in concentrating on economic
                        assistance rather than arms.</p>
                    <p>Our approach is to build positive relations with the Africans primarily
                        through support for their political independence and economic development
                        and through the strengthening of our economic, cultural, and social ties.
                        Our new and positive relationships with nations like Nigeria encourage us in
                        this course. Our efforts to build such relations may not seize the
                        headlines. But this quiet strategy will produce long-term benefits.</p>
                    <p>Our relations will be closest with those nations whose views and actions are
                        most congruent with ours. We will never forget or take old friends for
                        granted. Their continuing friendship is a fundamental concern; they can rely
                        on our support. When the territorial integrity of a friendly state is
                        threatened, we will continue to respond to requests for appropriate
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>We do not insist that there is only one road to economic progress or one way
                        of expressing the political will of a people. In so diverse a continent, we
                        must be prepared to work with peoples and governments of distinctive and
                        differing beliefs.</p>

                        a change of Administrations. The Soviets traditionally have sought to drive
                        a wedge between the United States and the Europeans at each change of
                        Administration by suggesting either that we will not defend their interests
                        or that we are incompetent to do so.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets are making the same effort again. Their opportunities are
                        enhanced by the political and personal insecurities of several West European
                        leaders. That this is, in fact, a campaign is clear by the fact that they
                        are using the human rights issue on which <persName corresp="#p_SH_1"
                            >Schmidt</persName>, in particular, is vulnerable because of his desire

                    <p>The human rights issue is being portrayed by the Soviets as a campaign which

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Middle East</p>

                        in which we have sought to stimulate movement. The delicacy of the issues,
                        and the fact that the Arabs and the Israelis interpret the same things
                        differently, has made the need for a steady U.S. course all the more
                        important if our policy is to remain clear. For example, it is unfortunate
                        that we are now receiving reports that your efforts to explain our position
                        to American Jewish leaders yesterday is being interpreted by some of them as

                        economic center of gravity in Germany. The <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"

                        a key role in the international monetary system. German economic wealth
                        causes no less concern in both Eastern and Western Europe than Germany
                        military power. Thus, the possibility of German political pre-eminence in
                        Europe is again a shadow haunting Europe.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">The <gloss target="#t_FRG_1">FRG</gloss> domestic
                            political crisis</hi> has several sources. First, economic prosperity,
                        the German salve for defeat in the last war, has recently been threatened by
                        the specter of inflation and unemployment, seriously undermining the public
                        confidence. Even a change of political leadership will not likely change the
                        popular mood. Second, the <gloss target="#t_SPD_1">SPD</gloss>
                        <hi rend="italic">Ostpolitik</hi> has not produced the kinds of results that
                        were promised, either in inter-German relations or in relations with Moscow.
                        That makes the <gloss target="#t_SPD_1">SPD</gloss> vulnerable to attack by
                        the German right, especially the southern German <gloss target="#t_CSU_1"
                            >CSU</gloss> which is Catholic and anti-Communist. Moreover, the <gloss
                            target="#t_SPD_1">SPD</gloss> is ex-Marxist and has a northern
                        Protestant following, making the <gloss target="#t_SPD_1">SPD</gloss>’s
                        cultural ties to the East German populace suspect as being more natural than
                        ties to Bavaria. Third, some FDP members of the <gloss target="#t_SPD_1"
                            >SPD</gloss> coalition are already openly dealing with the opposition
                            <gloss target="#t_CDU_1">CDU</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CSU_1"
                            >CSU</gloss>. The weakness of the <gloss target="#t_SPD_1">SPD</gloss>’s
                        political base is now also reflected in the loss of control of the
                        Bundesrat. Thus, <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Helmut Schmidt</persName> is in
                        serious political trouble, but the <gloss target="#t_CDU_1"

                        Moreover, German paranoia is encouraged by what may look like a tacit

                    <p>The three interacting developments—(1) German military and economic power
                        combined with political weakness, (2) the crisis of <hi rend="italic"

                        Bonn uncomfortable with the West and frustrated by the East. This is a step
                        back toward the traditional German predicament of being in the middle. At
                        the same time, the interaction of external and domestic political factors
                        could damage the fragile roots of West German democracy. Economic
                        deprivation, fear of Communism, and growing disillusionment with the Western
                        democracies, including the U.S., could in the long run feed anti-democratic
                        and authoritarian sentiments in schizophrenic Germany. The Soviet Union, to
                        be sure, will attempt to exploit the emerging opportunity to loosen Bonn’s
                        ties with the U.S.”</p>

                    <p>[Omitted here are the President’s introductory remarks.]</p>
                    <p>And I want to talk to you today about the hopes and problems that we as
                        southerners and as Americans share together. I feel a special kinship with
                        your State legislators. For 4 years I was a member of the Georgia Senate,
                        and I still prize State government not only for the talents of those who
                        work in it but, as Fritz Hollings says, for the closeness to the people it
                        represents.</p>
                    <p>Our Southern States have a proud tradition of local, independent government,
                        and now you’re the heirs of that tradition. But we in the South have also
                        felt, perhaps more directly than many others, some of the rapid changes that
                        have taken place in this modern age. More and <pb n="229" facs="0270"
                            xml:id="pg_229"/>more our own lives are shaped by events in other
                        cities, decisions in other States, tensions in other parts of the world.</p>
                    <p>And as Americans we cannot overlook the way that our fate is bound to that of
                        other nations. This interdependence stretches from the health of our
                        economy, through war and peace, to the security of our own energy supplies.
                        It’s a new world in which we cannot afford to be narrow in our vision,
                        limited in our foresight, or selfish in our purpose.</p>
                    <p>When I took office almost exactly 6 months ago, our Nation was faced with a
                        series of problems around the world—in southern Africa, the Middle East, in
                        our relationships with our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies,
                        and on such tough questions as nuclear proliferation, negotiations with our
                        former adversaries, a Panama Canal treaty, human rights, world poverty.</p>
                    <p>We have openly and publicly addressed these and other many difficult and
                        controversial issues—some of which had been either skirted or postponed in
                        the past.</p>
                    <p>As I pointed out in a recent press conference, a period of debate,
                        disagreement, probing was inevitable.<note n="2" xml:id="d52fn2">Reference
                            is to the President’s July 12 news conference. For text, see ibid., pp.
                            1231–1239.</note> Our goal has not been to reach easy or transient
                        agreements, but to find solutions that are meaningful, balanced, and
                        lasting.</p>
                    <p>Now, a President has a responsibility to present to the people of this Nation
                        reports and summations of complex and important matters. I feel more secure
                        as President making decisions if I know that either the most difficult, the
                        most complex questions that face me have been understood and debated by you
                        and understood and debated by the Congress.</p>
                    <p>In the past I think our Nation’s leaders have been guilty of making decisions
                        in secret. And even when the decision turns out to be the right one, it
                        makes the President, the Secretary of State speak with a weak voice when
                        they speak alone.</p>
                    <p>Today, I want to discuss a vitally important aspect of our foreign relations,
                        the one that may most directly shape the chances for peace for us and for
                        our children. I would like to spell out my view of what we have done and
                        where we are going in our relations with the Soviet Union and to reaffirm
                        the basic principles of our national policy.</p>
                    <p>I don’t have any apology for talking about foreign affairs at a southern
                        legislative conference, because foreign affairs and those difficult
                        decisions ought never to be made with a concept that we can abandon common
                        sense and the sound judgment and the constructive influence of the American
                        people.</p>
                    <pb n="230" facs="0271" xml:id="pg_230"/>
                    <p>For decades, the central problems of our foreign policy revolved around
                        antagonism between two coalitions, one headed by the United States and the
                        other headed by the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Our national security was often defined almost exclusively in terms of
                        military competition with the Soviet Union. This competition is still
                        critical, because it does involve issues which could lead to war. But
                        however important this relationship of military balance, it cannot be our
                        sole preoccupation to the exclusion of other world issues which also concern
                        us both.</p>
                    <p>Even if we succeed in relaxing tensions with the U.S.S.R., we could still
                        awake one day to find that nuclear weapons have been spread to dozens of
                        other nations who may not be as responsible as are we. Or we could struggle
                        to limit the conventional arsenals of our two nations, to reduce the danger
                        of war, only to undo our efforts by continuing without constraint to export
                        armaments around the world.</p>
                    <p>As two industrial giants, we face long-term, worldwide energy crises.
                        Whatever our political differences, both of us are compelled to begin
                        conserving world energy and developing alternatives to oil and gas.</p>
                    <p>Despite deep and continuing differences in world outlook, both of us should
                        accept the new responsibilities imposed on us by the changing nature of
                        international relations.</p>
                    <p>Europe and Japan rose from the rubble of war to become great economic powers.
                        Communist parties and governments have become more widespread and more
                        varied and, I might say, more independent from one another. Newly
                        independent nations emerged into what has now become known as the Third
                        World. Their role in world affairs is becoming increasingly significant.</p>
                    <p>Both the United States and the Soviet Union have learned that our countries
                        and our people, in spite of great resources, are not all-powerful. We’ve
                        learned that this world, no matter how technology has shrunk distances, is
                        nevertheless too large and too varied to come under the sway of either one
                        or two super powers. And what is perhaps more important of all, we have, for
                        our part, learned, all of us, this fact, these facts in a spirit not of
                        increasing resignation, but of increasing maturity.</p>
                    <p>I mention these familiar changes with which you are familiar because I think
                        that to understand today’s Soviet-American relationship, we must place it in
                        perspective, both historically and in terms of the overall global scene.</p>
                    <p>The whole history of Soviet-American relations teaches us that we will be
                        misled if we base our long-range policies on the mood of the moment, whether
                        that mood be euphoric or grim. All of us can re<pb n="231" facs="0272"
                            xml:id="pg_231"/>member times when relations seemed especially dangerous
                        and other times when they seemed especially bright.</p>
                    <p>We’ve crossed those peaks and valleys before. And we can see that, on
                        balance, the trend in the last third of a century has been positive.</p>
                    <p>The profound differences in what our two governments believe about freedom
                        and power and the inner lives of human beings, those differences are likely
                        to remain; and so are other elements of competition between the United
                        States and the Soviet Union. That competition is real and deeply rooted in
                        the history and the values of our respective societies. But it’s also true
                        that our two countries share many important overlapping interests. Our
                        job—my job, your job—is to explore those shared interests and use them to
                        enlarge the areas of cooperation between us on a basis of equality and
                        mutual respect.</p>
                    <p>As we negotiate with the Soviet Union, we will be guided by a vision of a
                        gentler, freer, and more bountiful world. But we will have no illusions
                        about the nature of the world as it really is. The basis for complete mutual
                        trust between us does not yet exist. Therefore, the agreements that we reach
                        must be anchored on each side in enlightened self-interest—what’s best for
                        us, what’s best for the Soviet Union. That’s why we search for areas of
                        agreement where our real interests and those of the Soviets coincide.</p>
                    <p>We want to see the Soviets further engaged in the growing pattern of
                        international activities designed to deal with human problems—not only
                        because they can be of real help but because we both should be seeking for a
                        greater stake in the creation of a constructive and peaceful world
                        order.</p>
                    <p>When I took office, many Americans were growing disillusioned with
                        détente—President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> had even quit
                        using the word, and by extension, people were concerned with the whole
                        course of our relations with the Soviet Union. Also, and perhaps more
                        seriously, world respect for the essential rightness of American foreign
                        policy had been shaken by the events of a decade—Vietnam, Cambodia, <gloss
                            target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, Watergate. At the same time, we were
                        beginning to regain our sense of confidence and our purpose and unity as a
                        nation.</p>
                    <p>In this situation, I decided that it was time for honest discussions about
                        international issues with the American people. I felt that it was urgent to
                        restore the moral bearings of American foreign policy. And I felt that it
                        was important to put the U.S. and Soviet relationship, in particular, on a
                        more reciprocal, realistic, and, ultimately, more productive basis for both
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>It’s not a question of a “hard” policy or of a “soft” policy, but of a
                        clear-eyed recognition of how most effectively to protect our own secu<pb

                    <p>We’ve looked at the problems in Soviet-American relations in a fresh way, and
                        we’ve sought to deal with them boldly and constructively with proposals
                        intended to produce concrete results. I’d like to point out just a few of
                        them.</p>

                    <p>In the strategic arms limitation talks, confirming and then building on
                        Vladivostok accords, we need to make steady progress toward our long-term
                        goals of genuine reductions and strict limitations, while maintaining the
                        basic strategic balance.</p>
                    <p>We’ve outlined proposals incorporating significant new elements of arms
                        control, deep reductions in the arsenals of both sides, freezing of
                        deployment and technology, and restraining certain elements in the strategic
                        posture of both sides that threaten to destabilize the balance which now
                        exists.</p>
                    <p>The Vladivostok negotiations of 1974 left some issues unresolved and subject
                        to honest differences of interpretation. Meanwhile, new developments in
                        technology have created new concerns—the cruise missile, the very large
                        intercontinental ballistic missiles of the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets are worried about our cruise missiles, and we are concerned about
                        the security of our own deterrent capability. Our cruise missiles are aimed
                        at compensating for the growing threat to our deterrent, represented by the
                        build-up of strategic Soviet offensive weapons forces. If these threats can
                        be controlled, and I believe they can, then we are prepared to limit our own
                        strategic programs. But if an agreement cannot be reached, there should be
                        no doubt that the United States can and will do what it must to protect our
                        security and to ensure the adequacy of our strategic posture.</p>
                    <p>Our new proposals go beyond those that have been made before. In many areas
                        we are in fact addressing for the first time the tough, complex core of
                        longstanding problems. We are trying for the first time to reach agreements
                        that will not be overturned by the next <pb n="234" facs="0275"
                            xml:id="pg_234"/>technological breakthrough. We are trying, in a word,
                        for genuine accommodation.</p>
                    <p>But none of these proposals that I’ve outlined to you involves a sacrifice of
                        security. All of them are meant to increase the security of both sides. Our
                        view is that a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement which just
                        reflects the lowest common denominator that can be agreed upon easily will
                        only create an illusion of progress and, eventually, a backlash against the
                        entire arms control process. Our view is that genuine progress in <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> will not merely stabilize competition in
                        weapons but can also provide a basis for improvement in political relations
                        as well.</p>
                    <p>When I say that these efforts are intended to relax tensions, I’m not
                        speaking only of military security. I mean as well the concern among our own
                        individual citizens, Soviet and American, that comes from the knowledge
                        which all of you have that the leaders of our two countries have the
                        capacity to destroy human society through misunderstandings or mistakes. If
                        we can relax this tension by reducing the nuclear threat, not only will we
                        make the world a safer place but we’ll also free ourselves to concentrate on
                        constructive action to give the world a better life.</p>
                    <p>We’ve made some progress toward our goals, but to be frank, we also hear some
                        negative comments from the Soviet side about <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> and about our more general relations. If these comments
                        are based on a misconception about our motives, then we will redouble our
                        efforts to make our motives clear; but if the Soviets are merely making
                        comments designed as propaganda to put pressure on us, let no one doubt that
                        we will persevere.</p>
                    <p>What matters ultimately is whether we can create a relationship of
                        cooperation that will be rooted in the national interests of both sides. We
                        shape our own policies to accommodate a constantly changing world, and we
                        hope the Soviets will do the same. Together we can give this change a
                        positive direction.</p>
                    <p>Increased trade between the United States and the Soviet Union would help us
                        both. The American-Soviet Joint Commercial Commission has resumed its
                        meetings after a long interlude.<note n="10" xml:id="d52fn10">American and

                        ideological camps, but to expand the realm of independent, economically
                        self-reliant nations, and to oppose attempts at new kinds of
                        subjugation.</p>
                    <p>Part of the Soviet Union leaders’ current attitude may be due to their
                        apparent—and incorrect—belief that our concern for human rights is aimed
                        specifically at them or is an attack on their vital interests.</p>
                    <p>There are no hidden meanings in our commitment to human rights.</p>
                    <p>We stand on what we have said on the subject of human rights. Our policy is
                        exactly what it appears to be: the positive and sincere expression of our
                        deepest beliefs as a people. It’s addressed not to any particular people or
                        area of the world, but to all countries equally, yes, including our own
                        country.</p>
                    <p>And it’s specifically not designed to heat up the arms race or bring back the
                        cold war.</p>
                    <p>On the contrary, I believe that an atmosphere of peaceful cooperation is far
                        more conducive to an increased respect for human rights than an atmosphere
                        of belligerence or hatred or warlike confrontation. The experience of our
                        own country this last century has proved this over and over again.</p>
                    <p>We have no illusions that the process will be quick or that change will come
                        easily. But we are confident that if we do not abandon the struggle, the
                        cause of personal freedom and human dignity will be enhanced in all nations
                        of the world. We’re going to do that.</p>
                    <p>In the past 6 months we’ve made clear our determination—both to give voice to
                        Americans’ fundamental beliefs and to obtain lasting solutions to East-West
                        differences. If this chance to emphasize peace and cooperation instead of
                        animosity and division is allowed to pass, it will not have been our
                        choice.</p>
                    <p>We must always combine realism with principle. Our actions must be faithful
                        to the essential values to which our own society is dedicated, because our
                        faith in those values is the source of our confidence that this relationship
                        will evolve in a more constructive direction.</p>
                    <p>I cannot forecast whether all our efforts will succeed. But there are things
                        which give me hope, and in conclusion I would like to mention them very
                        briefly.</p>
                    <p>This place where I now stand is one of the oldest cities in the United
                        States. It’s a beautiful town of whose culture and urban charm all Americans
                        are proud—just as the people of the Soviet Union are justly proud of such
                        ancient cities as Tbilisi or Novgorod, which there they lovingly preserve,
                        as you do in Charleston, and into which they in<pb n="236" facs="0277"
                            xml:id="pg_236"/>fuse a new life that makes these cities far more than
                        just dead remnants of a glorious historical past.</p>
                    <p>Although there are deep differences in our values and ideas, we Americans and
                        Russians belong to the same civilization whose origins stretch back hundreds
                        of years.</p>
                    <p>Beyond all the disagreements between us—and beyond the cool calculations of
                        mutual self-interest that our two countries bring to the negotiating
                        table—is the invisible human reality that must bring us closer together. I
                        mean the yearning for peace, real peace, that is in the very bones of us
                        all.</p>
                    <p>I’m absolutely certain that the people of the Soviet Union, who have suffered
                        so grievously in war, feel this yearning for peace. And in this they are at
                        one with the people of the United States. It’s up to all of us to help make
                        that unspoken passion into something more than just a dream. And that
                        responsibility falls most heavily on those like you, of course, but
                        particularly like President Brezhnev and me, who hold in our hands the
                        terrible power conferred on us by the modern engines of war.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brezhnev said something very interesting recently, and I quote from his
                        speech: “It is our belief, our firm belief,” he said, “that realism in
                        politics and the will for détente and progress will ultimately triumph, and
                        mankind will be able to step into the 21st century in conditions of peace,
                        stable as never before.”</p>
                    <p>I see no hidden meaning in that. I credit its sincerity. And I express the
                        same hope and belief that Mr. Brezhnev expressed. With all the difficulties,
                        all the conflicts, I believe that our planet must finally obey the Biblical
                        injunction to “follow after the things which make for peace.”</p>
                    <p>Thank you very much.</p>

                        more about the framework within which those decisions are made more than
                        about the decisions themselves.</p>
                    <p>As you well know, the security of the United States is the first
                        responsibility of any Administration. The reason is obvious: Unless the
                        safety of the nation is assured, we can have no reasonable chance of
                        responding effectively to more than our most basic domestic needs.</p>
                    <p>For the last 6 months, with that priority in mind, the President has spent
                        more time on national security than on any other single issue. No doubt,
                        most of you have heard or read about some of the results—the meetings in
                        Moscow on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> [Strategic Arms Limitation

                            33,000 U.S. Army troops from South Korea beginning in 1978 and
                            concluding in 1982 or 1983. On May 11, the Department of State announced

                            administration announced that it had informed the Governments of South
                            Korea and Japan that the United States would remove 6,000 American
                            ground troops from South Korea by the end of 1978. (Bernard Gwertzman,

                        weapons, renewed negotiations over the Panama Canal, even discussions with
                        Cuba and Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>I have heard two conclusions drawn from these activities. The first is that
                        ours is a purely reactive posture that deals with problems only once they
                        have become acute. The second is that beneath the velvet glove of our
                        diplomacy there is another velvet glove. Both conclusions are wrong. Let me
                        tell you why.</p>
                    <p>Most Americans now recognize why the United States, which became heavily
                        involved in world affairs during and after World War II, <pb n="238"
                            facs="0279" xml:id="pg_238"/>continues to remain
                        involved—inextricably—despite Vietnam and the other difficult, if less
                        searing, experiences of the last decade.</p>
                    <p>We cannot afford to see the rest of the world dominated by another power. Our
                        safety depends in large part on an orderly diffusion of power rather than an
                        attempt to concentrate it in our own hands, let alone having it fall into a
                        single power center elsewhere. We need independence, territorial integrity,
                        and freedom from external attack not only for ourselves but for others as
                        well. We recognize that need through our treaty and nontreaty
                        commitments.</p>
                    <p>We would, in my view, find it virtually impossible to preserve our internal
                        liberties if we were an island of democracy in a sea of totalitarianism. We
                        could hardly hope to maintain a stable and expanding economy if we were
                        deprived of external markets. Defense in this modern age would become an
                        almost intolerable burden if we did not have allies to contribute both
                        resources and strategic locations to the collective security. In a time of
                        instant communications, we could hardly insist on human rights at home and
                        silently watch their violation abroad.</p>
                    <p>Maybe it has become a cliche, but we do in fact inhabit an interdependent
                        world. Our own actions have widespread international effects. Decisions by
                        other nations can have a major impact on us as well. The oil embargo of 1973
                        and the subsequent increase in our petroleum imports—which now make up half
                        our oil consumption—constitute only the more obvious index of
                        interdependence. We are bound to care—and care deeply—about what happens in
                        many parts of the world. Because of our power and influence, other nations
                        are bound to care about us; some of them will always seek our involvement in
                        their problems. Isolation today is about as relevant for the United States
                        as the one-horse shay.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps we have been too much of an international busybody in the recent
                        past. But no one can doubt that there remains much to busy us in this
                        dynamic world.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Soviet Challenge</p>
                    <p>Our principal long-term problem continues to be the Soviet Union. Whether we
                        like it or not, the Soviet leadership seems intent on challenging us to a
                        major military competition. To quote a friend and colleague—someone whose
                        professional efforts over the past 15 years have been focused on arms
                        control and who during most of that time has considered that U.S. actions
                        were driving the competition: The principal factor driving the arms race now
                        is the Soviet military buildup, strategic and tactical.</p>
                    <p>The most evident—and dangerous—features of this challenge arise from the
                        steady annual increases, in real terms, in the Soviet de<pb n="239"
                            facs="0280" xml:id="pg_239"/>fense budget, the buildup and improvement
                        of Soviet strategic nuclear forces, the modernization of Soviet ground and
                        tactical air forces in Eastern Europe, and the growing sophistication of
                        Soviet naval forces, which include a gradually expanding capability to
                        project military power at considerable distances from Russia itself.</p>
                    <p>Whatever the motives behind it, the challenge is serious; we must not
                        underestimate it. At the same time, we should recognize that the resulting
                        competition is not an all-out contest compared with arms races of the past.
                        It isn’t a purely military competition either.</p>
                    <p>We are spending a little more than 5 percent of <gloss target="#t_GNP_1"
                            >GNP</gloss> on our defense establishment. Our best current estimate is
                        that the Soviets are allocating between 11 and 13 percent of a much smaller
                            <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> to their military effort, with the
                        bulk of it designed to give them a capability against the United States and
                        its immediate allies, although a significant amount reflects the problem
                        posed by the People’s Republic of China.</p>
                    <p>Both sides—and especially the United States—could invest a great deal more in
                        defense. As of now, however, it would be a mistake to concentrate all our
                        attention or the bulk of our resources on the arms race. The competition
                        reaches into other areas also, and we have comparative advantages in them,
                        whereas in the military arena the present balance and prospective potentials
                        of the two sides are close. In fact we welcome peaceful competition because
                        when it comes to industrial, agricultural, and technological strength; to
                        the efficiency as well as the humaneness of our system; and to relative
                        political influence, we have it all over the Soviet Union, and we can act
                        with the confidence and restraint that knowledge justifies.</p>
                    <p>We must take account of the Soviet challenge at all times. Failure to do so
                        will be dangerous and could be fatal. But there are other trends in the
                        world that could have long-term effects, either helpful or perilous to our
                        security; we must recognize them as well.</p>
                    <p>We have every reason to be encouraged by the revival of freedom in Greece,
                        Portugal, and Spain. We may possibly find some hope in the possible
                        rejection by the Eurocommunists—a posture we must view with caution—of
                        Moscow as the sole font of wisdom and authority. It is even conceivable that
                        some “Socialist” nations, particularly those that do not live right in the
                        shadow of the U.S.S.R., are becoming dissatisfied with having no alternative
                        to dealing with and depending on the hardcore Soviet bloc for their security
                        and well-being. That is the good news.</p>
                    <p>The bad news is that we also face a number of more dangerous developments.
                        Nuclear weapons already are an unprecedented threat to mankind; their
                        continued proliferation—horizontal as well as vertical—can only make matters
                        worse. More generally, the violent settle<pb n="240" facs="0281"
                            xml:id="pg_240"/>ment of disputes seems to be on the increase.
                        Subversion, terrorism, and organized national force are on almost constant
                        display. And their lethality is being heightened by the expanding trade in
                        nonnuclear weapons and technologies. We live in a tough neighborhood.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Current Issues and the U.S. Role</p>
                    <p>It is a neighborhood where, as the result of earlier and often neglected
                        developments, a number of current and potentially explosive issues beg for a
                        solution one way or another. The differences in the Middle East may have
                        been narrowed; they have not disappeared. Racial tensions and clashes in
                        Africa are mounting. The Sino-Soviet dispute is quiescent but by no means
                        extinct. The rising price of oil continues to send periodic shocks through
                        the international economy. We still lack an agreed international law of the
                        seas.</p>
                    <p>The list could be made even longer and more forbidding. But the main point
                        about it is this: While many of the issues may be specialized or regional in
                        nature—and may not even involve the Soviet Union to begin with—they can
                        escalate rapidly to the superpower level unless they are contained, defused,
                        and eventually resolved. We should be concerned about them for many reasons.
                        We must, in any event, be concerned about them on national security
                        grounds.</p>
                    <p>The analogy of the two scorpions in a bottle may not precisely capture the
                        current situation. (It undoubtedly oversimplified the real situation of the
                        past as well. Now, as then, there are lots of other bugs, ants, crickets,
                        butterflies, and also a few vipers in the bottle.) Nonetheless, we should be
                        wary of letting the two scorpions and their bottle be put on top of a powder
                        magazine built over a match factory. The scorpions may be cautious, but
                        someone else could strike a match.</p>
                    <p>It would be tempting to turn our backs altogether on this turbulent and
                        dangerous world. But that choice is no longer open to us. The United States
                        is bound to have a substantial but finite influence on the rest of the
                        world. If other nations do not catch colds when the United States sneezes,
                        they will certainly feel the draft.</p>
                    <p>Our highest hopes for a world of peace and order have not been realized. But
                        our worst fears have not materialized. Utopia is not just around the corner,
                        but Armageddon is not inevitable either. Despite constraints and mistakes,
                        our record of accomplishments has been, on the whole, a good one. Now is not
                        the time to turn away from it.</p>
                    <p>As a nation, we are less inclined than in the 1960’s to see a threat in every
                        alien event—and that is a part of wisdom. But wisdom and inertia are not the
                        same thing. It is true that we could adopt a passive strategy, reacting to
                        events only in the hope of staying out of trouble rather than acting to
                        shape them. But that is not the President’s style. <pb n="241" facs="0282"
                            xml:id="pg_241"/>He does not propose to be an observer or arbitrator;
                        neither do I. He likes to take initiatives; in my own area of
                        responsibility, so do I.</p>
                    <p>We have learned that we cannot mold the international environment at all
                        precisely to our preferences, however altruistic those preferences may be.
                        But we can still try to help create a world that accepts and respects
                        certain fundamental rights of nations—rights such as national sovereignty,
                        territorial integrity, and freedom from unprovoked attack. We may not have a
                        grand design—and I certainly don’t want to propose a pentagonal model—but we
                        can still seek a reasonably peaceful and stable international
                        environment.</p>
                    <p>If that is our goal, as I believe it is, then we must pay attention to the
                        major issues and trends I have noted. The peaceful settlement of disputes is
                        to our interest; it is to everyone’s interest. At the same time, we must
                        adapt to where necessary, and control if possible, the trends which could
                        threaten the nation’s security. A strong national defense is part, but only
                        one part, of that process. Short-term diplomacy and longer run programs to
                        create a more benign international environment must have equal priority.
                        Once that is understood, the outlines of our strategy and posture should
                        become evident.</p>
                    <p>Our actions can be the more restrained, the greater our strength. The glove
                        may be velvet, but friends and foes will find that there is—and will
                        continue to be—a firm hand inside it.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Approach to Issues and Trends</p>
                    <p>As we come to grips with current issues and provide support to our diplomacy,
                        it is essential that we in the national security community abandon old
                        stereotypes. Lord Keynes once claimed that: “Practical men, who believe
                        themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually
                        the slaves of some defunct economist. . . .” Where one issue in particular
                        is concerned, some of us give the impression of becoming the slaves, if not
                        to a defunct economist at least to some strategist from a bygone age.</p>
                    <p>I refer to the Panama Canal. On this issue, in this day and age, it is surely
                        unreasonable to cling to obsolete asserted rights and outmoded claimed
                        privileges at the risk of losing everything—or of preserving our position
                        only at a terrible cost in blood, treasure, and long-term hostility. The
                        issue of the Panama Canal is not the sanctity of treaties or the maintenance
                        of essential U.S. security interests; we have successfully insisted on
                        both.</p>
                    <p>Successful completion of negotiations will result in the United States and
                        the Republic of Panama signing a new treaty binding the two parties until
                        the year 2000. The treaty will guarantee the neutrality of the canal, the
                        access of all U.S. ships to it in peace and war, and U.S. protection of it
                        in collaboration with Panama.</p>
                    <pb n="242" facs="0283" xml:id="pg_242"/>
                    <p>If we do not obtain such a treaty, those rights will just as surely be in
                        jeopardy. According to the best informed military opinion, we can’t defend
                        the canal from a hostile Panama. It is too vulnerable to a sack of
                        dynamite—or to a glove in the gears. Our relations with Latin America will
                        deteriorate. We will be worse off without a reasonable revision of the
                        existing treaty than with one.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, the real issue before us is whether we, as a party to the
                        original treaty, have the imagination, the magnanimity, and the realism to
                        recognize that a number of fundamental social and ethical conditions have
                        changed and that it is in our self-interest to renegotiate the treaty.</p>
                    <p>I believe we have those qualities and that on this issue, as on others, we
                        can make progress in defusing what could otherwise become an explosive
                        situation into which troublemakers might be drawn.</p>
                    <p>Where longer term trends are concerned, the desirability of controling
                        nuclear proliferation cannot be in question from the standpoint of national
                        security. The President’s determination to conserve energy supplies and
                        reduce our dependence on foreign oil makes equally good sense on the same
                        grounds. So do efforts to review outstanding issues with old foes and former
                        adversaries.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Role of Defense</p>
                    <p>Finally, if we are to achieve a reasonable settlement of explosive current
                        issues and have the time to affect longer run trends before they become
                        explosive, we and our allies have work to do in the realm of defense. If we
                        are to bring other and more constructive instruments to bear on
                        international problems, our collective security system must be effective,
                        reliable, and durable.</p>
                    <p>Strength breeds the confidence not only to talk but also to institute
                        constructive change. I regret, in this connection, that I cannot review in
                        detail my trip to the Republic of Korea and Japan.<note n="4"

                        President. But this much I can say: The situation on the Korean Peninsula
                        and in northeast Asia has changed greatly since 1950. <pb n="243"
                            facs="0284" xml:id="pg_243"/>The Sino-Soviet dispute is now a fact of
                        life. No one should doubt that the United States will remain a major power
                        in the western Pacific and East Asia. Our capability for the rapid
                        deployment of U.S. forces has been enhanced and will be strengthened still
                        further.</p>
                    <p>Elements of our tactical Air Force will remain in South Korea, and other
                        units—ground, naval, and air—will be in the theater. The Republic of Korea,
                        for its part, now has twice the population and five times the <gloss
                            target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> of North Korea. Above all, we will
                        continue to work with our Korean ally to assure that any attack from the
                        North can be defeated even after the 4–5-year period during which the U.S.
                        ground forces will be withdrawn from the peninsula. Surely those are
                        powerful conditions of deterrence and stability.</p>
                    <p>Make no mistake about it; we are determined to maintain and modernize our
                        collective security system. We are equally determined, to the extent that
                        the arms competition cannot be brought under control, to strengthen the
                        competitive position of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Where our allies have developed the necessary strengths, we will adjust the
                        collective burdens to assure that our long-term security arrangements remain
                        commensurate with the capabilities and stakes of the partners. Otherwise
                        those arrangements cannot endure.</p>
                    <p>Where technology has produced total or partial substitutes for more
                        traditional weapons systems, and has done the job efficiently, we will—with
                        all due caution—begin the substitution. That, in fact, is the main basis for
                        planning to turn over some of the functions of the penetrating manned bomber
                        to long-range cruise missiles and canceling production of the <gloss
                            target="#t_B1_1">B–1</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Where inefficiencies exist, as in our use of scarce personnel and our
                        maintenance of an excessive base structure—and other overhead—we will attack
                        them as vigorously as our other problems. Furthermore, we will not be
                        deterred from that attack—although we may on occasion be delayed—by domestic
                        political obstacles.</p>
                    <p>Most important of all, where increases in hostile foreign forces threaten our
                        ability to maintain the conditions of collective security, we will insure
                        the restoration of our position. Nothing in history suggests that we can
                        reach our goals from a position of weakness.</p>
                    <p>We are not in a position of weakness in those functions and regions we
                        consider vital to our security. The strategic nuclear balance, despite the
                        Soviet buildup, remains in equilibrium. The balance of tactical power in
                        Europe is more precarious, but it has not yet tilted against <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> to the point where deterrence of the
                        Warsaw Pact is threatened. If another war begins in the Middle East, it will
                        not be because of a lack of Israeli strength. The situation in Korea, in our
                        judgment, is and can be kept militarily stable, despite increases in North
                        Korean offensive <pb n="244" facs="0285" xml:id="pg_244"/>power. And our
                        naval forces still control the sea lanes to Europe, the Middle East, and
                        northeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>There is where we would prefer to halt the military competition and begin the
                        process of equitable arms reduction. From the standpoint of the United
                        States, now is the time to stop the buildup—if others are willing, end the
                        folly of nuclear proliferation, and cease the wasteful transfer of
                        conventional arms in excess of their real needs to developing nations.</p>
                    <p>But we cannot bring about those results unilaterally. If others will not
                        cooperate, we will adapt. Certainly we will not shrink from a world that
                        demands increased strength as well as greater justice.</p>
                    <p>I realize that I have outlined a complex approach to the problems of national
                        security. At times the approach may appear internally inconsistent. It is
                        not. We can move toward the peaceful resolution of international differences
                        only if the conditions of collective security are maintained. We can
                        maintain the conditions of collective security—without excessive cost and
                        risk—only if we move to resolve current international differences and deal
                        constructively with long-term trends.</p>
                    <p>To do both we need moral, diplomatic, and economic—as well as
                        military—strength. We also need your understanding and support.</p>

                    <p>On vacation I read articles reviewing your first six months’ foreign policy
                        which struck me as so silly and superficial—focusing largely on how good or
                        bad our relations were with other governments and <pb n="245" facs="0286"
                            xml:id="pg_245"/>urging you to improve them—that I thought it might be
                        useful to review what had really gone on in the last six months, to see
                        whether more useful lessons could be drawn.</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Risk of War.</hi> The media have always been preoccupied
                        with whether Soviet leaders smile or frown at the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss>. But events since 1945 suggest that the ups and downs of
                        detente are not the main factor shaping the danger of conflict between these
                        two countries: The superpowers are drawn into adversary confrontation more
                        by local crises in other areas than by coolness in their bilateral
                        relations. So in assessing how your policy in the last six months has
                        affected the risk of conflict, we should look to what has happened in
                        potential crisis areas:</p>
                    <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">Middle East.</hi> In the last six months the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> developed a clear policy regarding the
                        principles that should govern a general Middle East settlement. The Arab
                        countries responded with a modest show of flexibility; the Israeli election
                        produced a government less flexible than its predecessors, and its stance is
                        popular at home. So the search for a settlement will be even longer and more
                        difficult than seemed likely a few months ago. But you have defined the kind
                        of settlement that is needed, which is a necessary first step.</p>
                    <p>(b) <hi rend="italic">Korea.</hi> Your announced decision to withdraw <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> forces from Korea involved both potential
                        pluses and minuses.<note n="2" xml:id="d54fn2">See <ref target="#d53fn3"
                                >footnote 3, Document 53</ref>.</note> The <hi rend="italic"
                            >pluses</hi> were twofold: Withdrawal of one brigade in 1978 should
                        permit significant savings if that brigade is disbanded (as one brigade of
                        each of the other two lightly-armed <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> Army
                        divisions has been disbanded); whether or not this is done, eventual
                        withdrawal of all <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> forces will give us the
                        option of confining <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> involvement in any
                        future Korean war to air and sea action. The <hi rend="italic">minus</hi> is
                        that the North Korean government may be more inclined to consider a
                        pre-emptive attack. If the timing of further withdrawals after 1978 can be
                        made dependent on North Korean actions and attitudes, we will have committed
                        ourselves to the right long-term course without enhancing the risk of
                        conflict.</p>
                    <p>(c) <hi rend="italic">Europe.</hi> Six months ago there seemed some danger
                        that the balance of power in Central Europe would shift sufficiently in
                        favor of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to encourage Soviet
                        leaders to mount growing pressure on the West (or perhaps to intervene in a
                        grey situation such as Yugoslavia, if the occasion arose). This risk has
                        been reduced by the program to build up <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> forces that you launched in London.<note n="3"

                    </p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Economic.</hi> The most likely threat to the industrial
                        democracies is not war, but a long-term deterioration in their economic
                        circumstances <pb n="246" facs="0287" xml:id="pg_246"/>due to continuing
                        stagflation. Policies to which the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>
                        contributed in the last six months have somewhat reduced this danger:</p>
                    <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">Macro-Economic Policies.</hi> At London, the seven
                        leading industrial nations committed themselves to sensible growth and
                        stabilization targets for 1977. These commitments strengthened pro-growth
                        groups in the German and Japanese governments, and hence contributed to the
                        German and Japanese expansionist decisions which will probably be taken
                        soon, and which should yield good growth records in 1978, after a dismal
                        German growth record in 1977. Summit stabilization pledges probably also
                        strengthened the commitment of the French, British, and Italian governments
                        to needed and painful anti-inflationary policies.</p>
                    <p>(b) <hi rend="italic">Financial Indebtedness.</hi> In your first six months,
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> played a large role in bringing about
                        international agreement to establish a new $10 billion <gloss

                        months the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> recognized the long-term
                        importance of these two areas and acted accordingly, seeking the basic
                        changes that are needed, rather than the quick fixes that make good news
                        stories.</p>
                    <p>—Instead of accepting a quick and relatively meaningless deal on arms
                        control, the new Administration sought a major reduction in strategic force
                        levels that would enhance nuclear stability, even if it took longer to

                        to provide assurances of nuclear fuel to importing countries and to store
                        spent fuel, it could be one of the most important new advances in global

                    <p>—A shift from the previous Administration’s undue emphasis on strategic

                    <p>—Within general purpose forces, increased emphasis on Europe-oriented forces,
                        which are badly in need of improvement.</p>

                        if agreed to by others, should reduce price fluctuations that are equally

                        aligning it in greater degree with traditional American values. I am
                        sceptical that your human rights policy will do much to change dictatorships
                        around the world and that <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> African policy
                        will avert continuing turmoil in Southern Africa; but I’m also sceptical
                        that either of these policies does any harm, and both policies do
                        considerable good at home—in re-establishing the connection between <gloss

                            >US</gloss> public opinion that was fractured by the seeming opportunism

                        important accomplishments noted above; indeed, it may well be the price of
                        these accomplishments. And it seems to be tapering down, if not a thing of
                        the past, to judge from <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName>’s
                        last visit.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Brezhnev</hi> is annoyed by your human rights campaign.
                        But nothing in the past record of Soviet policy suggests that this will
                        prevent him or his successors from entering into any agreements with us that
                        they conceive to be in the Soviet interest—any more than a <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> retreat from human rights would cause him to
                        offer us substantive concessions. He is probably also put out because you
                        have made clear that progress in the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                        >US</gloss>-Soviet relations depends on concrete agreements; but this was an
                        overdue change in past <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> policy.</p>
                    <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Conclusion.</hi> The success or failure of foreign

                        things about us. It’s determined by whether we’re successful in building the
                        world order to which you pledged yourself in the campaign. This means
                        looking for areas of common interest, particularly with the industrial
                        democracies—but also with developing and Communist coun<pb n="249"

                        international institutions that can give effect to these interests. This
                        takes time. But if you stick with it (instead of being diverted by media
                        demands for instant and superficial successes)—in short, if you do as well
                        in the next 3½ years in focusing on structural problems as you did in the
                        first six months, even the press will admit by 1980 that your Administration
                        has accomplished more than any President since <persName corresp="#p_THS_1"

                            plenary session in which he could “expound systematically your approach

                                <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> offered that the

                            (which is more important than the illusion of cordiality before serious

                        Brezhnev claims he has serious concerns about you and about the general

                        future decisions.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Soviet Perspective</p>
                    <p>Over the next month or so, Brezhnev will be putting the finishing touches on
                        whatever programmatic statement he and the politburo intend to issue in
                        honor of the new constitution and the 60th anniversary of the Bolshevik
                        Revolution. These occasions tend to take on more than a purely ceremonial
                        significance. Probably, there will be an appraisal of the general
                        international situation, and in particular, the future course of
                        Soviet-American relations. While the Soviets could opt for a freeze in
                        relations, Brezhnev’s preference probably is to reinstate “detente.”</p>
                    <p>—He knows that you will certainly be in office to deal with his successor;
                        moreover, the Soviets cannot ignore the fact that the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> has emerged from the Vietnam-Watergate
                        turmoil with a new sense of confidence and thus in a far better strategic
                        position to endure a period of stagnation or even confrontation.</p>
                    <p>—In contrast to our situation, the Soviets are approaching the end of the
                        Brezhnev period which will be symbolized by the new constitution. While this
                        period has been marked by certain Soviet successes in containing dissent at
                        home and in East Europe and in expanding Soviet influence, in the past
                        several years troubles have also grown—in relations with the <gloss

                        The growth of Soviet military power has not provided a basis for permanent
                        political influence, in part because international concerns have broadened
                        to include newer issues in which the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        risks irrelevancy. And, finally, the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>
                        is constrained by the fact that it finds itself deeply indebted to and
                        dependent on the Western world for its economic growth.</p>

                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> has taken the initiative in almost

                    <p>—Constant criticism from the Soviet Union suggests to us that the Soviet

                        campaign against our <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> proposals and

                    <p>—For example, we would give assurances that we do not intend to deploy <gloss

                    <p>—In <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, you have had a chance to discuss

                            >USSR</gloss>, but the Soviet Union must recognize that we have some
                        serious concerns about future strategic relationships; no agreement that
                        ignores these concerns would ever pass the Congress or obtain popular
                        support. Indeed, we could not sign such a treaty.</p>
                    <p>—On the other hand, we have taken account of Soviet concerns, and have gone
                        more than half way to meet them. Our proposals on cruise missiles have a far
                        greater impact on <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> forces than on Soviet
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>—The Soviet response has been discouraging; we cannot engage in a process in
                        which the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> makes a series of proposals but
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> simply rejects them or picks out
                        an isolated element for agreement.</p>
                    <p>In sum, arms control and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> in particular
                        is an area where we can give the relationship a more positive character. Or,
                        it can become a wedge that drives us apart and leads to actions that both
                        sides may regret.</p>
                    <p>As President, you will have to submit a new defense budget to the

                        in your budget.</p>

                            and distinguished guests:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. President, I wish to offer first my congratulations on your election as
                        President of the 32d General Assembly. It gives my own Government particular
                        satisfaction to work under the leadership of a representative from
                        Yugoslavia, a nation with which the United States enjoys close and valued
                        relations. We pledge our cooperation and will depend heavily on your
                        experience and skill in guiding these discussions which we are
                        beginning.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President, I would also like to express again the high esteem in which we
                        hold Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_WK_1">Waldheim</persName>. We
                        continue to benefit greatly from our close consultations with him, and we
                        place great trust in his leadership of this organization.</p>
                    <pb n="256" facs="0297" xml:id="pg_256"/>
                    <p>Thirty-two years ago, in the cold dawn of the Atomic Age, this organization
                        came into being. Its first and its most urgent purpose has been to secure
                        peace for an exhausted and ravaged world.</p>
                    <p>Present conditions in some respects appear quite hopeful, yet the assurance
                        of peace continues to elude us. Before the end of this century, a score of
                        nations could possess nuclear weapons. If this should happen, the world that
                        we leave our children will mock our own hopes for peace.</p>
                    <p>The level of nuclear armaments could grow by tens of thousands, and the same
                        situation could well occur with advanced conventional weapons. The
                        temptation to use these weapons, for fear that someone else might do it
                        first, would be almost irresistible.</p>
                    <p>The ever-growing trade in conventional arms subverts international commerce
                        from a force for peace to a caterer for war.</p>
                    <p>Violence, terrorism, assassination, undeclared wars all threaten to destroy
                        the restraint and the moderation that must become the dominant
                        characteristic of our age.</p>
                    <p>Unless we establish a code of international behavior in which the resort to
                        violence becomes increasingly irrelevant to the pursuit of national
                        interests, we will crush the world’s dreams for human development and the
                        full flowering of human freedom.</p>
                    <p>We have already become a global community, but only in the sense that we face
                        common problems and we share for good or evil a common future. In this
                        community, power to solve the world’s problems, particularly economic and
                        political power, no longer lies solely in the hands of a few nations.</p>
                    <p>Power is now widely shared among many nations with different cultures and
                        different histories and different aspirations. The question is whether we
                        will allow our differences to defeat us or whether we will work together to
                        realize our common hopes for peace.</p>
                    <p>Today I want to address the major dimensions of peace and the role the United
                        States intends to play in limiting and reducing all armaments, controlling
                        nuclear technology, restricting the arms trade, and settling disputes by
                        peaceful means.</p>
                    <p>When atomic weapons were used for the first time, Winston Churchill described
                        the power of the atom as a revelation long, mercifully withheld from man.
                        Since then we have learned in Dürrenmatt’s chilling words that “what has
                        once been thought can never be unthought.”<note n="2" xml:id="d56fn2"
                            >Reference is to Swiss author and playwright Friedrich Dürrenmatt. The

                    <p>If we are to have any assurance that our children are to live out their lives
                        in a world which satisfies our hope—or that they will have a chance to live
                        at all—we must finally come to terms with this enormous nuclear force and
                        turn it exclusively to beneficial ends.</p>
                    <p>Peace will not be assured until the weapons of war are finally put away.
                        While we work toward that goal, nations will want sufficient arms to
                        preserve their security.</p>
                    <p>The United States purpose is to ensure peace. It is for that reason that our
                        military posture and our alliances will remain as strong as necessary to
                        deter attack. However, the security of the global community cannot forever
                        rest on a balance of terror.</p>
                    <p>In the past, war has been accepted as the ultimate arbiter of disputes among
                        nations. But in the nuclear era we can no longer think of war as merely a
                        continuation of diplomacy by other means. Nuclear war cannot be measured by
                        the archaic standards of victory or defeat.</p>
                    <p>This stark reality imposes on the United States and the Soviet Union an
                        awesome and special responsibility. The United States is engaged, along with
                        other nations, in a broad range of negotiations. In strategic arms
                        limitation talks, we and the Soviets are within sight of a significant
                        agreement in limiting the total numbers of weapons and in restricting
                        certain categories of weapons of special concern to each of us. We can also
                        start the crucial process of curbing the relentless march of technological
                        development which makes nuclear weapons ever more difficult to control.</p>
                    <p>We must look beyond the present and work to prevent the critical threats and
                        instabilities of the future. In the principles of self-restraint,
                        reciprocity, and mutual accommodation of interests, if these are observed,
                        then the United States and the Soviet Union will not only succeed in
                        limiting weapons but will also create a foundation of better relations in
                        other spheres of interest.</p>
                    <p>The United States is willing to go as far as possible, consistent with our
                        security interest, in limiting and reducing our nuclear weapons. On a
                        reciprocal basis we are willing now to reduce them by 10 percent or 20
                        percent, even 50 percent. Then we will work for further reductions to a
                        world truly free of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>The United States also recognizes a threat of continued testing of nuclear
                        explosives.</p>
                    <p>Negotiations for a comprehensive ban on nuclear explosions are now being
                        conducted by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. As
                        in other areas where vital national security interests are engaged,
                        agreements must be verifiable and fair. They must be seen by all the parties
                        as serving a longer term interest that justifies the restraints of the
                        moment.</p>
                    <pb n="258" facs="0299" xml:id="pg_258"/>
                    <p>The longer term interest in this instance is to close one more avenue of
                        nuclear competition and thereby demonstrate to all the world that the major
                        nuclear powers take seriously our obligations to reduce the threat of
                        nuclear catastrophe.</p>
                    <p>My country believes that the time has come to end all explosions of nuclear
                        devices, no matter what their claimed justification, peaceful or military,
                        and we appreciate the efforts of other nations to reach this same goal.</p>
                    <p>During the past 9 months, I have expressed the special importance that we
                        attach to controlling nuclear proliferation. But I fear that many do not
                        understand why the United States feels as it does.</p>
                    <p>Why is it so important to avoid the chance that 1 or 2 or 10 other nations
                        might acquire 1 or 2 or 10 nuclear weapons of their own?</p>
                    <p>Let me try to explain why I deeply believe that this is one of the greatest
                        challenges that we face in the next quarter of a century.</p>
                    <p>It’s a truism that nuclear weapons are a powerful deterrent. They are a
                        deterrent because they threaten. They could be used for terrorism or
                        blackmail as well as for war. But they threaten not just the intended enemy,
                        they threaten every nation, combatant or noncombatant alike. That is why all
                        of us must be concerned.</p>
                    <p>Let me be frank. The existence of nuclear weapons in the United States and
                        the Soviet Union, in Great Britain, France, and China, is something that we
                        cannot undo except by the painstaking process of negotiation. But the
                        existence of these weapons does not mean that other nations need to develop
                        their own weapons any more than it provides a reason for those of us who
                        have them to share them with others.</p>
                    <p>Rather, it imposes two solemn obligations on the nations which have the
                        capacity to export nuclear fuel and nuclear technology—the obligations to
                        meet legitimate energy needs and, in doing so, to ensure that nothing that
                        we export contributes directly or indirectly to the production of nuclear
                        explosives. That is why the supplier nations are seeking a common policy,
                        and that is why the United States and the Soviet Union, even as we struggle
                        to find common ground in the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> talks,
                        have already moved closer toward agreement and cooperation in our efforts to
                        limit nuclear proliferation.</p>
                    <p>I believe that the London Suppliers Group must conclude its work as it’s
                        presently constituted so that the world security will be safeguarded from
                        the pressures of commercial competition. We have learned it is not enough to
                        safeguard just some facilities or some materials. Full-scope, comprehensive
                        safeguards are necessary.</p>

                        every facet of the nuclear fuel cycle.</p>
                    <p>The scientists and the policymakers of these nations will face a tremendous
                        challenge. We know that by the year 2000, nuclear power reactors could be
                        producing enough plutonium to make tens of thousands of bombs every
                        year.</p>
                    <p>I believe from my own personal knowledge of this issue that there are ways to
                        solve the problems that we face. I believe that there are alternative fuel
                        cycles that can be managed safely on a global basis. I hope, therefore, that
                        the International Fuel Cycle Evaluation will have the support and the
                        encouragement of every nation.</p>
                    <p>I’ve heard it said that efforts to control nuclear proliferation are futile,
                        that the genie is already out of the bottle. I do not believe this to be
                        true. It should not be forgotten that for 25 years the nuclear club did not
                        expand its membership. By genuine cooperation, we can make certain that this
                        terrible club expands no further.</p>
                    <p>Now, I’ve talked about the special problems of nuclear arms control and
                        nuclear proliferation at length. Let me turn to the problem of conventional
                        arms control, which affects potentially or directly every nation represented
                        in this great hall. This is not a matter for the future, even the near
                        future, but of the immediate present. Worldwide military expenditures are
                        now in the neighborhood of $300 billion a year.</p>
                    <p>Last year the nations of the world spent more than 60 times as much—60 times
                        as much—equipping each soldier as we spent educating each child. The
                        industrial nations spent the most money, but the rate of growth in military
                        spending is faster in the developing world.</p>
                    <p>While only a handful of states produce sophisticated weapons, the number of
                        nations which seek to purchase these weapons is expanding rapidly.</p>
                    <p>The conventional arms race both causes and feeds on the threat of larger and
                        more deadly wars. It levies an enormous burden on an already troubled world
                        economy.</p>
                    <p>For our part, the United States has now begun to reduce its arms exports. Our
                        aim is to reduce both the quantity and the deadliness of the weapons that we
                        sell. We have already taken the first few steps, but we cannot go very far
                        alone. Nations whose neighbors are purchasing large quantities of arms feel
                        constrained to do the same. Supplier na<pb n="260" facs="0301"
                            xml:id="pg_260"/>tions who practice restraint in arms sales sometimes
                        find that they simply lose valuable commercial markets to other
                        suppliers.</p>
                    <p>We hope to work with other supplier nations to cut back on the flow of arms
                        and to reduce the rate at which the most advanced and sophisticated weapon
                        technologies spread around the world. We do not expect this task to be easy
                        or to produce instant results. But we are committed to stop the spiral of
                        increasing sale of weapons.</p>
                    <p>Equally important, we hope that purchaser nations, individually and through
                        regional organizations, will limit their arms imports. We are ready to
                        provide to some nations the necessary means for legitimate self-defense, but
                        we are also eager to work with any nation or region in order to decrease the
                        need for more numerous, more deadly, and ever more expensive weapons.</p>

                        cooperation that we have achieved with the leaders of the nations in the
                        area, as well as those people who are struggling for independence.</p>
                    <p>We urge South Africa and other nations to support the proposed solution to
                        the problems in Zimbabwe and to cooperate still more closely in providing
                        for a smooth and prompt transition in Namibia. But it is essential that all
                        outside nations exercise restraint in their actions in Zimbabwe and Namibia
                        so that we can bring about this majority rule and avoid a widening war that
                        could engulf the southern half of the African Continent.</p>
                    <p>Of all the regional conflicts in the world, none holds more menace than the
                        Middle East. War there has already carried the world to the edge of nuclear
                        confrontation. It has already disrupted the world economy and imposed severe
                        hardships on the people in the developed and the developing nations
                        alike.</p>
                    <p>So, true peace—peace embodied in binding treaties—is essential. It will be in
                        the interest of the Israelis and the Arabs. It is in the interest of the
                        American people. It is in the interest of the entire world.</p>
                    <p>The United Nations Security Council has provided the basis for peace in
                        Resolutions 242 and 338,<note n="8" xml:id="d56fn8">See <ref

                        negotiations in good faith by all parties is needed to give substance to
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>Such good faith negotiations must be inspired by a recognition that all
                        nations in the area—Israel and the Arab countries—have a right to exist in
                        peace, with early establishment of economic and cultural exchange and of
                        normal diplomatic relations. Peace must include a process in which the
                        bitter divisions of generations, even centuries, hatreds and suspicions can
                        be overcome. Negotiations cannot be successful if any of the parties harbor
                        the deceitful view that peace is simply an interlude in which to prepare for
                        war.</p>
                    <p>Good faith negotiations will also require acceptance by all sides of the
                        fundamental rights and interests of everyone involved.</p>

                    <p>For Israel this means borders that are recognized and secure. Security
                        arrangements are crucial to a nation that has fought for its survival in
                        each of the last four decades. The commitment of the United States to
                        Israel’s security is unquestionable.</p>
                    <p>For the Arabs, the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people must be
                        recognized. One of the things that binds the American people to Israel is
                        our shared respect for human rights and the courage with which Israel has
                        defended such rights. It is clear that a true and lasting peace in the
                        Middle East must also respect the rights of all peoples of the area. How
                        these rights are to be defined and implemented is, of course, for the
                        interested parties to decide in detailed negotiations and not for us to
                        dictate.</p>

                        of the world where they have competing interests, because the association of

                    <p>We have all survived and surmounted major challenges since the United Nations
                        was founded. But we can accelerate progress even in a world of
                        ever-increasing diversity.</p>
                    <p>A commitment to strengthen international institutions is vital. But progress
                        lies also in our own national policies. We can work together to form a
                        community of peace if we accept the kind of obligations that I have
                        suggested today.</p>
                    <p>To summarize: first, an obligation to remove the threat of nuclear weaponry,
                        to reverse the buildup of armaments and their trade, and to conclude
                        bilateral and multilateral arms control agreements that can bring security
                        to all of us. In order to reduce the reliance of nations on nuclear
                        weaponry, I hereby solemnly declare on behalf of the United States that we
                        will not use nuclear weapons except in self-defense; that is, in
                        circumstances of an actual nuclear or conventional attack on the United
                        States, our territories, or Armed Forces, or such an attack on our
                        allies.</p>
                    <p>In addition, we hope that initiatives by the Western nations to secure mutual
                        and balanced force reductions in Europe will be met by equal response from
                        the Warsaw Pact countries.</p>
                    <p>Second, an obligation to show restraint in areas of tension, to negotiate
                        disputes and settle them peacefully, and to strengthen peacemaking
                        capabilities of the United Nations and regional organizations.</p>
                    <p>And finally, an effort by all nations, East as well as West, North as well as
                        South, to fulfill mankind’s aspirations for human development and human
                        freedom. It is to meet these basic demands that we build governments and
                        seek peace.</p>
                    <p>We must share these obligations for our own mutual survival and our own
                        mutual prosperity.</p>
                    <p>We can see a world at peace. We can work for a world without want. We can
                        build a global community dedicated to these purposes and to human

                    <p>The view that I have sketched for you today is that of only one leader in
                        only one nation. However wealthy and powerful the United States may be,
                        however capable of leadership, this power is increasingly only relative. The
                        leadership increasingly is in need of being shared.</p>
                    <p>No nation has a monopoly of vision, of creativity, or of ideas. Bringing
                        these together from many nations is our common responsibility and our common
                        challenge. For only in these ways can the idea of a peaceful global
                        community grow and prosper.</p>
                    <p>Thank you very much.</p>

                    <p>We need to look ahead and develop a coherent strategy—including priorities,
                        timing, and yes, linkages—for managing our dealings with the Soviet Union,
                        including the barrage of arms control negotiations, and such major political
                        issues as <gloss target="#t_CSCE_1">CSCE</gloss>, human rights, and the
                        Middle East. We need this strategy to guide our own planning and action, and
                        to make sure we do not run into difficulty with Congress and the public on
                        the Soviet front.</p>
                    <p>For the American public, how the Soviet connection is managed is a central
                        standard for evaluating the foreign policy performance and competence of any
                        administration. The public becomes anxious when they think things are going
                        badly with the Soviets; but they equally—and sometimes more so—become
                        nervous when they think things are going too well because they suspect good
                        relations are being bought with concessions. Above all, the American public
                        wants a sense that the <pb n="265" facs="0306" xml:id="pg_265"/>Soviet
                        connection is under control and that those managing it know what they
                        want.</p>
                    <p>Simply put, we may have something of a problem in how the public sees our
                        conduct of Soviet Affairs. Pat Caddell’s recent poll is one of a number of
                        straws in the wind. It shows a considerable negative shift in opinion
                        concerning performance on Soviet policy and the related area of human
                        rights. To some extent, attitudes toward our Soviet policy reflect a broader
                        concern (one that you are familiar with) that we are trying to do too much
                        too quickly on too many different fronts. To the extent that we can convey
                        coherence and control in our Soviet policy, we will counter this perception
                        and build public confidence in our general foreign policy efforts.</p>
                    <p>A key issue is whether we should try to wrap up <gloss target="#t_CTB_1"
                            >CTB</gloss> with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> in the near
                        term. There is a strong connection between them in that both are about
                        strategic nuclear capabilities—and to conclude both at the same time would
                        be a powerful realization and demonstration of your commitment to the
                        control of nuclear weapons. Indeed, at one point we accelerated our <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> efforts when it seemed that <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> might be indefinitely stalled.</p>
                    <p>This said, it is not clear that it is feasible to get to a <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> in the desired timeframe without conceding
                        points important to us. Indeed, if the Soviets sense that we are eager to
                        wrap <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> up with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss>, they would have a major incentive to link the two and try
                        to wring more concessions from us. There is also a good risk that Congress
                        and the public, rather than applauding the simultaneous conclusion of <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>
                        as two blows struck for peace, instead will question whether we bought the
                        double deal with unwarranted concessions. <gloss target="#t_PNE_1"
                            >PNE</gloss>’s, for example, is an area where we may ultimately have to
                        compromise. But it is such an article of faith on the left and the right
                        that they should stop, that any such concession in the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II timeframe will be scored as a
                        retreat.</p>
                    <p>On balance, I think we need a controlled and phased strategy to guide us
                        through the minefields I have sketched above. I think that a step-by-step
                        approach is not only the best way to handle the Soviets substantively, but
                        also to convey a sense of competence and control to Congress and to the
                        public, and to avoid the sort of progressive euphoria which, in the past,
                        has been followed with sharp questions and suspicions about what it really
                        cost. In essence, I am talking of building and staging our relations and
                        agreements with the Soviets over the span of your first term in office. The
                        timetable might look something like this:</p>
                    <p>—A <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II agreement, combined with a
                        Summit, in late winter or early spring after Panama. It could well take us
                        that long to get there in any event.</p>
                    <pb n="266" facs="0307" xml:id="pg_266"/>
                    <p>—An Indian Ocean stabilization agreement concluded at the same time or
                        perhaps earlier if it looks desirable. It is a moderate step within reach
                        which might help maintain momentum in the relationship, while buying us time
                        on more serious and difficult fronts.</p>
                    <p>—A grey area systems initiative, possibly linked to <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1"
                            >MBFR</gloss>, to follow shortly after <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> II and demonstrate our continued concern for <gloss
                            target="#t_Backfire_1">Backfire</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SS20_1"
                            >SS–20</gloss>’s, etc. We have started planning work on this.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d57fn2">In the right-hand margin next to this point, the
                            President wrote: “I don’t favor deliberate delay—just hold firm on
                                <gloss target="#t_PNE_1">PNE</gloss>, etc &amp; not be in a
                            hurry.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>—A <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> agreement in late 1978, perhaps
                        before the elections.<note n="3" xml:id="d57fn3">Reference is to the
                            November 1978 mid-term elections.</note> Your Spring Summit meeting
                        could be used to open the way.</p>
                    <p>—Intensive negotiations in 1979 looking to the expiration of the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Protocol which coincides with the end
                        of your first term, and is, therefore, a major political benchmark.</p>
                    <p>These are the key elements. A comprehensive plan would have to fit in such
                        negotiations as <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss>, ASAT, <gloss
                            target="#t_CW_1">CW</gloss>, radiological weapons, civil defense, and
                        conventional arms restraints. Each of these could be fitted into a general
                        scheme of steady and controlled progress in our dealings with the Soviets.
                        Indeed, if we want to add something to <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> for a possible Spring Summit, <gloss target="#t_ASAT_1"
                            >ASAT</gloss> in some ways is a more directly related subject and
                        perhaps more feasible on terms acceptable to us, than <gloss
                            target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Finally, a major argument for the approach I am describing is the need to
                        phase the various negotiations and agreements to give the Soviets a
                        continuing incentive to moderate their behavior in our relationship
                        generally. The Soviets have gotten used to some pressure on human rights and
                        their tack now is to down-play the issue and to suggest that we have learned
                        our lesson. You may have to speak out again publicly on the issue to
                        disabuse the Soviets and to head off domestic charges that you are backing
                        off human rights. When you do speak out, the Soviets’ reactions will be
                        moderated to the extent they are enmeshed with us in a controlled process of
                        negotiations, and have something to lose.<note n="4" xml:id="d57fn4">In the
                            right-hand margin next to this paragraph, the President wrote: “Brezhnev
                            attacks on <persName corresp="#p_GAJ_1">[Arthur] Goldberg</persName> are
                            helping us.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Similarly, in the period immediately ahead, getting to Geneva on the Middle
                        East and what happens once we are there will be real tests of Soviet
                        intentions. How they respond cannot be divorced from <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> or any other negotiation. Especially
                        disruptive Soviet behavior in the Middle East could not help but affect
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and, above all, how any <pb

                    <p rend="center">The United States and the Third World</p>
                    <p>I will speak for a while first on the approach of a new Administration to the
                        crucial economic issues we are addressing with the developing nations. The
                        phrase “new Administration” may no longer be accurate after 10 months. But I
                        think we do have an approach to these issues that is new in some of its
                        directions and priorities. Before getting to the specific issues themselves,
                        let me say a few words about context.</p>
                    <p>For many years during the period after World War II, American relations with
                        Latin America, Africa, and Asia were looked at primarily through the prism
                        of the cold war. And especially with regard to Africa and Asia, our concerns
                        for close relations with our traditional allies cut across our inclination
                        to support the movement toward independence by Europe’s colonies.</p>
                    <p>In recent years, we have come to look at the problems of the Third World more
                        in their own right, in terms of realities of the Third World itself. We <hi
                            rend="italic">can</hi> do so because we have come to appreciate better
                        the limits to the influence of both the Soviet Union and the United States
                        in the Third World. We <hi rend="italic">must</hi> do so because of the
                        growing importance of the Third World to us, politically as well as
                        economically, and because <pb n="268" facs="0309" xml:id="pg_268"/>only bad
                        policy ensues when we allow either our global fears or our global hopes to
                        skew our vision of the facts.</p>
                    <p>This is not to say we should be indifferent to the influence of the Soviet
                        Union in the Third World or elsewhere. We and the Soviets have different
                        views of history and of the future; our relationship continues to have
                        competitive, as well as cooperative, elements.</p>
                    <p>But in terms of our own self-interest, we must begin to deal with the
                        developing nations on a basis which takes full account of their growing
                        importance to us. And we should understand that the determination of Third
                        World nations to decide their own policies, their wish to determine their
                        own fates, is a basic protection for the world of diversity we want to see
                        preserved.</p>
                    <p>So it is no longer possible to say that East-West relations or ties among the
                        industrial democracies are more important to us than North-South policies.
                        For different reasons, they are all vital to U.S. interests and to the kind
                        of world we want for our children. Advancement of our objectives in one area
                        cannot be divorced from progress in another. Worldwide energy security, for
                        example, affects the economic welfare of the industrial democracies, the
                        developing world, and the eastern Communist states. Economic cooperation
                        among the United States, Europe, and Japan affects growth in the Third
                        World; by the same token, their economic health is important to our own.</p>
                    <p>Another way of looking at the importance of the U.S.-Third World relationship
                        is to enumerate some of those problems which cannot be solved without their
                        cooperation.</p>
                    <p>• Controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons requires the assistance of
                        India, Iran, Brazil, and Argentina, among others.</p>
                    <p>• Restraining the dangerous growth of conventional arms races must be
                        addressed on every continent.</p>
                    <p>• Human rights, including the economic dimension of those rights, are a
                        concern to us wherever they are in jeopardy.</p>
                    <p>• Managing an economically interdependent world to assure global growth and
                        promote economic equity requires close cooperation between the governments
                        of the industrial democracies and those of the developing nations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Managing the Relationship</p>
                    <p>For many of these first months in office, the Administration has been
                        reviewing—and arguing about—how this complex, interconnected relationship
                        with the developing nations can be managed. Let me summarize some general
                        conclusions we have come up with in six points.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> we must adopt a positive and constructive
                        attitude in addressing international problems encompassing the developing
                            coun<pb n="269" facs="0310" xml:id="pg_269"/>tries. We will seek common
                        ground with these countries, for progress will only be possible when
                        solutions are mutually beneficial to all parties.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Second,</hi> we will recognize in our actions that
                        interdependence is more than a slogan. It requires us, as we fashion our
                        domestic economic policies, to take into account their impact on the rest of
                        the world, including the Third World. Traditionally, the economies of the
                        developing countries have relied upon the economic dynamism of the major
                        industrial economies. We must continue to be reliable on that score. But it
                        is increasingly true that we have a major stake in the health and vitality
                        of the Third World, as well. No less than 35% of our exports went to
                        developing countries, while almost half of our imports came from them.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Third,</hi> the structure of the international system is
                        changing, gradually evolving from a “North” and a “South” into a global
                        community in which all countries have responsibilities as well as rights.
                        Much of the North-South rhetoric has, unfortunately, implied that only the
                        industrial nations have obligations. This cannot be true. If fully accepted,
                        it fosters both paternalism and resentment. Even the phrase “North-South,”
                        and the dichotomy it sets up, obscures the gradations that exist among
                        nations. This analysis does not mean we can—or should try to—split the Group
                        of 77.<note n="2" xml:id="d58fn2">The Group of 77 is a caucus of developing
                            countries formed in 1964 at the first U.N. Conference on Trade and
                            Development to present a unified bargaining position in their
                            negotiations with industrialized countries. It is now composed of 115
                            developing countries. [Footnote in the original.]</note> But as the
                        economies of developing countries advance from one level to another, it is
                        important that they show increasing concern for the global welfare. They
                        will have a growing stake in the common good.</p>
                    <p>Key oil-producing nations, for example, now ponder the damaging effect of
                        rising oil prices on the health of the global economic system and,
                        therefore, on their own long-term economic development. Even small oil price
                        rises can easily wipe out the gains which the Third World could reap from
                        aid, investment, and loans from the industrial nations. Treasury Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWM_1">Blumenthal</persName> calculated the other
                        day that each percentage point of increase in oil prices adds $400 million
                        to the U.S. energy cost; it has an even more devastating impact on other
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Each nation must also face its responsibilities to its own citizens, who are
                        most in need—and our own country is no exception. However well-functioning
                        the international economic system, development is fundamentally a challenge
                        for each government and society to address in its own terms.</p>
                    <pb n="270" facs="0311" xml:id="pg_270"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Fourth,</hi> while our policies must be global in their
                        concept, their implementation must be specific to each situation. Policies
                        must be tailored to take into account the great diversities that exist among
                        the developing countries.</p>
                    <p>For the economically stronger countries, the most appropriate areas of
                        cooperation are trade and access to private capital and technology. Most of
                        Latin America is now in this position. While aid still plays an important
                        role in the region, its prosperity depends primarily upon the continuing
                        evolution of an open international financial and trading system in which
                        developing countries can participate ever more fully.</p>
                    <p>For the poorer nations, including most African countries, official
                        development assistance—foreign aid—remains the vital source of external
                        capital. Africa will benefit from the intention of the World Bank—and of our
                        own Agency for International Development—to focus concessional assistance on
                        the nations most in need.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Fifth,</hi> we accept the diverse models of economic and
                        political development that the less developed countries (<gloss
                            target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s) have chosen to benefit their peoples.
                        But we also believe that certain human rights have universal application.
                        Human rights include not just the basic rights of due process, together with
                        political freedoms, but also the right of each human being to a just share
                        of the fruits of one’s country’s production.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Sixth,</hi> we recognize that the economic and social
                        issues we all face—such as protecting the environment and the oceans—are
                        global problems from which Communist countries are not immune and to which
                        they can and should make a positive contribution. Consequently, it will be
                        our policy to encourage a constructive role by the centrally planned
                        economies—to increase their development assistance generally and to join us
                        and developing countries in a global development effort.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Basic North-South Issues</p>
                    <p>These six principles only have meaning, of course, in terms of the specific
                        issues we face: liberalizing trade, insuring adequate balance-of-payments
                        financing, improving our foreign assistance performance and reorienting its
                        focus in the direction of poor people, stabilizing commodity price
                        fluctuations, and facilitating the flow of investment and technology on
                        terms fair to companies and governments. Underlying many of these issues,
                        however, are at least three basic tensions.</p>
                    <p>1. We frequently face difficult choices between our short-term and our longer
                        term interests.</p>
                    <p>2. We sometimes confront a tension between what we consider to be sound
                        economic policy and, at the same time, our desire to maintain <pb n="271"
                            facs="0312" xml:id="pg_271"/>a positive momentum in our political
                        relationships with the developing nations.</p>
                    <p>3. On almost every issue, we must find ways to enhance the participation of
                            <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s in international decisionmaking
                        in a way that is acceptable to them and to us.</p>
                    <p>Let me say a word about each.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">First, trade-offs between short-term and longer term
                            interests.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>We are, as you know, in a period of economic difficulties, both in the United
                        States and abroad. Governments everywhere are under pressure to respond to
                        the immediate plight of their citizens, particularly the need to protect
                        jobs. This results in at least two policy dilemmas for the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>• It is axiomatic that a liberal trade regime is in the interest of both the
                        developed and the developing nations. Freer trade can promote the long-term
                        development of the resources the world needs, provide lower prices and
                        greater choice for consumers, and increase opportunities for producers in
                        all countries. Trade can be an engine for economic development and a means
                        for developing nations to participate in the international economic system.
                        All this is accepted in principle, as the stated goal of all countries
                        participating in the current multilateral trade negotiations in Geneva. But
                        the harsh political reality is that these longer term benefits are
                        threatened by short-term protectionism.</p>
                    <p>The United States has been in the forefront in encouraging the negotiations
                        to move forward. We must continue to do so, while seeking to cushion the
                        impact of immediate dislocations. In the months ahead the United States will
                        be vigorously pushing for trade liberalizing measures in the current trade
                        negotiations in Geneva. We will be giving special attention to products of
                        interest to <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s. And we will do our best
                        to work with other countries to devise trading rules which promote trade
                        between the developed and developing world.</p>
                    <p>• Another example of the need—and the difficulty—in protecting the future
                        against shorter term pressures is the issue of foreign assistance. Our
                        foreign aid program has undergone many changes over the past decade, from
                        the large, capital-intensive programs of the 1960’s to the small programs we
                        now increasingly support—much of which is focused on rural development.</p>
                    <p>This Administration intends to give more priority to development assistance
                        than it received throughout the 1970’s. We see these development programs as
                        an integral part of our overall strategy of promoting flows of development
                        finance, as the most efficient and direct method of transferring resources
                        to countries which do not have full access to private capital markets, and
                        as the most direct way to attack poverty.</p>
                    <pb n="272" facs="0313" xml:id="pg_272"/>
                    <p>We believe that larger and more effective foreign assistance
                        programs—bilateral and multilateral—are in the U.S. national interest and in
                        the interest of global development. So year by year, it is increasingly
                        important to convince the Congress and the public that devoting resources to
                        the fight against poverty abroad is tied to the ultimate health of our
                        economy here at home.</p>
                    <p>The Administration consequently faces the challenge of demonstrating to
                        American citizens that foreign assistance works—that it can, together with
                        other policies, make a difference in the global food, energy, or population
                        balance and that it can, by mobilizing the assistance of other donors and
                        encouraging sound domestic policies on the part of recipients, stimulate
                        growth and equity.</p>
                    <p>Let me say another word about our approach to foreign assistance. Our focus
                        on meeting basic human needs, which is an integral part of our overall human
                        rights policy, is not as simple as it may appear. We face at least two basic
                        challenges here.</p>
                    <p>• In some cases, we face a dilemma when we consider foreign assistance for
                        countries where political and economic human rights are denied. Our
                        assistance is targeted on improving the economic conditions of poor people.
                        Since aid is generally government-to-government, the regime concerned
                        inevitably derives some political boost from our assistance. But we do not
                        want to deprive poor people because of the nature of their government. In
                        such cases, our decisions must be made on a pragmatic, case-by-case basis
                        and very human terms.</p>
                    <p>• In addition, meeting basic human needs is not, in our view, a welfare
                        program but a way for a country and a society to develop. Accordingly, we
                        will encourage host governments to make an increasing commitment of their
                        own to the needs of their poor, at the same time as we increase our aid to
                        them. Many developing countries faced with balance-of-payments problems,
                        high energy prices, and the need for massive domestic investment, may resist
                        placing a priority emphasis on the well-being of their poor. Because the
                        poor are often excluded from the political process, their concerns are given
                        less weight by governing elites. If we place conditions on our aid, these
                        elites could charge us with attempting to intervene in their internal
                        affairs. Our challenge is to be sensitive to their concerns, while promoting

                        <hi rend="italic">A second dilemma which underlies our North-South efforts
                            is the need both to maintain a cooperative multilateral political
                            environment for discuss-ing economic issues while expressing our
                            differences over what are the soundest and most effective economic
                            policies that can serve our common long-term interests.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>I can think of two cases where this issue has arisen. In the area of
                        commodity policy, the developing nations have proposed the negotia<pb
                            n="273" facs="0314" xml:id="pg_273"/>tion of an integrated commodity
                        program for 18 different raw materials. The idea is to relate international
                        efforts to address the problem of each commodity market through a common
                        financing mechanism—a common fund. This proposal has assumed a strong
                        political significance in the North-South dialogue.</p>
                    <p>The United States and other industrial nations agree with Third World leaders
                        that commodity issues are of central importance to the world economy and to
                        the economic development of many countries. But we are convinced that
                        effective measures can be devised only if each market is addressed as an
                        individual case and that these individual arrangements form the best basis
                        for a common commodity policy and funding arrangement. Negotiations on this
                        question begin November 7.<note n="3" xml:id="d58fn3">Negotiations on the
                            Common Fund (see <ref target="#d47fn7">footnote 7, Document 47</ref>)
                            opened in Geneva on November 7. (“Third World’s Hopes for Common Fund
                            Seem Dim as Commodities Parley Opens,” <hi rend="italic">The Wall Street
                                Journal,</hi> November 8, 1977, p. 16)</note> We will enter them in
                        the hope that we can advance a positive and realistic position. We face the
                        challenge of supporting what we consider sound economic policies, while
                        working to maintain a constructive negotiating atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>Another such area is debt. Developing countries have been seeking generalized
                        forgiveness of past official debt, which many of them see as a structural
                        impediment to future development.</p>
                    <p>We seek to respond to such financial needs by arranging additional resource
                        transfers, through bilateral and multilateral foreign assistance. But our
                        analysis shows that every debtor is in a different situation. Some have
                        little problem managing their debts. Others face only a temporary difficulty
                        in servicing their loans. Still others may face long-term structural
                        problems characterized by an inadequate net flow of financial resources.</p>
                    <p>In cases of extreme and urgent need, obviously we stand prepared to discuss
                        debt rescheduling. But in the divergent circumstances we face, we believe
                        any generalized debt forgiveness would be inadvisable. First, the benefits
                        to debtors would bear little relationship to their development needs, since
                        some nations with the largest debts are growing fast and can more easily
                        service them. Second, by treating all countries alike, we would, in effect,
                        be discriminating against those countries which have struggled to pursue
                        policies to reduce their indebtedness over time. And third, a general debt
                        moratorium would be seized upon by those who have traditionally cried
                        “giveaway” at any effort to transfer resources to the Third World.</p>

                            relations is the need to expand <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>
                            participation in the management of the world economy.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>One of the major drives behind the new international economic order is Third
                        World desire for greater political participation in the global economy. The
                        developing nations want not only a larger slice of the global pie, they want
                        to be at the table when the pie is sliced and have a voice in its
                        apportionment.</p>
                    <p>We are convinced that it is essential to widen the circle of international
                        decisionmaking. We believe that the economic system must be fair, and
                        equally important, it must be seen as fair. But going from principle to
                        practice presents us with difficult issues.</p>
                    <p>• First, there is the question of how broadbased global economic management
                        can be. While we live in a world of sovereign nations, it is also a world of
                        states which are unequal in their ability to influence the system, for good
                        or bad. Thus it is exceedingly difficult for the international community,
                        including developing countries themselves, to select which developing
                        countries should play the largest role.</p>
                    <p>• There is also the practical question of which management arrangements and
                        institutions should be expanded. Should the most advanced developing
                        countries be invited to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
                        Development? Would they want to? Should their voice and vote be enlarged in
                        international financial institutions, and if so, are they willing to
                        undertake commensurate obligations? Should we make a special effort to
                        incorporate <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s into institutions which
                        have yet to be created—such as for energy or the oceans? These are some of
                        the issues we are addressing now.</p>
                    <p>To summarize, I think it is fair to say that despite the increasing
                        complexities of North-South relations and the conceptual as well as
                        practical problems we face, the Administration has made considerable
                        progress in formulating a set of positive development policies.</p>
                    <p>• We are intent on making substantial increases in our foreign assistance,
                        while emphasizing the focus on meeting basic human needs.</p>
                    <p>• On commodities, we reversed the policy of previous years and have accepted
                        the principle of a common fund to facilitate buffer stocks.</p>
                    <p>• We have agreed to an expansion of World Bank activities, also a reversal of
                        previous policy.</p>
                    <p>• The Administration has agreed to the expansion of International Monetary
                        Fund lending and is now seeking congressional agreement.</p>
                    <p>• In the trade negotiations, we are willing to reduce trade barriers on
                        products of special interest to <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s.</p>
                    <pb n="275" facs="0316" xml:id="pg_275"/>
                    <p>• We will vigorously negotiate for a system of internationally coordinated
                        national food reserves.</p>
                    <p>• And for once, we are taking the United Nations very seriously on economic
                        and social issues.</p>
                    <p>The general principles I have suggested tonight are only a shorthand for
                        reality. This is especially true when one speaks in the abstractions of
                        economics. Our statistics and our analyses concern the lives of billions of
                        people in the coming generation—people here in America and people abroad. If
                        we turn inward, toward protectionism and indifference, the human cost would
                        be intolerably high. That is the essential problem we will be addressing on
                        almost every foreign policy issue we now face.</p>
                    <p>Contributions of scholars such as yourselves can be threefold.</p>
                    <p>• Your objective analyses of events in Latin America and Africa are valuable
                        as scholarship. They are also valuable for policymakers trying to understand
                        the facts with which we must deal.</p>
                    <p>• Equally valuable would be your thoughts on some of the policy dilemmas I
                        have discussed. I am quite sincere in hoping each of you will consider
                        writing me with your views and suggestions. Asking you to do so is one of
                        the reasons I came here.</p>
                    <p>• And finally, whatever your views, let me urge you to press them on
                        decisionmakers in both the executive branch and the Congress and to
                        contribute to the public debate on these issues.</p>
                    <p>Such involvement may seem, to many of you, inconsistent with the objectivity
                        of a scholar. I have no quarrel with such an individual conclusion. But
                        before reaching it, I hope you will consider one point.</p>
                    <p>We are emerging now from the most contentious period in the last 100 years of
                        our nation’s history. The war in Vietnam so engaged the passions of us
                        all—as it should have done—that we began to think too easily about all
                        policy issues in terms of simple categories: right or wrong, interventionism
                        or noninterventionism, <hi rend="italic">realpolitik</hi> or idealism.</p>
                    <p>As I have tried to suggest tonight, the time has passed when we can think in
                        the simple terms of any doctrine, whether derived from Munich or Vietnam.
                        The complexities of our challenges, the necessary breadth of our priorities,
                        and the depth of our dilemmas elude such simple formulas.</p>
                    <p>If we are to have a decent public debate on our policies—which we want—and if
                        we are to show how progressive policies abroad are in our long-term national
                        interest—as we must—then there can be no substitute for the participation in
                        those debates of scholars such as yourselves. For one essence of scholarship
                        is to help us comprehend more clearly the complexities we must address,
                        without retreat to a world of comforting simplicity.</p>

                    <p>On December 20, 1977, President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Zbigniew Brzezinski</persName> held a press
                        briefing at the White House from 10:35 to 11:10 a.m. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> devoted the briefing to placing
                        President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Jimmy Carter</persName>’s upcoming
                        trip to Poland (December 29–31), Iran (December 31–January 1), India
                        (January 1–3), Saudi Arabia (January 3–4), Egypt (January 4), France
                        (January 4–5), and Belgium (January 6) within the broader context of the
                        administration’s foreign policy. He explained that the administration
                        understood this trip, and another trip scheduled for the spring of 1978, as
                        “reflecting a recognition of the need for the United States to pursue a
                        wider foreign policy more identified with global change and more responsive
                        to global diversity.” Continuing, he indicated that the President’s May 22
                        commencement address at the University of Notre Dame (see <ref target="#d40"
                            >Document 40</ref>) foreshadowed the need for this type of policy,
                        adding:</p>
                    <p>“Our point of departure is the view that we are living in a time in which the
                        world is experiencing the most extensive and the most intensive
                        transformation in its entire history. There are obviously many ways of
                        defining the nature of that transformation. But I think it is doubtlessly
                        true that one of its very key aspects is the phenomenon of global political
                        awakening.</p>
                    <p>“In other words, a world that was politically and socially passive is now
                        becoming truly activist. The consequence of this is a rising crescendo of
                        political and social demands worldwide. It thus represents an altogether new
                        reality in the totality of our common experience. It is on the implication
                        of this that I would like to focus my remarks.”</p>
                    <p> then referenced three substantial phenomena of what he termed this “global
                        political awakening.” These included the collapse of Western colonialism,
                        the primacy of the nation-state as a form of political organization, and an
                        increase in world population. He then identified four additional aspects
                        related to changes in the international system: the division of the world
                        into key clusters, the dispersal of <pb n="279" facs="0320" xml:id="pg_279"
                        />world power, the “fading of single ideological or revolutionary models,”
                        and the division of labor in the world economy.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the concept of a political “awakening,” <persName
                            corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> concluded his remarks by
                        sketching out the potential impact on U.S. policy:</p>
                    <p>“What are the broad policy implications of this? Let me suggest four basic
                        implications. The first is that the relevance of the West to the politically
                        awakening world has to be largely on the level of creative innovation. That
                        innovation has to operate both on the material as well as on the spiritual
                        level.</p>
                    <p>“On the material level, if the world—if the Western world—is willing to
                        accept the reality of interdependence and channel it into constructive
                        directions, it will have a very important role to play and especially so if
                        it accepts the notion of a certain humanistic responsibility for changes
                        which are not only profound, but potentially positive. We are dealing with
                        changes which involve for the first time the emergence of a community in
                        which there is greater responsiveness to the demands and needs of other
                        societies than our own. Thus, a great deal depends on the West’s collective
                        ability to deal with the problems of the South, particularly in the
                        North-South context and on the level of the material response. Creative
                        interdependence means reforming the existing institutions, adjustment and
                        acceptance of certain new realities. On the spiritual level, this means
                        acknowledgment of the reality of human rights defined very broadly, not only
                        in terms of liberty, but also in social terms.</p>
                    <p>“Secondly, and closely connected with it, is the need for a wider economic
                        system. For many years to come I think we will be preoccupied with the very
                        difficult process of how to widen the existing political and economic
                        international system. Here again I think it is useful to reflect on our own
                        domestic experience.</p>
                    <p>“The last 100 years or so of American social and political experience
                        involved the widening of participation for political groups, for social
                        groups in the American system as a whole. Ultimately, and most recently this
                        process involved blacks and women, but earlier the whole struggle of the
                        trade union movement was a struggle over participation and the right to
                        organize.</p>
                    <p>“On the global scale, we need to widen the scope of the international system
                        beyond the purely Atlanticist connection, to reform the international system
                        that was designed after 1945 for a reality which has profoundly altered.</p>
                    <p>“Thirdly, we will have to anticipate the consequences of regional conflicts
                        and try to deal with them before they escalate. If regional conflicts become
                        simultaneously North-South and East-West conflicts, they will be very
                        difficult to control. We see the potential for such con<pb n="280"
                            facs="0321" xml:id="pg_280"/>junction or intersection between East-West
                        and North-South issues in Southern Africa, or in the Middle East, or even
                        potentially in Central America if the Panama Canal [Treaty] is rejected.</p>
                    <p>“Finally, we have to respond to the new issues that are truly for the first
                        time global in character, global in character in terms of such issues as
                        nuclear proliferation, arms transfers and, last but not least, human
                        rights.</p>
                    <p>“All of that is part of a process of responding to altogether new
                        circumstances in which the very character of the international system is
                        changing. The President’s trip is part of our effort to respond to that. It
                        is designed to show that we recognize this change, that we want to be
                        associated with it, and that we want to give it positive direction.</p>
                    <p>“This is why he is visiting some advanced industrial democracies, notably
                        France and Belgium; a relatively more open communist country involved in
                        East-West relations—Poland; richer but still developing countries, Iran and
                        Saudi Arabia; and a developing democracy, India.</p>
                    <p>“Similarly, Brazil, Venezuela, Nigeria fit these categories.</p>
                    <p>“In effect, we want to demonstrate that the time has come for a wider
                        American foreign policy in its scope, a foreign policy which recognizes
                        ideological pluralism and which is willing to work towards a broader
                        political and economic international system.” (Carter Library, National

                            Carter</persName> participated in an interview with <persName
                            corresp="#p_BT_1">Tom Brokaw</persName> of <gloss target="#t_NBC_1"
                            >NBC</gloss> News, <persName corresp="#p_SB_1">Bob Schieffer</persName>
                        of <gloss target="#t_CBS_1">CBS</gloss> News, <persName corresp="#p_MR_2"
                            >Robert MacNeil</persName> of the Public Broadcasting Service and
                        co-host of “The <persName corresp="#p_MR_2">MacNeil</persName>–Lerher
                        Report,” and <persName corresp="#p_WB_1">Barbara Walters</persName> of
                            <gloss target="#t_ABC_1">ABC</gloss> News. The interview took place in
                        the Red Room of the White House, beginning at 8 p.m., and was broadcast live
                        on radio and television. The President began the broadcast by noting:</p>
                    <p>“This year we have had fireside chats and television programs and telephone
                        call-in shows and press conferences twice a month from almost every State in
                        the Nation. And I’ve been very pleased to stay in touch with the American
                        people.</p>
                    <pb n="281" facs="0322" xml:id="pg_281"/>
                    <p>“Tonight we have four distinguished news reporters from the four major
                        networks in our country. And I want to welcome you here as another
                        opportunity for me to speak to the American people with tough interrogations
                        from those who understand our country very well.”</p>
                    <p>The President subsequently fielded questions about his upcoming trip (see
                            <ref target="#d60">Document 60</ref>), the Middle East, the potential
                        for a strategic arms limitation agreement in 1978, and domestic issues
                        related to the Federal Reserve and the economy. In response to a question
                        posed by <persName corresp="#p_WB_1">Walters</persName> as to the
                        administration’s top priorities for 1978, <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> indicated that the status of the Panama Canal Treaty
                        existed as one of the most important issues to resolve:</p>
                    <p>“About 75 years ago in the middle of the night the American Secretary of
                        State signed the Panama Canal Treaty that presently is in existence. No
                        Panamanian has ever signed it; no Panamanian ever saw it before it was
                        signed. It was signed by a Frenchman who benefitted financially from the
                        terms of the treaty on behalf of the Panamanians.</p>
                    <p>“That treaty gave us a chance to do a tremendous job in building the Panama
                        Canal, keeping it open for international shipping. It’s helped our country a
                        lot. It’s something of which we can be proud.</p>
                    <p>“Presidents <persName corresp="#p_EDD_1">Eisenhower</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> recognized that the present treaty
                        was inadequate. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB_1">Johnson</persName>
                        started negotiations to change it. Presidents <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                            >Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>
                        continued. And we concluded it this year.</p>
                    <p>“It’s one of the most difficult political questions that we’ll have to deal
                        with. It’s going to take a lot of time in the Congress to pass it.</p>
                    <p>“What we wanted was one that treated us and Panama fairly, and we got it. We
                        wanted a treaty that did not put a financial burden on the American
                        taxpayer, and we got it. We wanted treaties that would guarantee proper
                        operation of the Panama Canal itself, for us and for foreign shipping, and
                        we got it. We wanted treaties that would also guarantee us permanently the
                        right to take what action we think necessary to keep the canal safe, to
                        defend it, and to keep it open for us to use, and we got it.</p>
                    <p>“We wanted treaties—two treaties there are—that would give us the right for
                        expeditious passage in time of need or emergency, for our ships to go to the
                        head of the line and go through the canal without delay, and we got it. We
                        wanted treaties also that would be acceptable in the eyes of the
                        international community, particularly in Latin America, and we got them.</p>
                    <p>“So, this is what we have tried to do under four Presidents, and we have
                        finally succeeded. And I would say that would be one of the most difficult
                        challenges that we have politically this year. It is absolutely crucial that
                        the Senate ratify these treaties, and I think the terms are very favorable
                        to us and to Panama.</p>
                    <pb n="282" facs="0323" xml:id="pg_282"/>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Brokaw</persName>. You’ve got all that in
                        the treaty, Mr. President. Do you have the votes in the Senate?</p>
                    <p>“The President. I think we will get the votes in the Senate.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BT_1">Brokaw</persName>. Do you not now have
                        them?</p>
                    <p>“The President. I can’t say for sure that we do because many Senators still
                        haven’t expressed their commitment to me or their opinion. But I was talking
                        to President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> this past week,
                        who’s strongly supportive of the treaties, along with Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> and others, and he said that in
                        his speeches to college groups and others around the Nation, that he is
                        getting an increasingly favorable response from the audience. I think public
                        opinion is building up for the treaties as they know the terms of them.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MR_2">MacNeil</persName>. Could we interpret this
                        as the beginning of a new campaign on your part to get out and sell the
                        treaty? You’ve been criticized for having left the ground to the opposition
                        somewhat. Are you going to make a major effort personally to try and sell
                        it?</p>
                    <p>“The President. Yes. I consider it one of my most important
                        responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MR_2">MacNeil</persName>. And you can meet the
                        deadline that President <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName> has
                        set of April, which he says is urgent, and that Panama’s patience could be
                        exhausted.</p>
                    <p>“The President. Well, no, I don’t feel any constraint to operate under a
                        deadline. But both Senator <persName corresp="#p_BRC_1">Byrd</persName> and
                        I and the leaders of the Senate all hope that we can resolve that issue
                        early in the year, certainly I think by April.</p>
                    <p>“Ms. <persName corresp="#p_WB_1">Walters</persName>. On that—since, by the
                        way, just to get back to my original questions—it seems that your priorities
                        next year are very similar to your priorities this year, energy and the
                        economy. But in October, you and President <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> issued a statement—a joint statement to remove
                        doubts about the rights of the United States to defend the neutrality of the
                        canal and also the right of ships to pass promptly through it. A number of
                        Senators have felt that they might be more comfortable with this if it were
                        actually written into the treaty.</p>
                    <p>“Would you be willing to see the treaty amended so that it would reflect this
                        understanding, this statement between you and General <persName
                            corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>?</p>
                    <p>“The President. No. I think it would be good to have a signed agreement
                        between me and President <persName corresp="#p_THO_1">Torrijos</persName>,
                        and he has indicated he would be glad to sign that statement that was made,
                        and of course, I would too. I think the Senate could express an
                        understanding that the treaty was being approved by them with the
                        understanding that this was a proper interpretation. But to actually amend
                        the treaty would re<pb n="283" facs="0324" xml:id="pg_283"/>quire Panama to
                        have another referendum on the subject, and they’ve already had one.</p>
                    <p>“Many people in Panama think that the treaties are too favorable to the
                        United States. And I don’t think it would be fair to them after they
                        negotiated in good faith to cause them to have a completely new referendum.
                        I would certainly hate to have two ratification votes in the Senate,
                        separated by several months. So, I think that the Senate can very well
                        express its understanding of what the treaties mean. We can exchange
                        documents with the Panamanian leader. To amend the treaties, though, I think
                        would be inadvisable.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName

                            President under a January 13 cover memorandum, noting that he, <persName

                                target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> Staff had prepared it and suggesting
                            that parts of the memorandum might be shared with top congressional
                            leaders and a “friendly columnist.” He also recommended that the
                            President provide a copy to <persName corresp="#p_CER_1">Rosalynn
                                Carter</persName>, as he believed the First Lady would “find it
                            informative.” The President wrote “no” on the cover memorandum next to
                            the recommendation that the memorandum be shared with congressional
                            leaders and the press; however, he underlined Rosalynn’s name and wrote
                            “ok” in the margin. The First Lady added the following notation: “Zbig,
                            I made very few comments but found it very interesting. I’d think some
                            of it could be presented to press. R.” In the top right-hand corner of
                            the cover memorandum, the President wrote: “Zbig—I read it all &amp;
                            agree with most of it.”</note>

                    <p>The international position of the United States at the end of 1976 was not
                        good.</p>
                    <p>Our Allies were uneasy about our constancy, our will, and our ability to
                        lead. Our adversaries were openly speculating about the political
                        consequences of “the general crisis of capitalism.” The Third World was
                        generally hostile or disappointed. The American public distrusted our
                        policies and deplored the apparent lack of moral content in our actions and
                        goals.</p>
                    <p>More generally, there was a widespread sense abroad that the United States
                        was fearful of global change, indifferent to the newly surfacing aspirations
                        of mankind, and thus unable to exercise creative leadership, designed to
                        propel historical change in the right directions.</p>

                    <p>U.S. foreign policy was clearly in need of broad renovation. Your
                        Administration recognized the need to move on a wide front, to deal with a
                        variety of complex issues—thus making a break with the predominant pattern
                        of U.S. foreign policy in previous years. That pattern had largely involved
                        a heavy concentration on the U.S.-Soviet relationship, with most other
                        aspects of foreign policy being derivative of that relationship.</p>
                    <p>Instead, the new Administration accepted the reality of complexity and of
                        change, and it placed emphasis not so much on maneuver, but on building new
                        relationships with friends, with adversaries, with the developing world,
                        even with the whole world—in the hope thereby of <pb n="289" facs="0330"
                            xml:id="pg_289"/>renovating the existing international system. In so
                        doing, it was motivated by the following central objectives:</p>
                    <p>1. To engage Western Europe, Japan, and other advanced democracies in closer
                        political cooperation, thereby also promoting wider macro-economic
                        coordination among them.</p>
                    <p>2. To weave a worldwide web of bilateral, political, and, where appropriate,
                        economic cooperation with the new emerging regional powers, thereby
                        extending our earlier reliance on Atlanticism to include such newly
                        influential countries as Venezuela, Brazil, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Iran,
                        India, Indonesia in a wider pattern of international cooperation.</p>
                    <p>3. To exploit the foregoing in the development of more accommodating
                        North-South relations, both political and economic, thereby reducing the
                        hostility toward the United States that in recent years had developed within
                        the Third World.</p>
                    <p>4. To push U.S.-Soviet Strategic Arms Limitation Talks into strategic arms
                        reduction talks, and to widen the scope of American-Soviet collaboration by
                        engaging the Soviet Union in a wider pattern of negotiating relationships,
                        thereby making detente both more comprehensive and reciprocal.</p>
                    <p>5. To normalize U.S.-Chinese relations in order to preserve the U.S.-Chinese
                        relationship as a major stabilizing factor in the global power balance.<note

                    </p>
                    <p>6. To seek a comprehensive Middle Eastern settlement, without which the
                        further radicalization of the Arab world and the reentry of the Soviet Union
                        into the Middle East would be difficult to avoid.</p>
                    <p>7. To set in motion a progressive and peaceful transformation of South Africa
                        and to forge closer cooperation with the moderate black African
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>8. To restrict the level of global armaments and to inhibit nuclear
                        proliferation through international agreements as well as unilateral U.S.
                        acts.</p>
                    <p>9. To enhance global sensitivity to human rights through pertinent U.S.
                        actions, comments, and example, thereby also seizing the ideological
                        initiative.</p>
                    <p>10. To renovate the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> defense
                        posture in keeping with the requirements posed by the Soviet arms
                        buildup.</p>
                    <p>The basic premise of the foregoing was that the United States should
                        undertake to play in the world as constructive a role as the one that it did
                        play shortly after World War II, but in a vastly changed context. The new
                        Administration felt that the U.S. should help in the shaping of a new
                        international system that cannot be confined to the developed countries but
                        must involve increasingly the entire international community of more than
                        150 nation-states. Unlike the years 1945–1950, this should call not for
                        American dictation but for more subtle inspiration and cooperative
                        leadership on a much wider front.</p>

                    <p>It is probably fair and not only self-serving to conclude that the first year
                        in foreign policy was a <hi rend="italic">relative success</hi>. Progress
                        has been made toward deeper and more structural improvements in regard to a
                        number of key regional, bilateral or global problems. The Administration has
                        not gone for quick successes or band-aids; on the contrary, it has
                        undertaken responses which are potentially of a more structural and enduring
                        kind. The real payoffs will come later but they are likely to last
                        longer.</p>
                    <p>Our accomplishments and our shortcomings can perhaps be best summarized in a
                        brief table:</p>
                    <p>Our pluses:</p>
                    <p>—U.S. again identified at home and abroad with moral values, generating some

                    <p>—More emphasis on the centrality of Alliance relations in U.S. foreign policy
                        and on the priority of North-South accommodation;</p>
                    <p>—Explicit U.S. support for European unity and progress on <gloss

                    <p>—Uncertainty about how we reconcile detente and Alliance security;</p>
                    <p>—Lack of adequate preparation of the Soviets for our new approach;</p>
                    <p>—Underestimation of domestic reaction to some aspects of our Middle Eastern
                        policy;</p>
                    <p>—Absence of concrete economic initiatives on the North-South front;</p>
                    <p>—Seeming disinterest in the Far East;</p>
                    <p>—Some loss of credibility in the energy and non-proliferation areas;</p>
                    <p>—Seeming softness in our policy regarding Soviet assertiveness;</p>
                    <p>—Except for the Notre Dame address, inadequate articulation of our broad
                        foreign policy assumptions and priorities.</p>
                    <p>With the above in mind, it is noteworthy to note the nature of the criticism
                        that has lately been directed at this Administration’s foreign policy.
                        Almost none of it entails any specific or concrete charge. The
                        Administration is neither condemned for any particular major failure (such
                        as the Bay of Pigs) nor for any particular misdeed (destabilization of
                        Chile, or the fruitless enterprise in Angola, or the ineptitude regarding
                        Cyprus). In contrast, it is criticized more generally for a lack of
                        cohesion, for absence of clearcut priorities, or for shortcomings on the
                        level of tactical execution.</p>
                    <p>Some of these charges may, in fact, be justified. It is probably true that in
                        the first year we undertook too much and thus could not deliver enough. At
                        the same time, what we undertook was in some respects a response to what we
                        inherited. Thus, in a sense, the generalized charge of lack of cohesion
                        involves in some measure an acknowledgment that there has been an absence of

                    <p>Our own self-criticism—in addition to the ones made earlier—would tend to be
                        of a different nature: we probably did overstate our determination to pursue
                        a different and more ambitious <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>

                        prepared to accept, and we may have thereby created the false impression in
                        Moscow that being tough with the <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> Administration in fact pays off. We may have at times
                        overstated the importance of the U.S.-Soviet relationship, thereby again
                        stimulating fears in Western Europe that the United States is preparing to
                        cut a deal with the Soviet Union not entirely in keeping with European
                        interests. We probably have not put enough emphasis on our relations with
                        China, and we have failed to exploit the Chinese end of the
                        U.S.-Soviet-Chinese triangle in order to advance our own interests. We did
                        occasionally act with insufficient consistency in regard to the Middle East,
                        and in retrospect the U.S.-Soviet statement was both too explicit and
                        implied more than was either intended or necessary.<note n="19"

                    <p>More generally, there is also the wider issue of the total impression created
                        by our foreign policy. In this connection, it might be useful to look at
                        alternative U.S. foreign policies in terms of four types, each based on
                        certain basic preferences and assumptions. I could call them, to emphasize
                        that they are part of a spectrum (with exaggerations at the edges), the
                        liberal/liberal model; the liberal; the conservative; and the
                        conservative/conservative. In a condensed fashion, the foregoing can be
                        represented as follows:<note n="20" xml:id="d62fn20">In the left-hand margin

                    <p>By and large, at the risk of some simplification, it can be said that the
                            conservative<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> position can be identified
                        with Senator <persName corresp="#p_GB_1">Goldwater</persName>; the
                        conservative position with Senator <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1"
                            >Jackson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry
                            Kissinger</persName>; the liberal policy position has been on the whole
                        characteristic of your Administration; the liberal<hi rend="superscript"
                            >2</hi> posture has been associated with McGovern.</p>
                    <p>However, lately on a number of issues the dividing line between your stand
                        and the liberal<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> position has become blurred,
                        and in some respects, your foreign policy has appeared to some people as
                        increasingly fitting the liberal<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> model. Some
                        have the impression that accommodation with the Soviet Union is your primary
                        objective; that we wish to settle regional problems by working primarily
                        with the Soviet Union, that we are not sensitive to Allied concerns; and
                        that we are harder on human rights only when they are violated by
                        conservative regimes.</p>
                    <p>Foreign policy to a large extent is a matter of nuance and tone. Given the
                        shifts in public opinion within the United States, I think it would be
                        useful for you to adopt occasionally a tone which would place you more
                        precisely within the liberal model and even at times leaning toward the
                        conservative model. Needless to say, my own judgment is that the liberal
                        model corresponds best to the nature of global change and provides the more
                        fruitful approach for a creative American role in the world. Our ability to
                        adopt that posture, however, will be greatly weakened politically if we are
                        seen as primarily following a <pb n="294" facs="0335" xml:id="pg_294"
                            />liberal<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> approach; we can even gain some
                        political support if, from time to time, we seem to be adopting a somewhat
                        tougher conservative posture, especially on such matters as the Soviet role
                        in the world, Cuban “neocolonialism”, or on human rights.</p>

                    <p>A recent review with the Vice President has yielded the following priorities

                    </p>
                    <p>—Progress in Middle East negotiations</p>
                    <p>—Ratification of Panama Canal Treaties</p>
                    <p>—<gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss>

                    </p>
                    <p>—Defense Decisions during Congressional review of the Budget (e.g., <gloss>

                        </gloss>) and a Presidential Address on Defense Issues</p>
                    <p>—International Economic and Trade Policy (including East-West Trade)</p>
                    <p>—Trip to Latin America, Africa</p>

                    <p>—Arms Sales</p>
                    <p>In addition to supporting you on these Presidential Priority Agenda items, my
                        staff will be bringing to your attention decisions on gray area systems
                        initiatives, intelligence charters, and Indian Ocean arms limits. There are
                        three other matters that are emergency or high priority issues requiring a
                        national strategy and your attention.</p>
                    <p>—International economic issues: in particular, a defense of the dollar, a
                        continued freeze on oil prices, coordinated stimulation of the world
                        economy, MTN agreement (this year), and commodity agreements. These issues
                        may come to have a very important and difficult political dimension in our
                        relations with West Germany and the oil producing countries.</p>
                    <p>—China. We need to find ways to maintain momentum on that aspect of our
                        relations where we have common concerns—global security issues deriving from
                        Soviet efforts to expand their influence. I will be suggesting that in the
                        spring, about the time of a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        agreement, I should visit Peking.<note n="21" xml:id="d62fn21">

                        China and at home. Subsequently, I believe the Vice President should visit
                        China later this year after the Congressional elections.<note n="22"
                            xml:id="d62fn22">
                            <persName corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName> did not visit China

                        visits, until concrete progress on normalization opens up.</p>
                    <p>—Soviet Union. We have invested a great deal of effort in the expansion of
                        the U.S.-Soviet negotiating relationships. Some of these have been moving
                        forward in a promising fashion. There is thus some real hope for a more
                        stable and more generally reciprocal U.S.-Soviet relationship. At the same
                        time, either by design or simply as a response to an apparent opportunity,
                        the Soviets have stepped up their efforts to exploit African turbulence to
                        their own advantage. The Soviet/Cuban military presence in Ethiopia is
                        particularly dangerous and could then produce a reaction in this country
                        which could jeopardize not only <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> but
                        the wider fabric of the emerging U.S.-Soviet relationship. Accordingly, at
                        some early opportunity, you should communicate your concerns to Brezhnev,
                        emphasizing to him that there is no such thing as a selective or
                        compartmentalized detente.</p>

                        Government opens up the prospect of real progress on Cyprus and the

                            <persName corresp="#p_EB_1">Ecevit</persName> served as Prime Minister
                            of Turkey from June to July 1977, whereupon he was succeeded by Demirel.
                            Following a no-confidence vote in the National Assembly in late December
                            1977, Demirel resigned, and Koruturk appointed <persName

                            developments is printed in <ref target="frus1977-80v21">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations,</hi> 1977–1980, vol. XXI,

                        reasons related to Panama, we don’t want to move too quickly. We need a
                        quiet planning session with the Turks to map a coordinated strategy with
                        respect to progress on Cyprus and associated progress on the Turkish <gloss

                    <p>Bearing in mind last year’s experience, as well as our overall appraisal, it
                        might also be noteworthy in this connection to note the following. We
                        confront a danger of an alliance developing for the purpose of stalemating
                        our foreign policy as a whole. The linkage of such issues as Panama, <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and the Middle East, not to mention
                        priority issues of the second order, or a crisis in Ethiopia, could generate
                        a coalition which might effectively make the case for a “tougher” foreign
                        policy. Different constituencies would emphasize different aspects but the
                        total effect could be one of stalemate. Accordingly, you should:</p>
                    <p>—Somewhat toughen your rhetoric on foreign policy issues, emphasizing more
                        the theme of national security and human rights.</p>
                    <p>—Stand firm in the negotiating process in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> by insisting on Soviet concessions regarding <gloss

                            <pb n="296" facs="0337" xml:id="pg_296"/>Also, adopt a delaying posture
                        regarding China, <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> and <gloss

                    <p>—Concentrate on Panama, and on other steps toward peace in the Middle East,
                        so that ratification of the Panama Treaties and peace progress in the Middle

                    <p>Our country, within sight and memory of some Americans still living, has been
                        transformed from a largely agrarian society to the world’s greatest
                        industrial power—one in which economic, political, and social mobility are
                        the accepted order of the day. The fantastic stories of Horatio Alger, as
                        well as those of H.G. Wells, have come true. Of course, there is still
                        poverty in America. There is still lack of sufficient opportunity for many.
                        There is still discrimination.</p>
                    <p>But, day by day, and despite a few deplorable detours, we have held
                        remarkably to the journey begun by our Founding Fathers—toward a new nation
                        in a new world in which each citizen might stand free and equal beside his
                        neighbor, able to make the most of his or her human potential.</p>
                    <p>When I am asked about the American people—as I often am by leaders of other
                        countries—I say that as a people we have today a renewed faith in our old
                        dreams, and this is something President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> and I believe in very deeply. Because of who and what
                        we are, both the basic interests and the ideals of our people must be
                        present in our foreign policy, or it will not be long sustained.</p>
                    <p>• We must maintain a defense establishment modern and strong enough to
                        protect ourselves and our allies.</p>
                    <pb n="297" facs="0338" xml:id="pg_297"/>
                    <p>• We must protect American investment overseas and insure continuing access
                        to vital raw materials.</p>
                    <p>• We must be strongly competitive economically so that American families can
                        continue to enjoy their standard of living.</p>
                    <p>• We must maintain our close relations with our allies, while we seek at the
                        same time improved contacts with our main competitor, the Soviet Union, and
                        with the nonaligned nations.</p>
                    <p>All of this, and more, can be pursued—as we pursue our national
                        interest—while still expressing the deeper ideals and aspirations that have
                        led us to our remarkable economic and social progress here at home.</p>
                    <p>Our strength lies not only in our ideals but in the practical way we identify
                        problems and work systematically toward their solution. We do the best when
                        we are true to ourselves.</p>
                    <p>That is why America was at her best in the Marshall plan, why we have felt at
                        home with Food for Peace and the Peace Corps. That is why I find such broad
                        public support for President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                        >Carter</persName>’s emphasis upon human rights—including not only rights to
                        the integrity of the person and political rights but the rights to food,
                        clothing, shelter, housing, health, and education.</p>
                    <p>That is why, with all its difficulties, we have embarked on a course of
                        diplomacy in the Middle East which may help bring peace to the people of
                        that region.</p>
                    <p>That is why we are trying to help bring solutions—not our solutions but
                        solutions through free elections—in Rhodesia and in Nambia so that people
                        there will have their chance for human emancipation and development.</p>
                    <p>That is why we seek arms control arrangements through negotiations and have
                        adopted a conscious policy of restraint on conventional arms transfers.</p>
                    <p>That is why we took tangible first steps in 1977 toward other goals, as well:
                        to stop further nuclear proliferation; to reach agreements on the control of
                        strategic weapons, agreements that will enhance the security of our nation
                        and all the world; to reach agreement with our Western industrial partners
                        on policies leading to economic revival and growth; to reaffirm our
                        commitment to normalization of relations with the People’s Republic of
                        China; to reduce military competition in the Indian Ocean; to emphasize our
                        support for racial equality and full political participation of all the
                        people of South Africa.</p>
                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> Administration in 1977
                        made a conscious and deliberate effort to construct a foreign policy based
                        upon American interests and upon American values and ideals.</p>
                    <pb n="298" facs="0339" xml:id="pg_298"/>
                    <p>In 1978, there are actions, decisions, and choices which we must make here in
                        America—some of them difficult—which will help determine how such a policy
                        can be nourished and further evolve.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Panama Canal Treaties</p>
                    <p>One involves the decision of the U.S. Senate on the Panama Canal
                        treaties—treaties which are the culmination of 14 years’ work by four
                        American Presidents of both major political parties and their Secretaries of
                        State. This is a decision which is being watched not only by all the nations
                        of Latin America—all of which favor the treaties—but by other nations around
                        the world.</p>
                    <p>Through these treaties, we can secure—definitively and permanently—our right
                        to use the canal and to protect it. It is a place for us to put the lie,
                        once and for all, to the wornout charge that we Americans are interested
                        only in making the Southern Hemisphere safe for our own economic
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>Imagine, if you will, that a foreign country controlled and administered a
                        10-mile-wide strip of land running the length of the Mississippi River. How
                        long do you think the people of this country would willingly accept such a
                        situation? This is an issue requiring understanding and foresight.</p>
                    <p>If we ratify the treaties, we can make clear to the world that disputes can
                        and should be settled peaceably—through the rule of law and negotiation.
                        And, most importantly, we can insure and safeguard the long-term usefulness
                        and viability of the canal itself to all who use it, including
                        ourselves.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic Relations</p>
                    <p>Another decision we must make is one regarding our economic relations with
                        the rest of the world.</p>
                    <p>In 1978 we shall be moving toward a conclusion of the Tokyo Round of trade
                        negotiations with other importing and exporting countries.</p>
                    <p>In 1962, when President <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>
                        argued for the passage of the historic Trade Expansion Act, which led to 10
                        years of worldwide economic expansion, he rightly pointed out that “a rising
                        tide lifts all boats.”<note n="2" xml:id="d63fn2">

                    <p>Today the world is badly in need of economic recovery. Other major nations
                        are suffering rates of inflation and unemployment which rival or are even
                        higher than ours. The Tokyo Round, of and by itself, will not instantly
                        restore worldwide economic prosperity. It will, how<pb n="299" facs="0340"

                        If it fails and falls victim to a new wave of international protectionism,
                        we can be sure that many of the “boats” will founder and some may sink.</p>
                    <p>I know that this is not an abstract, theoretical matter for the American
                        worker or businessman or farmer who depends for his family’s living on

                        television sets, microwave ovens, textiles, footwear, automobiles,
                        computers, sugar, and many other items. The changing world economy has made
                        other nations competitive in production of these products, and we are
                        feeling the result of it.</p>
                    <p>The <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> Administration knows this
                        and is doing its best to help the American industries and people affected.
                        The new steel program, announced in December,<note n="3" xml:id="d63fn3">On
                            December 6, 1977, the <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>

                            In addition to loan guarantees, tax breaks, and economic assistance to
                            communities impacted by steel layoffs, the plan also featured a
                            “trigger” or reference price system designed to eliminate the
                            importation of lower-priced steel into the United States. <persName

                            production of the most efficient steel producers, would “trigger” a
                            government investigation if countries exported steel to the United

                    <p>But we and others must help ourselves in ways that do not throw the world
                        back into the kind of disastrous protectionist spiral that we all
                        experienced in the Great Depression.</p>
                    <p>Under economic pressure, one country, and then another, in the 1930’s closed
                        its borders to foreign goods. High tariffs increased the price of everything
                        to everyone, everywhere. Then we closed our banks and our businesses and our
                        farms as we fell into worldwide depression. The great ports of our country
                        were, as you well know, empty and forlorn places.</p>
                    <p>A new wave of protectionism would imperil the American profits and 10 million
                        jobs which depend on those exports. The hardest hit of all would be the
                        American farmer, who is having a hard time staying in the black right now.
                        California is an agricultural state.</p>
                    <p>I have just learned that there is more acreage under cultivation in the
                        United States to produce food which we sell to Japan than there is total
                        acreage under cultivation in Japan. If Japan, for instance, were to close
                        its borders to our food and fiber as part of a trade war, farms and <pb
                            n="300" facs="0341" xml:id="pg_300"/>rural communities in this State and
                        elsewhere in America would be severely harmed.</p>
                    <p>So we must make the necessary decision to keep our commitment to both
                        domestic and world economies which are open to competition and which reward
                        productivity. That will involve knocking down barriers to our products
                        elsewhere in the world. But it will also involve our acceptance of the fact
                        that to buy from us, other countries must be able to sell to us.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Third World</p>
                    <p>We also have decisions to make—beyond those surrounding the Panama Canal
                        treaties and the Tokyo Round—about a whole range of relations with the
                        so-called Third World. These countries, most of them gaining their
                        independence after World War II, are increasingly involved in our daily
                        lives.</p>
                    <p>You know how the amount and cost of oil from these countries affect this
                        country.</p>
                    <p>We also get more than 50% of the tin, aluminum, and manganese we need from
                        less developed countries and substantial amounts of our lead, tungsten, and
                        copper.</p>
                    <p>In addition, we depend on the emerging countries for an important share of
                        our exports. Recent figures show, for instance, we exported $29 billion in
                        goods to the non-oil-producing developing countries. This was three times
                        the 1970 figure, three times our exports to Japan, and $3 billion more than
                        our exports to all of industrialized Europe. These exports, of course, mean
                        American jobs.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, it is in the developing world that many of the so-called
                        global problems are most evident and threatening.</p>
                    <p>Inefficient and wasteful use of the Earth’s resources, pollution of the
                        oceans and atmosphere, nuclear proliferation, unchecked arms
                        competitions—all of these are problems which involve not only these
                        countries but also the safety of the human race.</p>
                    <p>Most countries of the Third World have too little food; many lack the means
                        to produce enough of their own. Almost all have exploding populations.</p>
                    <p>Even the most optimistic projections for the future point to population
                        increases in the Third World of some 75% by the year 2000. Perhaps even more
                        troubling, this growth seems certain to be concentrated in already
                        hard-pressed urban centers. Imagine, if you will, as the projections
                        indicate, a Mexico City with 32 million people; Sao Paulo with 26 million;
                        and Calcutta, Bombay, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul, Peking, and Shanghai each with
                        some 19 million in 22 years.</p>
                    <p>In the years immediately ahead, many of the key nations of the Third World
                        will be even more a part of our daily dialogue than they are today. We must
                        decide how we shall relate to them.</p>
                    <pb n="301" facs="0342" xml:id="pg_301"/>
                    <p>These countries believe that they should no longer be the “hewers of wood and
                        drawers of water” for the rich Western nations, and we understand this. In
                        the past year, we have reduced their suspicion of the United States and,
                        thereby, lessened the likelihood that we could be faced with attempts at new
                        cartels, built around raw materials and commodities other than oil, and
                        unending political and economic hostility.</p>
                    <p>The countries of the Third World now feel that we regard them as important
                        and sovereign nations and that we identify with their human aspirations. The
                        emerging nations of the world can be constructive partners of the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>Make no mistake about it. These countries are not early-day miniatures of the
                        United States. Many will choose paths of political and economic development
                        which we will not approve. But a majority, at least, will be looking to us
                        for understanding and assistance as they seek to build modern societies.</p>
                    <p>Will we be willing to share our technology with these countries? Will we be
                        ready to help stabilize the basic commodity prices on which many of their
                        economies are based? Will we treat their products fairly in the
                        international marketplace? Will we be willing to support their national
                        economic development plans when they do not always suit our own tastes? All
                        these questions are complex and some pose difficult problems. But this
                        Administration fully realizes that we shall harm our own interests and we
                        shall not be true to our own values if we fail to address these issues
                        sympathetically.</p>

                    <p>An immediate and tangible test of our intentions toward the Third World lies
                        in southern Africa. I speak of the three principal problems of Rhodesia,
                        Namibia, and the situation within South Africa itself. We cannot impose
                        solutions in southern Africa. We cannot dictate terms to any of the parties;
                        our leverage is limited.</p>

                        and black Africans frankly and yet with a measure of trust. We would lose
                        our ability to be helpful if we lost that trust. It is, therefore, essential
                        that our policies of encouraging justice for people of all races in southern
                        Africa be clear to all.</p>
                    <p>After careful consideration, this Administration is actively pursuing
                        solutions to all three southern African problems. These problems must be
                        addressed together, for they are intertwined.</p>
                    <p>Some have argued that apartheid in South Africa should be ignored for the
                        time being in order to concentrate on achieving progress on Rhodesia and
                        Namibia. Such a policy would be wrong and would not work. It would be blind
                        to the reality that the beginning of progress <pb n="302" facs="0343"
                            xml:id="pg_302"/>must be made soon within South Africa if there is to be
                        a possibility of peaceful solutions in the longer run. It could mislead the
                        South Africans about our real concerns. It would prejudice our relations
                        with our African friends. It would do a disservice to our own beliefs. And
                        it would discourage those of all races who are working for peaceful progress
                        within South Africa.</p>
                    <p>We believe that we can effectively influence South Africa on Rhodesia and
                        Namibia while expressing our concerns about apartheid.</p>
                    <p>We believe that whites as well as blacks must have a future in Namibia,
                        Zimbabwe, and South Africa. We also believe that their security lies in
                        progress. Intransigence will only lead to greater insecurity.</p>
                    <p>We will welcome and recognize positive action by South Africa on each of
                        these three issues. But the need is real for progress on all of them, and we
                        shall need the continued support of the American people for a policy which
                        can encourage and press for that progress.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Arms Limitation</p>
                    <p>Another decision facing us, as a people, is one which is now reflected in our
                        discussions on strategic arms limitation with the Soviet Union. Security is
                        the issue here. We pursue our security in two ways:</p>
                    <p>• By maintaining a military establishment which will see to the safety of
                        ourselves and our allies and</p>
                    <p>• By arms control.</p>
                    <p>What we cannot achieve by mutual, equal limitations, we insure by our own
                        strength.</p>
                    <p>Thus, we have to think of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (<gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>) as a process. It is a process of
                        discovering whether we can work out some of our security problems with the
                        Soviet Union. It is a process also in the sense that we try to solve what
                        strategic problems we can at each stage; then, we move on to the next stage
                        and the next level of problems.</p>
                    <p>We do not seek reductions in arms for their own sake but only when reductions
                        promote security. But there can be an important result from arms reductions
                        alongside an increase in our security: the potential for us and for others,
                        including those in the developing world, to cut spending on armaments and to
                        reorder priorities.</p>
                    <p>If we have the courage and patience to see it through, I believe we can both
                        lower the threshold of international danger and release new resources for
                        the works of peace through <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and other
                        such negotiations. But we must summon the will to do it. For it is in our
                        relations with the Soviet Union that war and peace issues and decisions are
                        most involved.</p>
                    <p>Our policies toward the Soviet Union are based upon a realistic appreciation
                        that this is a serious competitive relationship and that Soviet <pb n="303"
                            facs="0344" xml:id="pg_303"/>objectives in the world are very different
                        from ours. It is also important to recognize, however, that there are
                        specific matters on which our interests are not in conflict—not least, in
                        the avoidance of nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>In the cause of peace and of our own interest, we have engaged the Soviet
                        Union on a wide range of concrete matters intended in the first instance to
                        stabilize the military competition and to regulate the political
                        competition. These are our first objectives, because they go to the heart of
                        the issue of war and peace.</p>
                    <p>Beyond these objectives, we seek to enlarge areas of common understanding and
                        common action on a range of international issues, including human rights;
                        cooperation on matters affecting the lives of people everywhere, such as
                        disease, food supply, pollution of the environment, and the application of
                        science and technology.</p>
                    <p>Progress in these fields is uneven and may take a long time, but we draw
                        patience and a long-term perspective from our realization of how far we have
                        come from the intense and dangerous cold war spirit that prevailed only a
                        few decades ago.</p>
                    <p>The alternative to this active dialogue with the Soviets implies a return to
                        the tensions and mutual isolation of the cold war. Many of you and the
                        leadership of this Administration remember what that period was like. In
                        good conscience, we cannot recommend that we lead the country back to the
                        troubles and fear of that era.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>• First, true peace must be based on normal relations among the parties to
                        the peace. Peace means more than just an end to belligerency.</p>
                    <p>• Second, there must be withdrawal by Israel from territories occupied in
                        1967 and agreement on secure and recognized borders for all parties in the
                        context of normal and peaceful relations in accordance with U.N. Resolutions
                        242 and 338.</p>
                    <p>• Third, there must be a resolution of the Palestinian problem in all its
                        aspects; it must recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people
                        and enable the Palestinians to participate in the determination of their own
                        future.</p>
                    <p>I believe that these principles, as stated by the President, should be
                        acceptable to the governments and peoples on both sides of the Arab-Israeli
                        conflict.</p>
                    <p>To move from principles to concrete achievement will require flexibility and
                        courage, qualities of statesmanship of which the leaders of Egypt and Israel
                        have already given full display.</p>
                    <p>For our part, we stand ready to help Arabs and Israelis achieve their peace.
                        It is important to our national interests that we do so; our values and
                        character as a people demand no less than our greatest effort to help
                        resolve this tragic conflict.</p>
                    <p>We will participate actively in the work of the Jerusalem meeting, as the
                        parties have asked us to do. When difficulties in the negotiations arise, we
                        may be able to make some helpful suggestions to bridge the gaps between the
                        parties; however, we will not impose a blueprint for <pb n="305" facs="0346"
                            xml:id="pg_305"/>resolution of issues which ultimately only the peoples
                        of the area can resolve.</p>
                    <p>There can be no turning back from Jerusalem. Arab and Israeli peoples would
                        bitterly resent a diplomatic failure now that these long-hostile nations
                        have found the will and the capacity to approach each other in mutual
                        respect.</p>
                    <p>From what I have said today, I believe that you can tell that I am basically
                        optimistic about our foreign policy and the chances for future advances in
                        the cause of peace.</p>
                    <p>Despite our problems, this is a strong and free country and one which is
                        filled with hope and vitality.</p>
                    <p>Some 33 years into the nuclear age, the world has not blown itself up.
                        Indeed, we have in those years, through diplomacy and international
                        leadership, lessened the chances of that ever happening.</p>
                    <p>We have, since World War II, seen more than 100 new countries enter
                        nationhood. They are becoming productive, self-sustaining members of the
                        international community.</p>
                    <p>The task ahead, as I see it, will be to persevere on the course we have
                        charted. This is a time when political and economic change is taking place
                        so rapidly—Peter Drucker has aptly called this “an age of
                        discontinuity”—that it might tempt some to retreat to our old, inward
                        fortress America habitudes.<note n="8" xml:id="d63fn8">Drucker, a Claremont

                            to the separation.”</note> In the past year, President <persName

                        man’s perfectability.</p>
                    <p>We have great strength. Properly channeled, our strength can be a catalytic
                        and vital force in bringing peace, opportunity, and material well-being to

                    <head>64. Editorial Note</head>
                    <p>On January 19, 1978, at 9 p.m., President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Jimmy
                            Carter</persName> delivered his State of the Union address before both
                        Houses of Congress. His remarks were broadcast live on radio and television.
                        After an introduction by Speaker of the House of Representatives <persName
                            corresp="#p_OTP_1">Thomas “Tip” O’Neill</persName>, the President
                        devoted the first portion of his address to domestic items, including the
                        establishment of a Department of Education and civil service reform, before
                        emphasizing the main themes of his administration’s foreign policy:</p>
                    <p>“In our foreign policy, the separation of people from government has been in
                        the past a source of weakness and error. In a democratic system like ours,
                        foreign policy decisions must be able to stand the test of public
                        examination and public debate. If we make a mistake in this administration,
                        it will be on the side of frankness and openness with the American
                        people.</p>
                    <p>“In our modern world, when the deaths of literally millions of people can
                        result from a few terrifying seconds of destruction, the path of national
                        strength and security is identical to the path of peace.</p>
                    <p>“Tonight, I am happy to report that because we are strong, our Nation is at
                        peace with the world.</p>
                    <p>“We are a confident nation. We’ve restored a moral basis for our foreign
                        policy. The very heart of our identity as a nation is our firm commitment to
                        human rights.</p>
                    <p>“We stand for human rights because we believe that government has as a
                        purpose to promote the well-being of its citizens. This is true in our
                        domestic policy; it’s also true in our foreign policy. The world must know
                        that in support of human rights, the United States will stand firm.</p>
                    <p>“We expect no quick or easy results, but there has been significant movement
                        toward greater freedom and humanity in several parts of the world.</p>
                    <p>“Thousands of political prisoners have been freed. The leaders of the
                        world—even our ideological adversaries—now see that their attitude toward
                        fundamental human rights affects their standing in the international
                        community, and it affects their relations with the United States.</p>
                    <p>“To serve the interests of every American, our foreign policy has three major
                        goals.</p>
                    <p>“The first and prime concern is and will remain the security of our
                        country.</p>
                    <p>“Security is based on our national will, and security is based on the
                        strength of our Armed Forces. We have the will, and militarily we are very
                        strong.</p>
                    <pb n="307" facs="0348" xml:id="pg_307"/>
                    <p>“Security also comes through the strength of our alliances. We have
                        reconfirmed our commitment to the defense of Europe, and this year we will
                        demonstrate that commitment by further modernizing and strengthening our
                        military capabilities there.</p>
                    <p>“Security can also be enhanced by agreements with potential adversaries which
                        reduce the threat of nuclear disaster while maintaining our own relative
                        strategic capability.</p>
                    <p>“In areas of peaceful competition with the Soviet Union, we will continue to
                        more than hold our own.</p>
                    <p>“At the same time, we are negotiating with quiet confidence, without haste,
                        with careful determination, to ease the tensions between us and to ensure
                        greater stability and security.</p>
                    <p>“The strategic arms limitation talks have been long and difficult. We want a
                        mutual limit on both the quality and the quantity of the giant nuclear
                        arsenals of both nations, and then we want actual reductions in strategic
                        arms as a major step toward the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons from
                        the face of the Earth.</p>
                    <p>“If these talks result in an agreement this year—and I trust they will—I
                        pledge to you that the agreement will maintain and enhance the stability of
                        the world’s strategic balance and the security of the United States.</p>
                    <p>“For 30 years, concerted but unsuccessful efforts have been made to ban the
                        testing of atomic explosives—both military weapons and peaceful nuclear
                        devices.</p>
                    <p>“We are hard at work with Great Britain and the Soviet Union on an agreement
                        which will stop testing and will protect our national security and provide
                        for adequate verification of compliance. We are now making, I believe, good
                        progress toward this comprehensive ban on nuclear explosions.</p>
                    <p>“We are also working vigorously to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons
                        among the nations of the world which do not now have them and to reduce the
                        deadly global traffic in conventional arms sales. Our stand for peace is
                        suspect if we are also the principal arms merchant of the world. So, we’ve
                        decided to cut down our arms transfers abroad on a year-by-year basis and to
                        work with other major arms exporters to encourage their similar
                        constraint.</p>
                    <p>“Every American has a stake in our second major goal—a world at peace. In a
                        nuclear age, each of us is threatened when peace is not secured everywhere.
                        We are trying to promote harmony in those parts of the world where major
                        differences exist among other nations and threaten international peace.</p>
                    <p>“In the Middle East, we are contributing our good offices to maintain the
                        momentum of the current negotiations and to keep open the <pb n="308"
                            facs="0349" xml:id="pg_308"/>lines of communication among the Middle
                        Eastern leaders. The whole world has a great stake in the success of these
                        efforts. This is a precious opportunity for a historic settlement of a
                        longstanding conflict—an opportunity which may never come again in our
                        lifetime.</p>
                    <p>“Our role has been difficult and sometimes thankless and controversial. But
                        it has been constructive and it has been necessary, and it will
                        continue.</p>
                    <p>“Our third major foreign policy goal is one that touches the life of every
                        American citizen every day—world economic growth and stability.</p>
                    <p>“This requires strong economic performance by the industrialized democracies
                        like ourselves and progress in resolving the global energy crisis. Last
                        fall, with the help of others, we succeeded in our vigorous efforts to
                        maintain the stability of the price of oil. But as many foreign leaders have
                        emphasized to me personally and, I am sure, to you, the greatest future
                        contribution that America can make to the world economy would be an
                        effective energy conservation program here at home. We will not hesitate to
                        take the actions needed to protect the integrity of the American dollar.</p>
                    <p>“We are trying to develop a more just international system. And in this
                        spirit, we are supporting the struggle for human development in Africa, in
                        Asia, and in Latin America.</p>
                    <p>“Finally, the world is watching to see how we act on one of our most
                        important and controversial items of business—approval of the Panama Canal
                        treaties. The treaties now before the Senate are the result of the work of
                        four administrations—two Democratic, two Republican.</p>
                    <p>“They guarantee that the canal will be open always for unrestricted use by
                        the ships of the world. Our ships have the right to go to the head of the
                        line for priority of passage in times of emergency or need. We retain the
                        permanent right to defend the canal with our own military forces, if
                        necessary, to guarantee its openness and its neutrality.</p>
                    <p>“The treaties are to the clear advantage of ourselves, the Panamanians, and
                        the other users of the canal. Ratifying the Panama Canal treaties will
                        demonstrate our good faith to the world, discourage the spread of hostile
                        ideologies in this hemisphere, and directly contribute to the economic
                        well-being and the security of the United States.”</p>
                    <p>The President then acknowledged the applause from the audience before
                        referencing two moments that had taken place during his recent trip to the
                        Middle East, South Asia, and Europe that also “confirmed the final aims” of
                        U.S. foreign policy:</p>
                    <p>“One was in a little village in India, where I met a people as passionately
                        attached to their rights and liberties as we are, but whose chil<pb n="309"
                            facs="0350" xml:id="pg_309"/>dren have a far smaller chance for good
                        health or food or education or human fulfillment than a child born in this
                        country.</p>
                    <p>“The other moment was in Warsaw, capital of a nation twice devastated by war
                        in this century. There, people have rebuilt the city which war’s destruction
                        took from them. But what was new only emphasized clearly what was lost.</p>
                    <p>“What I saw in those two places crystallized for me the purposes of our own
                        Nation’s policy: to ensure economic justice, to advance human rights, to
                        resolve conflicts without violence, and to proclaim in our great democracy
                        our constant faith in the liberty and dignity of human beings everywhere.”

                    <p>I will be working closely with the Congress in 1978 to enact a program
                        addressed to the immediate and the long-term needs of our economy. I am
                        proposing tax reductions and reforms to continue our strong economic
                        recovery, to encourage increased investment by American businesses, and to
                        create a simpler and fairer tax system. I am seeking legislation to address
                        the special problems of the disadvantaged and the unemployed. And I am
                        taking new steps to combat inflation.</p>

                    <p rend="center">INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICIES THAT PROMOTE ECONOMIC RECOVERY
                        THROUGHOUT THE WORLD</p>
                    <p>Outside the United States, the world economy has seen a hesitant recovery
                        from the deep recession of 1974–75. The rapid pace of economic growth that
                        was widespread over most of the postwar years has all but disappeared.
                        Unemployment is high, and in most industrial countries except the United
                        States it is rising. Inflation is at high levels and declining only very
                        slowly.</p>
                    <p>The imbalances in the international economic system continue to strain the
                        world economy. Because of the surpluses of oil-exporting countries, many
                        countries have sizable deficits, including the United States. Some
                        industrial nations are also running large and persistent surpluses—thus
                        increasing the pressures on countries in deficit. These imbalances have been
                        a major factor contributing to disorder in exchange markets in recent
                        months.</p>
                    <p>The condition of the world economy requires above all that nations work
                        together to develop mutually beneficial solutions to global problems. If we
                        fail to work together, we will lose the gains in living standards arising
                        from the expansion of world commerce over the past three decades. If the
                        world economy becomes a collection of isolated and weak nations, we will all
                        lose.</p>
                    <p>The first priority in our international economic policy is continued economic
                        recovery throughout the industrial world. Growth of the U.S. economy—the
                        largest and strongest in the world—is of vital importance. The economic
                        program that I have proposed will ensure that America remains a leader and a
                        source of strength in the world economy. It is important that other strong
                        nations join with us to take direct actions to spur demand within their own
                        economies. World recovery cannot proceed if nations rely upon exports as the
                        principal source of economic expansion.</p>
                    <p>At the same time all countries must continue the battle against inflation.
                        This will require prudent fiscal and monetary policies. Such policies must
                        be supplemented by steps to reduce structural unemployment, measures to
                        avoid bottlenecks by encouraging investment, and cooperation in the
                        accumulation of commodity reserves to insulate the world from unforeseen
                        shocks.</p>
                    <p>Reducing the widespread imbalances in international payments will require
                        several parallel steps. To begin with, each individual country must ensure
                        that its own policies help relieve the strains. The United States will do
                        its part. In 1977 we had a current account deficit of about $18 billion.

                        correcting this deficit by moving quickly to enact the National Energy

                    <p>Countries in surplus should also do their part. Balance of payments surpluses
                        in some countries have contributed to the economic stagnation among their
                        trading partners. Where their own economies have slack, it is appropriate
                        for nations in surplus to stimulate the growth of domestic demand—thereby
                        increasing their imports and improving the prospects for growth in deficit
                        countries. In some countries, lifting restraints on imports from abroad and
                        reducing excessive government efforts to promote exports would be useful.
                        After consultations with the United States, the Japanese have indicated they
                        will take a series of steps toward reducing their large surplus.<note n="3"

                    <p>The system of flexible exchange rates for currencies also can be helpful in
                        correcting unsustainable imbalances in payments among countries. Since its
                        inception in 1973, this system has operated well under unprecedented
                        strains.</p>
                    <p>During 1977 the U.S. dollar has fallen in value against several key
                        currencies. The decline in the dollar’s value has occurred primarily against
                        the currencies of those nations that have large trade and payments
                        surpluses, and was not surprising in view of our large payments deficit and
                        their surpluses. Late in 1977, however, movements in our exchange rate
                        became both disorderly and excessively rapid. The United States reaffirmed
                        its intention to step in when conditions in exchange markets become
                        disorderly and to work in close cooperation with our friends abroad in this
                        effort.</p>
                    <p>Under the flexible exchange rate system basic economic forces must continue
                        to be the fundamental determinant of the value of currencies. However, we
                        will not permit speculative activities in currency markets to disrupt our
                        economy or those of our trading partners. We recognize fully our obligation
                        in this regard, and we have taken steps to fulfill it.</p>
                    <p>Although substantial progress can be made toward a balanced world economy,
                        some imbalances will persist for a substantial period of time. Financing
                        requirements will remain large while adjustments occur. The private markets
                        can and will continue to channel the bulk of the financing from surplus to
                        deficit countries. But it is essential that adequate official financing also
                        be available, in case of need, to encourage countries with severe payments
                        problems to adopt orderly and responsible corrective measures. To meet this
                        critical need the United States has strongly supported a proposal to
                        strengthen the In<pb n="312" facs="0353" xml:id="pg_312"/>ternational
                        Monetary Fund by the establishment of a new Supplementary Financing
                            Facility.<note n="4" xml:id="d65fn4">See <ref target="#d54fn4">footnote

                    <p>The United States also will continue to contribute resources to promote
                        growth in the economies of the developing nations. International assistance
                        efforts—through bilateral aid and multilateral institutions—must continue to
                        expand. We must also keep our doors open to imports from developing
                        countries, so that their economies can grow and prosper through expanded
                        trade.</p>
                    <p>A keystone of our international economic policy is to work with our trading
                        partners to protect a free and open trading system. The American economy
                        benefits by exporting those products that we make efficiently, and by
                        importing those that we produce least efficiently. An open trading system
                        increases our real incomes, strengthens competition in our markets, and
                        contributes to combating inflation.</p>
                    <p>The United States will firmly resist the demands for protection that
                        inevitably develop when the world economy suffers from high unemployment.
                        The ensuing decline in world trade would worsen our problem of inflation,
                        create inefficiencies in American enterprise, and lead to fewer jobs for
                        American workers. But international competition must be fair. We have
                        already taken and we will, when necessary, continue to take steps to ensure
                        that our businesses and workers do not suffer from unfair trade
                        practices.</p>
                    <p>I place great importance on the Multilateral Trade Negotiations now under way
                        in Geneva. I believe our negotiators will bring home agreements that are
                        fair and balanced and that will benefit our economy immensely over the years
                        to come. The importance of these discussions can hardly be overemphasized.
                        The trading system that emerges from the negotiations will set the tone for
                        international commerce well into the 1980s. Our commitment to a successful
                        conclusion to these talks underscores our long-term emphasis on the
                        retention and expansion of open and fair trade among nations.</p>

                    <p>There was some talk of the shift of emphasis to Western Europe and “security”
                        that occurred in 1973, talk in answer to your question about the
                        “priorities” of the previous administration. The fundamental reason for that
                        shift, however, was not underscored, not even mentioned. <persName

                        his script. He called the West Europeans “jackals” and “hyenas” when they
                        did not dance to his tune during the Middle East War. The Europeans simply
                        had taken him at his word: he asserted that he and the Soviets had
                        established a special relationship to make the world safe. A little war in
                        the Middle East was surely manageable by the superpowers. <gloss

                        trade nor credits had basically altered the competitive character of the
                        East-West relationship. The OPEC embargo forced Henry to consider the
                        North-South axis however much he had previously tried to ignore it. The
                        Vietnam “end game” was additional evidence, for those who cared to
                        understand, that his East-West scheme was based on dubious assumptions.</p>
                    <p>I repeat this, although you know it well, because it refutes those who argue,

                        Henry’s failure, not his outline of a new direction. His efforts failed: (a)
                        to stabilize the strategic balance; (b) to moderate Soviet competitive
                        behavior in the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia; (c) to produce
                        significant U.S.-Soviet economic interaction; (d) to address the North-South
                        economic and political issues. At the same time, his East-West policy
                        exacerbated tensions in our own alliance system while facilitating Soviet
                        management of the Warsaw Pact.</p>

                        taken from two sources: “Two Tactics of Social Democracy”<note n="4"

                            n="5" xml:id="d66fn5">Credited to Soviet economist Yevgeni
                            Preobrazhenski, who employed the law in his writings during the
                            1920s.</note> In 1905 and in the mid 1920s, the question was the same:
                        could a weak “working class” (or socialist sector) politically lead
                        (economically exploit) the stronger peasant (capitalist) class? The Leninist
                        answer was yes, with correct party leadership. Soviet policy toward the West
                        in the 1970s is designed for a similar correlation of political and economic
                        forces, but <pb n="315" facs="0356" xml:id="pg_315"/>now on a global scale.
                        Correct political leadership plus a firm grasp of the “military question,”
                        these were the essential prerequisites for 1905 and the Five Year Plans, and
                        they remain so for Soviet policy today. Soviet consciousness of these
                        historical analogies was vividly demonstrated in 1975, the 70th anniversary
                        of the writing of “Two Tactics,” when the theme was played throughout the
                        year in the Soviet press. By 1974, however, it was already clear that “law

                        from the West, was not as active as expected. The U.S. would not be as
                        easily “collectivized” as the peasantry. The collapse in South Vietnam and
                        the swing of U.S. military attention back to Europe altered the “military
                        question.” The Middle East, of course, was also a strategic setback. The
                        only thing left of detente was <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, and
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>’s importance for Moscow was
                        everything but arms control. It had become the single factor that might
                        prevent the alteration of the East-West relationship by the changing
                        North-South and East-West relationships. The Soviet slogan was and remains,
                        “the most important thing today is to prevent nuclear war” (omitting to
                        observe, of course, that it is the “least likely” kind of war today). And it
                        means, “If the U.S. doesn’t give us priority attention over West-West and
                        North-South, we have the military might to regain American attention.”</p>
                    <p>As I understood your statement of the “priorities” of this Administration, it
                        took basic account of these realities of strategic and economic
                        relationships which Henry had reluctantly faced after 1973 but could not
                        adapt to without surrendering the primacy of “cooperation” over
                        “competition” on the East-West front.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Human rights</hi> meant recognition of the necessity of a
                        national consensus for the main thrusts of any foreign policy, and it meant
                        recognition that some foreign policies and alliances are not viable for the
                        U.S. if our political values conflict too sharply.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Emphasis on the tri-lateral region</hi> meant recognition
                        of the true sources of our economic, political, and potentially, our
                        military power. And it meant recognizing that a large number of problems of
                        interdependency have been neglected for some time.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">A new context for the East-West relationship</hi> meant
                        evading the Soviet strategy taken from “two tactics” and “primitive
                        socialist accumulation.” It meant leaving the cooperative door open, but it
                        also excluded the practice of paying the Soviets to behave, to refrain from
                        bully-boy tactics in international affairs.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Attention to the North-South dimension</hi> meant a lot of
                        things, many of which strike me as still muddled and confused, but it put
                        priority on the <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> connection in the
                        international economic structure, and it seemed to recognize changing power
                        realities in the third world as more than a simple function of the East-West
                        competition.</p>
                    <pb n="316" facs="0357" xml:id="pg_316"/>
                    <p>Those priorities strike me as sound for 1970, 1973, 1977 and for the
                        foreseeable future. Looking back over the year, however, I find a number of
                        mistakes in our managing of these priorities.</p>
                    <p>The opening shots on the East-West front last spring were well aimed, and we
                        appeared launched on a promising campaign, clarifying the realities of the
                        relationship and the price of the game. By summer, however, our policy was
                        shot through with schizophrenia. Dropping off the comprehensive <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> proposal and allowing confusion to creep
                        into the human rights policy, muting it, put the Administration right back
                        in Henry’s position. On the one hand, it appeared that we might indeed make
                        the East-West relationship fit the realities of a “new context.” On the
                        other hand, we seemed to believe that politically we need a <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> deal as badly as the Soviets do.
                        Moreover, putting <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> above the West-West
                        relationship (<gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>) was bound to create
                        difficulties with the allies, as it clearly is doing. And it was bound to
                        give the Chinese cause to lecture us just the way they lectured Henry about
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>The proliferation of other arms talks, in a different context, could be a
                        strong gambit, but in the present context, it may be confusing to our
                        allies, the Soviets and to our own public and the Congress. It locks us more
                        firmly in Henry’s predicament of an unrealistic promise of what the talks
                        will yield and prevents their effective use as part of a political
                        strategy.</p>
                    <p>The only part of the East-West front where we have avoided a misstep is in
                        economic interaction. The <persName corresp="#p_JHM_1"

                        preventing movement while we are not organized for a coherent strategy in
                        trade, credits and technology. Here we need both a strategy and an Executive
                        Branch organization for controlling the East-West economic interaction in
                        and for cooperation with the Congress. In the best event, the returns on
                        this front will be modest, but certainly we can avoid “giving away the
                        farm,” or creating that impression.</p>
                    <p>How can we overcome this schizophrenia in East-West relations?</p>
                    <p>First, we must realize that politically Moscow needs <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> much worse than we do. We only need
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> if it is something like the
                        comprehensive proposal, i.e., if it constrains and reduces in a very
                        significant—not a marginal—way. The Soviets greatly need the talks
                        politically as “the centerpiece” of East-West relations. For Moscow, <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> must represent to the American public
                        the only thing that is saving the West from the Soviet military arsenal: it
                        must keep our political attention. Otherwise, the East-West relation will
                        appear less important, <pb n="317" facs="0358" xml:id="pg_317"/>which it is,
                        except when Moscow rattles its sabre occasionally, something that Henry
                        discovered can happen with or without <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                        >SALT</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>This year, we should slowly build public patience on the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> front. Moscow will be faced with paying
                        a price for our attention. As long as we are even and deliberate, the
                        Soviets will stay with the negotiation process. They simply have no viable
                        alternative except a rapprochement with China, something that will not solve
                        the economic and political stagnation in either China or the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>On the economic front there should be lots of anticipation and very little
                        movement. In the interim, we must get the legislation and the Executive
                        organization in place to implement effectively a national strategy in the
                        economic relations in the event that Moscow chooses to try to avoid
                        historical irrelevancy by opening its economy to the West on some principles
                        other than “primitive socialist accumulation.”</p>
                    <p>Effective management of the East-West relation seems to require two kinds of
                        tensions. First, in our relationship with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss>, the seeking, not the reaching, is the most important
                        thing about negotiations, be they economic or arms control. I am most
                        impressed at the moderation in Soviet behavior that comes when they are
                        anticipating some gain, some policy goal, not after they achieve it. The
                        Soviet anticipation of the 1974 trade agreement was enormous, and their
                        manners were much better than usual. The let down from the collapse of the
                        trade agreement was probably not much greater than it would have been had
                        the deal been completed.</p>
                    <p>The second kind of tension is between the U.S. and the <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies over European security. The
                        alliance thrives when we are threatening to pull out <hi rend="italic"
                            >and</hi> when the Soviets look menacing. We need a little of both, but
                        not too much of either.</p>
                    <p>Our priorities in 1977 seemed most likely to create an effective mix of these
                        tensions. The confusion seems to have come from alternative views of the
                        past: the <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> aspirations of
                        1972 versus the realities of post-1973. Given Soviet internal conditions and
                        objective international conditions, Brezhnev does not have the option of
                        meeting those earlier aspirations. We must keep the cooperative door open
                        but expect little response. That won’t make spectacular press for our
                        policy, but it will make good history.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Seventy-five years ago, our Nation signed a treaty which gave us rights to
                        build a canal across Panama, to take the historic step of joining the
                        Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.<note n="2" xml:id="d67fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d33fn6">footnote 6, Document 33</ref>.</note> The results
                        of the agreement have been of great benefit to ourselves and to other
                        nations throughout the world who navigate the high seas.</p>
                    <p>The building of the canal was one of the greatest engineering feats of
                        history. Although massive in concept and construction, it’s relatively
                        simple in design and has been reliable and efficient in operation. We
                        Americans are justly and deeply proud of this great achievement.</p>
                    <p>The canal has also been a source of pride and benefit to the people of
                        Panama—but a cause of some continuing discontent. Because we have controlled
                        a 10-mile-wide strip of land across the heart of their country and because
                        they considered the original terms of the agreement to be unfair, the people
                        of Panama have been dissatisfied with the treaty. It was drafted here in our
                        country and was not signed by any Panamanian. Our own Secretary of State who
                        did sign the original treaty said it was “vastly advantageous to the United
                        States and . . . not so advantageous to Panama.”<note n="3" xml:id="d67fn3"

                    <p>In 1964, after consulting with former Presidents <persName corresp="#p_THS_1"

                            >Johnson</persName> committed our Nation to work towards a new treaty
                        with the Republic of Panama. And last summer, after 14 years of negotiation
                        under two Democratic Presidents and two Republican Presidents, we reached
                        and signed an agreement that is fair and beneficial to both countries.<note

                                56</ref>.</note> The United States Senate will soon be debating
                        whether these treaties should be ratified.</p>
                    <pb n="319" facs="0360" xml:id="pg_319"/>
                    <p>Throughout the negotiations, we were determined that our national security
                        interests would be protected; that the canal would always be open and
                        neutral and available to ships of all nations; that in time of need or
                        emergency our warships would have the right to go to the head of the line
                        for priority passage through the canal; and that our military forces would
                        have the permanent right to defend the canal if it should ever be in danger.
                        The new treaties meet all of these requirements.</p>
                    <p>Let me outline the terms of the agreement. There are two treaties—one
                        covering the rest of this century, and the other guaranteeing the safety,
                        openness, and neutrality of the canal after the year 1999, when Panama will
                        be in charge of its operation.</p>
                    <p>For the rest of this century, we will operate the canal through a nine-person
                        board of directors. Five members will be from the United States and four
                        will be from Panama. Within the area of the present Canal Zone, we have the
                        right to select whatever lands and waters our military and civilian forces
                        need to maintain, to operate, and to defend the canal.</p>
                    <p>About 75 percent of those who now maintain and operate the canal are
                        Panamanians; over the next 22 years, as we manage the canal together, this
                        percentage will increase. The Americans who work on the canal will continue
                        to have their rights of employment, promotion, and retirement carefully
                        protected.</p>
                    <p>We will share with Panama some of the fees paid by shippers who use the
                        canal. As in the past, the canal should continue to be self-supporting.</p>
                    <p>This is not a partisan issue. The treaties are strongly backed by President
                            <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Gerald Ford</persName> and by Former
                        Secretaries of State <persName corresp="#p_RD_1">Dean Rusk</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Henry Kissinger</persName>. They are
                        endorsed by our business and professional leaders, especially those who
                        recognize the benefits of good will and trade with other nations in this
                        hemisphere. And they were endorsed overwhelmingly by the Senate Foreign
                        Relations Committee which, this week, moved closer to ratification by
                        approving the treaties, although with some recommended changes which we do
                        not feel are needed.<note n="5" xml:id="d67fn5">The Senate Foreign Relations

                    <p>The treaties also have been overwhelmingly supported throughout Latin
                        America, but predictably, they are opposed abroad by some who are unfriendly
                        to the United States and who would like to see disorder in Panama and a
                        disruption of our political, economic, and military ties with our friends in
                        Central and South America and in the Caribbean.</p>
                    <p>I know that the treaties also have been opposed by many Americans. Much of
                        that opposition is based on misunderstanding and misinformation. I’ve found
                        that when the full terms of the agreement are known, most people are
                        convinced that the national interests of our country will be served best by
                        ratifying the treaties.</p>
                    <p>Tonight, I want you to hear the facts. I want to answer the most serious
                        questions and tell you why I feel the Panama Canal treaties should be
                        approved.</p>
                    <p>The most important reason—the only reason—to ratify the treaties is that they
                        are in the highest national interest of the United States and will
                        strengthen our position in the world. Our security interests will be
                        stronger. Our trade opportunities will be improved. We will demonstrate that
                        as a large and powerful country, we are able to deal fairly and honorably
                        with a proud but smaller sovereign nation. We will honor our commitment to
                        those engaged in world commerce that the Panama Canal will be open and
                        available for use by their ships—at a reasonable and competitive cost—both
                        now and in the future.</p>
                    <p>Let me answer specifically the most common questions about the treaties.</p>
                    <p>Will our Nation have the right to protect and defend the canal against any
                        armed attack or threat to the security of the canal or of ships going
                        through it?</p>
                    <p>The answer is yes, and is contained in both treaties and also in the
                        statement of understanding between the leaders of our two nations.<note
                            n="6" xml:id="d67fn6">A joint statement of understanding was issued on

                    </p>
                    <p>The first treaty says, and I quote: “The United States of America and the
                        Republic of Panama commit themselves to protect and defend <pb n="321"
                            facs="0362" xml:id="pg_321"/>the Panama Canal. Each Party shall act, in
                        accordance with its constitutional processes, to meet the danger resulting
                        from an armed attack or other actions which threaten the security of the
                        Panama Canal or [of] ships transiting it.”</p>
                    <p>The neutrality treaty says, and I quote again: “The United States of America
                        and the Republic of Panama agree to maintain the regime of neutrality
                        established in this Treaty, which shall be maintained in order that the
                        Canal shall remain permanently neutral. . . .”</p>
                    <p>And to explain exactly what that means, the statement of understanding says,
                        and I quote again: “Under (the Neutrality Treaty), Panama and the United
                        States have the responsibility to assure that the Panama Canal will remain
                        open and secure to ships of all nations. The correct interpretation of this
                        principle is that each of the two countries shall, in accordance with their
                        respective constitutional processes, defend the Canal against any threat to
                        the regime of neutrality, and consequently [shall] have the right to act
                        against the Canal or against the peaceful transit of vessels through the
                        Canal.”</p>
                    <p>It is obvious that we can take whatever military action is necessary to make
                        sure that the canal always remains open and safe.</p>
                    <p>Of course, this does not give the United States any right to intervene in the
                        internal affairs of Panama, nor would our military action ever be directed
                        against the territorial integrity or the political independence of
                        Panama.</p>
                    <p>Military experts agree that even with the Panamanian Armed Forces joined with
                        us as brothers against a common enemy, it would take a large number of
                        American troops to ward off a heavy attack. I, as President, would not
                        hesitate to deploy whatever armed forces are necessary to defend the canal,
                        and I have no doubt that even in a sustained combat, that we would be
                        successful. But there is a much better way than sending our sons and
                        grandsons to fight in the jungles of Panama.</p>
                    <p>We would serve our interests better by implementing the new treaties, an
                        action that will help to avoid any attack on the Panama Canal.</p>
                    <p>What we want is the permanent right to use the canal—and we can defend this
                        right through the treaties—through real cooperation with Panama. The
                        citizens of Panama and their government have already shown their support of
                        the new partnership, and a protocol to the neutrality treaty will be signed
                        by many other nations, thereby showing their strong approval.</p>
                    <p>The new treaties will naturally change Panama from a passive and sometimes
                        deeply resentful bystander into an active and interested partner, whose
                        vital interests will be served by a well-operated canal. This agreement
                        leads to cooperation and not confrontation between our country and
                        Panama.</p>
                    <pb n="322" facs="0363" xml:id="pg_322"/>
                    <p>Another question is: Why should we give away the Panama Canal Zone? As many
                        people say, “We bought it, we paid for it, it’s ours.”</p>
                    <p>I must repeat a very important point: We do not own the Panama Canal Zone. We
                        have never had sovereignty over it. We have only had the right to use
                        it.</p>
                    <p>The Canal Zone cannot be compared with United States territory. We bought
                        Alaska from the Russians, and no one has ever doubted that we own it. We
                        bought the Louisiana Purchases—Territories from France, and that’s an
                        integral part of the United States.</p>
                    <p>From the beginning, we have made an annual payment to Panama to use their
                        land. You do not pay rent on your own land. The Panama Canal Zone has always
                        been Panamanian territory. The U.S. Supreme Court and previous American
                        Presidents have repeatedly acknowledged the sovereignty of Panama over the
                        Canal Zone.</p>
                    <p>We’ve never needed to own the Panama Canal Zone, any more than we need to own
                        a 10-mile-wide strip of land all the way through Canada from Alaska when we
                        build an international gas pipeline.</p>
                    <p>The new treaties give us what we do need—not ownership of the canal, but the
                        right to use it and to protect it. As the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
                        Staff has said, “The strategic value of the canal lies in its use.”</p>
                    <p>There’s another question: Can our naval ships, our warships, in time of need
                        or emergency, get through the canal immediately instead of waiting in
                        line?</p>
                    <p>The treaties answer that clearly by guaranteeing that our ships will always
                        have expeditious transit through the canal. To make sure that there could be
                        no possible disagreement about what these words mean, the joint statement
                        says that expeditious transit, and I quote, “is intended . . . to assure the
                        transit of such vessels through the Canal as quickly as possible, without
                        any impediment, with expedited treatment, and in case of need or emergency,
                        to go to the head of the line of vessels in order to transit the Canal
                        rapidly.”</p>
                    <p>Will the treaties affect our standing in Latin America? Will they create a
                        so-called power vacuum, which our enemies might move in to fill? They will
                        do just the opposite. The treaties will increase our Nation’s influence in
                        this hemisphere, will help to reduce any mistrust and disagreement, and they
                        will remove a major source of anti-American feeling.</p>
                    <p>The new agreement has already provided vivid proof to the people of this
                        hemisphere that a new era of friendship and cooperation is beginning and
                        that what they regard as the last remnant of alleged American colonialism is
                        being removed.</p>

                    <p>Last fall, I met individually with the leaders of 18 countries in this
                            hemisphere.<note n="7" xml:id="d67fn7">
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> met with Latin American
                            leaders in September 1977 during the signing ceremonies for the Panama
                            Canal treaties.</note> Between the United States and Latin America there
                        is already a new sense of equality, a new sense of trust and mutual respect
                        that exists because of the Panama Canal treaties. This opens up a fine
                        opportunity for us in good will, trade, jobs, exports, and political
                        cooperation.</p>
                    <p>If the treaties should be rejected, this would all be lost, and
                        disappointment and despair among our good neighbors and traditional friends
                        would be severe.</p>
                    <p>In the peaceful struggle against alien ideologies like communism, these
                        treaties are a step in the right direction. Nothing could strengthen our
                        competitors and adversaries in this hemisphere more than for us to reject
                        this agreement.</p>
                    <p>What if a new sea-level canal should be needed in the future? This question
                        has been studied over and over throughout this century, from before the time
                        the canal was built up through the last few years. Every study has reached
                        the same conclusion—that the best place to build a sea-level canal is in
                        Panama.</p>
                    <p>The treaties say that if we want to build such a canal, we will build it in
                        Panama, and if any canal is to be built in Panama, that we, the United
                        States, will have the right to participate in the project.</p>
                    <p>This is a clear benefit to us, for it ensures that, say, 10 or 20 years from
                        now, no unfriendly but wealthy power will be able to purchase the right to
                        build a sea-level canal, to bypass the existing canal, perhaps leaving that
                        other nation in control of the only usable waterway across the isthmus.</p>
                    <p>Are we paying Panama to take the canal? We are not. Under the new treaty, any
                        payments to Panama will come from tolls paid by ships which use the
                        canal.</p>
                    <p>What about the present and the future stability and the capability of the
                        Panamanian Government? Do the people of Panama themselves support the
                        agreement?</p>
                    <p>Well, as you know, Panama and her people have been our historical allies and
                        friends. The present leader of Panama has been in office for more than 9
                        years, and he heads a stable government which has encouraged the development
                        of free enterprise in Panama. Democratic elections will be held this August
                        to choose the members of the Panamanian Assembly, who will in turn elect a
                        President and a Vice President by majority vote. In the past, regimes have
                        changed in Panama, <pb n="324" facs="0365" xml:id="pg_324"/>but for 75
                        years, no Panamanian government has ever wanted to close the canal.</p>
                    <p>Panama wants the canal open and neutral—perhaps even more than we do. The
                        canal’s continued operation is very important to us, but it is much more
                        than that to Panama. To Panama, it’s crucial. Much of her economy flows
                        directly or indirectly from the canal. Panama would be no more likely to
                        neglect or to close the canal than we would be to close the Interstate
                        Highway System here in the United States.</p>
                    <p>In an open and free referendum last October, which was monitored very
                        carefully by the United Nations, the people of Panama gave the new treaties
                        their support.</p>
                    <p>The major threat to the canal comes not from any government of Panama, but
                        from misguided persons who may try to fan the flames of dissatisfaction with
                        the terms of the old treaty.</p>
                    <p>There’s a final question—about the deeper meaning of the treaties themselves,
                        to us and to Panama.</p>
                    <p>Recently, I discussed the treaties with <persName corresp="#p_MD_1">David
                            McCullough</persName>, author of “The Path Between the Seas,” the great
                        history of the Panama Canal.<note n="8" xml:id="d67fn8">
                            <hi rend="italic">The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama
                                Canal, 1870–1914</hi> (New York: <persName corresp="#p_SW_3"
                                >Simon</persName> and Schuster, 1977).</note> He believes that the
                        canal is something that we built and have looked after these many years; it
                        is “ours” in that sense, which is very different from just ownership.</p>
                    <p>So, when we talk of the canal, whether we are old, young, for or against the
                        treaties, we are talking about very deep and elemental feelings about our
                        own strength.</p>
                    <p>Still, we Americans want a more humane and stable world. We believe in good
                        will and fairness, as well as strength. This agreement with Panama is
                        something we want because we know it is right. This is not merely the surest
                        way to protect and save the canal, it’s a strong, positive act of a people
                        who are still confident, still creative, still great.</p>
                    <p>This new partnership can become a source of national pride and self-respect
                        in much the same way that building the canal was 75 years ago. It’s the
                        spirit in which we act that is so very important.</p>
                    <p>Theodore Roosevelt, who was President when America built the canal, saw
                        history itself as a force, and the history of our own time and the changes
                        it has brought would not be lost on him. He knew that change was inevitable
                        and necessary. Change is growth. The true conservative, he once remarked,
                        keeps his face to the future.</p>
                    <p>But if Theodore Roosevelt were to endorse the treaties, as I’m quite sure he
                        would, it would be mainly because he could see the decision as <pb n="325"
                            facs="0366" xml:id="pg_325"/>one by which we are demonstrating the kind
                        of great power we wish to be.</p>
                    <p>“We cannot avoid meeting great issues,” <persName corresp="#p_RFD_1"
                            >Roosevelt</persName> said. “All that we can determine for ourselves is
                        whether we shall meet them well or ill.”<note n="9" xml:id="d67fn9"
                            >Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_RFD_1">Roosevelt</persName>’s
                            1899 speech entitled “The Strenuous Life.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Panama Canal is a vast, heroic expression of that age-old desire to
                        bridge the divide and to bring people closer together. This is what the
                        treaties are all about.</p>
                    <p>We can sense what <persName corresp="#p_RFD_1">Roosevelt</persName> called
                        “the lift toward nobler things which marks a great and generous people.”</p>
                    <p>In this historic decision, he would join us in our pride for being a great
                        and generous people, with the national strength and wisdom to do what is
                        right for us and what is fair to others.</p>
                    <p>Thank you very much.</p>

                    <p>You should start giving more serious thought to, and personally engage in
                        some discussion of, three developments which cumulatively may adversely
                        affect the overall global position of the United States. These are:</p>
                    <p>1. Growing indications of political instability in Western Europe;<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d68fn2">The President placed a question mark in the right-hand

                    <p>2. The potential consequences of major Soviet/Cuban success in Ethiopia;<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d68fn3">The President wrote “agree” in the right-hand
                            margin next to this point.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. Our failure to exploit politically our relatively favored position in the
                        U.S.-Soviet-Chinese triangle.<note n="4" xml:id="d68fn4">The President wrote
                            “Later—(post-Panama)” in the right-hand margin next to this
                            point.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The cumulative effect of these trends could be very serious internationally
                        and then domestically. By the fall we could be under attack for having
                        presided over a grave deterioration in the U.S. global position. In that
                        setting, <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> will not have a chance, and
                        our ability to deal with other issues will be severely reduced.</p>
                    <p>The linchpin of our policy towards the Soviet Union has been a strong Western
                        Europe, closely tied to the United States; moreover, in recent years we have
                        subtly and cautiously exploited Soviet fears of China to encourage Soviet
                        restraint. Given present trends, our first asset—Western Europe—may be
                        partially undermined from within.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, we have failed almost entirely to take advantage of the
                        opportunity inherent in the Sino-Soviet hostility, while concentrating
                        heavily on enlarging the scope of U.S.-Soviet negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Political trends in Western Europe are ominous. The Italians have in effect
                        cut a deal with the Communist party that will bring them into the
                        Parliamentary coalition. The French left coalition of the Socialist and
                        Communist is the favorite to win the March elections.<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d68fn5">The President underlined the word “favorite” and placed
                            a question mark in the right-hand margin next to this sentence.</note>
                        German politics are increasingly manifesting neutralism and anti-U.S.
                        symptoms, while <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName>’s economic
                        policy is not helpful to the West’s overall political and economic
                            strength.<note n="6" xml:id="d68fn6">The President underlined the phrase
                            “anti-U.S.” and wrote “True” in the right-hand margin next to this

                            >NATO</gloss> force improvements—though desirable—increasingly looks
                        like we are using military measures to prop up a politically weakening
                        alliance. In sum, by the end of March we could see major Communist advances
                        in Europe, and then an important backlash at home with the Administration
                        being criticized for doing too little too late.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, demonstrable Soviet success in the African Horn is likely
                        to have a very direct psychological and political impact on Egypt, Sudan,
                        Saudi Arabia and Iran.<note n="7" xml:id="d68fn7">In the left-hand margin
                            next to this sentence, the President wrote: “Iran, SA, Egypt should
                            stand firm re crossing of Somali border.”</note> It will simply
                        demonstrate to all concerned that the Soviet Union has the will and the
                        capacity to assert itself. This will encourage Libya and Algeria to act more
                        aggressively; it will also make more likely increased Cuban involvement in
                        the Rhode<pb n="327" facs="0368" xml:id="pg_327"/>sian conflict. In effect,
                        first through a proxy (as in Angola) and now more directly (as in Ethiopia)
                        the Soviet Union will be demonstrating that containment has now been fully
                        breached.</p>
                    <p>Finally, in part because of Chinese rigidity,<note n="8" xml:id="d68fn8">The
                            President underlined the phrase “Chinese rigidity” and wrote “yes” in

                        in part because (in my judgment) of excessive sensitivity to the

                        this out, there is no reason why the consultative relationship—resting quite
                        frankly on a shared concern over Soviet aggressiveness—should not be

                        our control) occur. I think one approach would be to have some key senators
                        in to see you for a discussion of what might be done as a way of sharing
                        with them the limited range of <pb n="328" facs="0369" xml:id="pg_328"
                        />options before us and of encouraging them therefore to produce a more
                        understanding reaction, if these developments take place.<note n="14"

                    <p>I am delighted to be here today among so many old friends. Last August, I had
                        the good fortune of addressing the Gavel Awards luncheon at the American Bar
                        Association convention.<note n="2" xml:id="d69fn2">For text of address, see
                            BULLETIN of Aug. 29, 1977, p. 269. [Footnote in the original.]</note> On
                        that occasion I discussed the principles that guide one of the most
                        important foreign policy initiatives of the <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> Administration—the human rights policy.</p>
                    <p>Today, after 1 year’s experience with that policy, I would like to talk about
                        how those principles have been put into practice—to talk about the diplomacy
                        of human rights.</p>
                    <p>Before doing so, let me remind you that our policy concerns three categories
                        of rights:</p>
                    <p>• The right to be free from governmental violations of the integrity of the
                        person;</p>
                    <p>• The right to fulfill one’s vital needs such as food, shelter, health care,
                        and education; and</p>
                    <p>• Civil and political rights.</p>
                    <p>In his inaugural address, President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> set the tone for a foreign policy based firmly on our
                        values as a nation. “Because we are free,” he said, “we can never be
                        indifferent to the fate of freedom elsewhere.”<note n="3" xml:id="d69fn3"

                        much has flowed, the President was expressing an old and sometimes ignored
                        truth with new vigor.</p>
                    <p>Our strength as a nation and our magnetism to the world at large are
                        predicated on our commitment to human rights. It is only proper that the
                        human rights considerations so important to our national life be reflected
                        in our international life as well. This means they must be fully integrated
                        into our diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>The pursuit of this cause is not an ideological luxury cruise with no
                        practical port of call. Our idealism and our self-interest coincide.
                        Widening the circle of countries which share our human rights values is at
                        the very core of our security interests. Such nations make strong allies.
                        Their commitment to human rights gives them an inner strength and stability
                        which causes them to stand steadfastly with us on the most difficult issues
                        of our time.</p>
                    <p>In this first year, I have been impressed by what a subtle, creative, and
                        flexible process diplomacy can be in advancing the cause of human rights.
                        Diplomacy is not just words—though words can be highly effective. It is also
                        an impressive variety of intangible symbols and gestures, as well as
                        tangible measures.</p>
                    <p>Diplomacy can be a rich mix, indeed. In the case of our human rights
                        objectives, we have evolved a mix that is proving effective.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Capsule View of the Diplomacy</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Frank Discussion.</hi> The primary ingredient of human
                        rights diplomacy has a seeming simplicity: We frankly discuss human rights
                        in our consultations with foreign diplomats and leaders. An obvious
                        technique, yes. Just words, yes. But I must tell you that many of us have
                        been amazed at its effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>A career Foreign Service Officer told me recently that until last January it
                        would have been unusual for our ambassador to raise with the leader of
                        another country, in face-to-face conversation, the fate of political
                        prisoners. Our diplomats tended to shy away from direct high-level dialogue
                        on such sensitive human rights issues.</p>
                    <p>That has changed. Time after time in the past year we have had such
                        conversations. And very often these very frank discussions have led to
                        beneficial results. Sovereign governments have reexamined conditions in
                        their capitals and provinces, and releases of prisoners and other positive
                        actions have followed.</p>
                    <p>When we raise human rights with another government, we take an affirmative
                        stance. We explain that our people, our Congress, and our government are
                        deeply troubled by the human rights abuses we believe to be occurring. And
                        we ask for the other government’s assessment of the situation and the
                        prospects for improvement. Sometimes, it is true, the response is truculent
                        and defensive. Sometimes, we are <pb n="330" facs="0371" xml:id="pg_330"
                        />charged with “intervening” in the internal affairs of another sovereign
                        state.</p>
                    <p>But much more often, the response is a real effort to join issue on the
                        merits. Frequently, there is candid acknowledgment of the validity of our
                        interest—an interest rooted in solemn international agreements that make the
                        way a government treats its own citizens a matter of legitimate
                        international concern.</p>
                    <p>Just as frequently there is disagreement over the degree and the causes of
                        the problem. It is often asserted, for example, that terrorism justifies
                        repression. But usually these differences in perspective are overtaken by a
                        consideration of possible improvements. By consideration, for example, of
                        whether:</p>
                    <p>• Those held without trial, often incommunicado and for lengthy periods, can
                        soon be released or at least charged and tried;</p>
                    <p>• The return to civilian rule can proceed on schedule; or</p>
                    <p>• Those responsible for mistreating prisoners will be prosecuted.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes we achieve explicit understandings on such issues. More commonly
                        there is an implicit recognition of the need for improvement and for further
                        consultations as the situation evolves. Either way, the raising of the issue
                        has profound significance. Rather than being conveniently ignored, human
                        rights abuses are brought to the center of the diplomatic interchange.
                        There, they must be addressed.</p>
                    <p>I believe the almost geometric increase in world awareness of human rights
                        issues is perhaps the major accomplishment of our human rights diplomacy.
                        This new consciousness not only helps curb existing human rights abuses, it
                        also acts as a deterrent to new violations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Symbolic Acts.</hi> The words of human rights diplomacy
                        can effectively be joined with symbolic acts. For example, trips to other
                        countries by our senior officials and official invitations to the leaders of
                        other nations to visit the United States can be used to advance our human
                        rights objectives. Such visits can mark our recognition that a country has
                        an outstanding human rights record or provide the opportunity to discuss
                        human rights problems with the leader of a country where improvements are
                        urgently needed.</p>
                    <p>There are a host of other measures that can be used symbolically to send the
                        desired signal, such as: cultural and educational exchanges; selection of
                        the site of international conferences; the level of our representation at
                        diplomatic events; port visits by our fleet. Carefully used, such symbols
                        and gestures can help advance the cause of human rights.</p>
                    <p>There is also significance in our willingness to meet, on appropriate
                        occasions, with opposition leaders from countries with serious human rights
                        problems. My colleagues and I have met with a number of such leaders in
                        Washington—including some who are living in exile <pb n="331" facs="0372"
                            xml:id="pg_331"/>from their homeland. And abroad, our ambassadors
                        regularly meet with opposition leaders.</p>
                    <p>These meetings enable us to hear both sides of the story, to learn how a
                        human rights problem is seen by those directly affected, and to demonstrate
                        that we are concerned about all the people of the country involved, not just
                        those in power.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Public Comment.</hi> Beyond private diplomatic discourse
                        and important symbolic steps, the diplomacy of human rights must sometimes
                        include criticism of regimes implicated in serious human rights
                        violations.</p>
                    <p>Public comment by our government is an official act that directs the
                        attention of the entire world to the objectionable practices of another
                        government. We believe that such criticism can have some inhibiting effect
                        on such governments. We do not generally prefer this approach but neither
                        will we shrink from it.</p>
                    <p>Needless to say, public comment has been our first line of approach with
                        respect to countries like Cambodia and Uganda, where we have little or no
                        diplomatic contact but yet where unspeakable violations of human rights are
                        occurring as a matter of deliberate state policy. We deplore these policies.
                        We hope other governments which have the contact that we lack can make known
                        the extent of international concern and bring about improvements.</p>
                    <p>We have also, of course, spoken openly and forthrightly at the Belgrade
                        meeting that has been reviewing implementation of the Helsinki Final
                            Act.<note n="4" xml:id="d69fn4">For an outline of the Conference on
                            Security and Cooperation in Europe (<gloss target="#t_CSCE_1"

                            original.]</note> That document contemplates a full and frank review of
                        whether the signatories have lived up to their human rights commitments. It
                        is clear that the Soviet Union and the East European countries, in varying
                        degrees, have not done so. We have not hesitated to say so publicly, to
                        request an explanation, and to seek compliance.</p>
                    <p>Our comments and those of West European governments have helped sustain the
                        Helsinki accord as a living force in the cause of human rights, an engine
                        for keeping constant pressure on governments to respect the rights of their
                        people. Our silence would have effectively permitted that force to fade
                        away.</p>
                    <p>In speaking of our public efforts, I should note that we are actively using
                        our public diplomacy tools such as the U.S. Information Agency to convey our
                        human rights concerns to various nongovernmental audiences abroad. The Voice
                        of America has increased its attention to these issues. Our embassies and
                        offices abroad have organized sem<pb n="332" facs="0373" xml:id="pg_332"
                        />inars in which thoughtful Americans can directly express their human
                        rights concerns to people from similar walks of life in foreign
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Our human rights initiative has given recognition and a new stimulus to the
                        longstanding efforts of private nongovernmental organizations in this field.
                        We applaud these endeavors and recognize that over time they may well
                        outdistance any governmental effort.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Appropriate Action.</hi> When our relationship with
                        another government includes economic and military assistance, we are
                        prepared to take tangible steps to recognize good human rights performance
                        or to manifest our concern over human rights violations. When appropriate or
                        necessary, in other words, we will support our words with actions. In taking
                        such steps, we are guided and strengthened by important legislative
                        provisions enacted by a Congress overwhelmingly committed to the cause of
                        human rights.</p>
                    <p>Taking due account of the needs of the poorest, we have made a fundamental
                        decision gradually to channel a growing share of our economic assistance to
                        countries that respect the human rights of their people.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, when countries we assist consistently curtail human
                        rights, and where our preferred diplomatic efforts have been unavailing, we
                        must consider restrictions on the flow of our aid, both overall levels and
                        individual loans or grants. Thus, over the course of the past year we have,
                        for example:</p>
                    <p>• Deferred bilateral economic assistance to certain countries;</p>
                    <p>• Opposed loans by the World Bank and the other international financial
                        institutions to countries that engage in flagrant violations of human
                        rights; and</p>
                    <p>• Taken steps to insure that food aid provided to countries with serious
                        human rights problems will reach the needy.</p>
                    <p>We have also advised other departments of the government on human rights
                        conditions abroad that may affect their activities. For example, a recently
                        enacted statute calls for the Export-Import Bank to take human rights
                        considerations into account, and the Bank regularly seeks advice on this
                            issue.<note n="5" xml:id="d69fn5">Presumable reference to <gloss

                    <p>Human rights performance is also an important factor in our decisions on

                    <p>The diversity of cultures and the different stages of economic and political
                        maturity tend to produce agonizing, almost incredibly complex, choices in
                        granting or withholding aid. Moreover, human rights, while a fundamental
                        factor in our foreign policy, cannot always be the decisive factor. But the
                        difficulty of the decisions will not deter us from supporting our words with
                        action.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">International Support.</hi> It is important to note that
                        we are not alone in pursuing the diplomacy of human rights. Increasingly,
                        other governments are standing with us. In the United Nations, in the
                        Organization of American States, and in other contexts we have strong
                        partners in the cause of human rights. Recently, we initiated consultations
                        with our West European allies and others on how to promote broader
                        international cooperation in support of human rights. In general, we are
                        finding strong support for giving human rights a higher priority in
                        international relations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Human Rights Data Base.</hi> As I reflect on the first
                        year of human rights diplomacy, there is one area in which I would like to
                        ask for the creative thinking and counsel of this great association. I refer
                        to the need I perceive for an objective, authenticated data base on human
                        rights conditions in all countries.</p>
                    <p>Let me put the problem in perspective. With the aid of our embassies around
                        the world, we are constantly trying to gather reliable and extensive human
                        rights data. Nevertheless, the validity of our information on human rights
                        conditions in other countries is frequently challenged. Probably it is
                        inevitable that the data collected by any one country would be suspect.
                        Coverage is bound to be limited, and there may be the suspicion that the
                        collecting country has an ax to grind.</p>
                    <p>What is needed is an objective, widely respected clearinghouse for human
                        rights information on all countries of the world. This would be an important
                        resource for us and others interested in taking human rights conditions in
                        other countries into account in policymaking. It would thus both inform our
                        decisions and authenticate the existence and severity of human rights
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps you will be able to suggest how such a clearinghouse might be
                        created. It is clear that it must be international in scope. What is not so
                        clear is whether it should be sponsored by a private organization or by a
                        group of countries or an international organization. Once created, I could
                        visualize that such an entity might also play an important educational role
                        in improving human rights conditions around the world. We stand ready to
                        help in creating such an organization.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Concerns</p>
                    <p>This then is a capsule view of the diplomacy of human rights. It is a
                        diplomacy that refuses to “be indifferent to the fate of freedom else<pb
                            n="334" facs="0375" xml:id="pg_334"/>where.” It is a diplomacy that has
                        permitted the United States to seize the initiative for human progress once
                        again. Surveys conducted abroad have shown time and time again that the
                        renewed interest in human values expressed by the President and implemented
                        by our diplomatic efforts has had an enormously positive impact on the view
                        people in foreign countries hold of America and our role in the world.</p>
                    <p>We are daily concerned with our government’s response to human rights
                        conditions in other countries. But our credibility—and indeed the inner
                        health of our society—depends upon facing up to our problems here at home
                        and seeking to improve our own human rights situation.</p>
                    <p>Much of President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>’s domestic
                        program is directed toward the enhancement of the human rights of Americans.
                        Proposals for welfare reform, efforts to cut the cost of health care, and
                        the commitment to full employment are obvious examples. We should also note
                        that, within the past year, travel restrictions for American citizens abroad
                        have been eliminated,<note n="6" xml:id="d69fn6">See <ref target="#d29fn15"
                                >footnote 15, Document 29</ref>.</note> and visa requirements for
                        foreigners coming to this country have been significantly eased.</p>
                    <p>It is well to remember that we are far from perfect. Our ample due process
                        with all its guarantees does not afford perfect justice. But whatever our
                        shortcomings, they are faced frankly and openly. The three constitutional
                        branches of government have the responsibility to do so. And the “fourth
                        branch” is there to insure that that responsibility is met.</p>

                    <p>In making human rights a fundamental tenet of our foreign policy and greatly
                        increasing sensitivity to human rights concerns, we have helped to create an
                        atmosphere in which human rights progress is much more likely to occur. We
                        do not take credit for particular improvements, but we note the tangible
                        evidence from every continent that the condition of large numbers of
                        people—of individual, identifiable human beings—is less oppressive now than
                        it seemed one year ago.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Problems</p>
                    <p>Despite these many improvements and others like them, the fact remains that
                        the distance covered is dwarfed by the distance that remains to be traveled.
                        I could recount in detail the retrograde human rights developments of the
                        past year, as well as the horrendous human <pb n="336" facs="0377"
                            xml:id="pg_336"/>rights violations that persist across the globe—in many
                        of the countries I have just mentioned as well as elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>• Suffice it to say that in all quarters of the world, too many people are
                        still subject to torture and are suffering in squalid prisons, uncharged and
                        untried.</p>
                    <p>• Too many people are hungry, have inadequate shelter, and lack medical care
                        and educational opportunity.</p>
                    <p>• Too many people are living under martial law or are otherwise barred from
                        political participation.</p>
                    <p>• Too many are denied the right to emigrate or even to travel freely within
                        their own country.</p>
                    <p>These problems are the challenges of the future. They will not be solved
                        easily. But our experience with 1 year of human rights diplomacy convinces
                        us that while the journey is long it is not impossible.</p>
                    <p>Of course none of us can know for sure where the progress of human rights may
                        lead. But every so often during the past year, as I have struggled to
                        understand the deep meaning of human rights, I have felt a fleeting
                        intimation of what untold spiritual and material riches may lie
                        ahead—perhaps centuries ahead—in a world of true, universal human freedom.
                        Justice <persName corresp="#p_HOW_1">Holmes</persName> perhaps had a similar
                        feeling—and certainly expressed it much better than I ever could—when he
                        said:</p>
                    <p>I think it not improbable that man, like the grub that prepares a chamber for
                        the winged thing it never has seen but is to be—that man may have cosmic
                        destinies that he does not understand. And so beyond the vision of battling
                        races and an impoverished earth I catch a dreaming glimpse of peace.</p>
                    <p>I think that in the last analysis the cause of human rights has power and
                        will succeed because, no matter what the obstacle, it tenaciously allows the
                        world’s people to “catch a dreaming glimpse of peace.”</p>

                    <p>For a generation our nation’s foreign policy has reflected a strong and
                        outward looking America. In this tradition, and building upon the
                        achievements of previous Administrations, we have over the past year
                        formulated our policies on the critical issues that will shape the remainder
                        of our lives, and those of the next generation.</p>

                        <hi rend="roman">1.</hi> The Complex International Agenda</p>
                    <p>As we look ahead to the 1980’s our nation faces complex international
                        challenges:</p>
                    <p>—The strategic arms race with the Soviet Union increases superpower tension
                        and the risk of nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>—The widening use of nuclear energy, necessary to the economic well-being of
                        many nations, threatens at the same time to promote the spread of nuclear
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>—Long standing regional disputes pose the constant threat of regional wars,
                        endangering world peace.</p>
                    <p>—Growing inventories of conventional weapons aggravate regional tensions and
                        waste scarce economic resources.</p>
                    <p>—Economic recovery in the industrial nations is not rapid enough; economic
                        development in the third world is a global concern; and both require the
                        strengthening of international economic cooperation.</p>
                    <p>—Fostering human rights in our own society and abroad is necessary to a just
                        international order and a measure of the vitality of our most basic values
                        as a nation.</p>
                    <pb n="338" facs="0379" xml:id="pg_338"/>
                    <p>The United States approaches these challenges with extraordinary human and
                        physical resources. Our unparalleled strength has its roots deep in the
                        character and nature of our country:</p>
                    <p>—The inherent strength and resiliency of our society;</p>
                    <p>—Our deep-seated respect for the rights and potential of the individual
                        regardless of circumstances of birth;</p>
                    <p>—Our economic power and resources;</p>
                    <p>—A superior technological and industrial base;</p>
                    <p>—A military capability second to none;</p>
                    <p>—A tradition of inventive diplomacy and a willingness to assume the
                        responsibilities of leadership.</p>
                    <p>Our strengths as a nation are amplified by our long-standing alliances with
                        other nations. We confront our challenges together.</p>
                    <p>Together, we also face a new pattern of international relations in the late
                        1970’s. For close to three decades, the Cold War dominated our view of the
                        world; today, we must deal with a pluralistic international setting of
                        several major dimensions:</p>
                    <p>—First are our ties to the democratic, industrial nations of Western Europe,
                        Canada, and Japan. These ties serve the central political, economic, and
                        military interests of the United States. They have proven their durability
                        and their continuing value. The cohesion and strength of these relationships
                        remain an essential precondition to progress in our other relations.</p>
                    <p>—There is the evolving East-West relationship, marked by continuing
                        competitive elements, and yet promising in its opportunities for
                        cooperation.</p>
                    <p>—Relations between the industrial societies and the developing nations now
                        touch every major issue before us. Increasingly, nations both North and
                        South recognize the need to seek common ground.</p>
                    <p>—Modern technology, while it has brought great benefits, has also created a
                        new set of challenges which are global in scope and in the necessary
                        dimensions of their resolution, developing and allocating scarce resources,
                        protecting the world environment, confronting the dangers of nuclear
                        proliferation, encouraging the free flow of information, applying medical
                        and agricultural knowledge to the enhancement of human life.</p>
                    <p>—The widening pattern of international associations, the economic, political,
                        technical and cultural bodies—public and private—plays an increasingly
                        important role in facilitating the cooperative efforts necessary to deal
                        effectively with international problems.</p>
                    <p>These elements interact to create a new pattern of international life and new
                        demands for diplomatic skill and creativity. Shifting coali<pb n="339"
                            facs="0380" xml:id="pg_339"/>tions among nations are coming together
                        around particular interests, often cutting across ideological, regional and
                        political lines. From the core relationship with our historical allies and
                        friends, we are able, on an increasing number of issues, to join together
                        with nations we have not worked closely with in the past. This is especially
                        true with the developing world. Moreover, when the nations of the communist
                        world seek constructive solutions to common problems, we and others are
                        ready to join with them. We seek the most inclusive coalitions that can be
                        effective in meeting the particular challenges before us.</p>
                    <p>We are also operating on the assumption that no animosity is so deep that
                        there is not some common ground. For instance, we find ourselves associated
                        with the Soviet Union on certain issues, such as the Law of the Seas, even
                        as we stand in opposition on other issues. At the same time, we recognize
                        that our alliances can never be so total that disagreements on some issues
                        are precluded.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that diverse and equally valid American goals may themselves
                        come into conflict, particularly over the short term. Thus, our interest in
                        secure energy supplies can conflict with our interest in preventing nuclear
                        proliferation, for nuclear energy without adequate safeguards can be used to
                        develop nuclear weapons. Our commitment to human rights may sometimes clash
                        with our desire to maintain close ties to countries whose cooperation we
                        need on security or economic issues.</p>
                    <p>The pursuit of our basic principles must therefore be flexible and pragmatic,
                        for balances inevitably must be struck. Both our principles and their
                        pragmatic pursuit are traditional American strengths. As we reassert the
                        international vitality of our national ideals, we must remain practical in
                        recognizing the limits to our power and the conflicting demands which our
                        ideals may make upon our policies. America has been most successful in the
                        world when it has maintained this sense of practical idealism.</p>
                    <p>The changing nature of international cooperation and competition, our diverse
                        interests in the world, the absence of armed conflicts involving American
                        force, all contribute to move American foreign policy beyond the generalized
                        doctrines of times past. Our policies do not lend themselves to simple
                        doctrinal explanations. We must therefore take special care to work closely
                        with the Congress, to open our policies to broad public discussion and to
                        encourage alternative points of view within the Administration itself. All
                        voices must be heard: America’s foreign policy cannot be sustained without
                        the understanding and support of the American people.</p>

                    <p>The decisions which the Administration, Congress and American people face in
                        1978 will be made, in large measure, within the context of <pb n="340"
                            facs="0381" xml:id="pg_340"/>the goals we set for ourselves during 1977.
                        In important respects, our choices in 1978 will shape the character of
                        America’s role in world affairs for years to come:</p>
                    <p>—We will persist in continuing long term efforts to promote human rights, to
                        check nuclear weapons proliferation and to restrain the growth in
                        conventional arms traffic.</p>
                    <p>—Ratification of the Panama Canal Treaties will secure our future interests
                        in the Canal and set the pattern for a healthy new relationship between big
                        powers and smaller countries, a relationship of clear mutual benefit and
                        respect.</p>
                    <p>—We will continue during the coming months to pursue a strategic arms
                        limitation agreement with the Soviet Union that will strengthen our security
                        as well as that of our allies, and reduce the risks and tensions that
                        accompany an uncontrolled nuclear weapons race. We will at the same time
                        press for a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing.</p>
                    <p>—Diplomacy for peace in the Middle East, southern Africa, and the Horn of
                        Africa will continue, in the hope that these particularly dangerous regional
                        disputes can be resolved.</p>
                    <p>—An effective American energy program must be enacted.</p>
                    <p>—We will pursue a more open trading system that serves the economies of all
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>—Through a more effective foreign aid program, we will seek to encourage the
                        growth and well-being of developing societies. Their economic progress will
                        promote our own.</p>
                    <p>We have always responded well as a nation to immediate challenges. Today,
                        more than ever, we face another critical test: whether we can rally for the
                        long haul, whether we can make the short-term sacrifices sometimes necessary
                        to secure our future interests.</p>
                    <p>We have emerged from our national ordeal in Vietnam. In 1978, a strong
                        America has the opportunity to show that we have the confidence to play a
                        positive role of world leadership. This positive American role is essential
                        if the world is to come to grips with the problems that could otherwise
                        engulf it.</p>
                    <p>The choices we face touch every American. While the immediate interests of
                        our citizens are diverse, over the longer run each of us shares an interest
                        in a foreign policy that serves three goals: to be true to our values, to
                        seek peace, and to enhance the well-being of our people and the peoples of
                        all nations. The body of this report addresses each of these fundamental
                        objectives.</p>
                    <p rend="center">II. VALUES</p>
                    <p>American values provide the base of our policy. Our concern for the welfare
                        of others coincides with our own national interest:</p>

                    <p>—to do what we can to alleviate injustice and tension before they erupt into
                        violence;</p>
                    <p>—to help reduce the threat of war and the high cost of military
                        establishments;</p>
                    <p>—to contribute to the global economic growth and equity on which our own
                        national prosperity depends.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Human Rights:</p>
                    <p>The human rights policy of this Administration most clearly represents the
                        application of our values to the practical decisions of foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>Our concern is for those human rights which have been recognized
                        internationally—in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Charter, the
                        Universal Declaration of Human Rights,<note n="2" xml:id="d70fn2">See <ref

                        final act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. <pb
                            n="342" facs="0383" xml:id="pg_342"/>These documents codify the right to
                        be free from torture or arbitrary arrest; the right to political freedom;
                        and basic economic rights and opportunities. Our focus on these human rights
                        is not an attempt to impose the American political system on others. These
                        rights can be enjoyed under various political systems and in differing
                        manner. They are rights to which all are entitled.</p>
                    <p>It is easy to be for all these rights in our rhetoric. Indeed no civilized
                        nation has ever declared itself against them. It is more complex to take the
                        human rights dimension into account in the major foreign policy decisions we
                        take. We are trying to do that. That is how we view our obligations to
                        American law and tradition.</p>
                    <p>Human rights concerns have been integrated into all levels of our dealings
                        with foreign governments—from Presidential exchanges to the discussions of
                        working level officials. It is clear to all governments that we consider how
                        they treat their own people as an important factor in all our dealings with
                        them.</p>
                    <p>We have affirmed our commitment to formal international standards—by finally
                        signing the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> covenants on economic,
                        social, and cultural rights and on civil and political rights<note n="4"

                            9</ref>.</note> and by signing the American Convention on Human Rights.
                        We are working to improve the human rights machinery of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> and the Organization of American States, and
                        to secure better implementation of the human rights provisions of the
                        Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. These multilateral efforts
                        are important since they emphasize that America is not preaching to the rest
                        of the world, but adding its voice to all the others who are working to
                        improve the plight of individuals.</p>
                    <p>Words must be supported with actions. Proposals for American assistance—loans
                        or grants through our aid program; our position on loans in the
                        international development banks; military assistance or even sales—are
                        carefully reviewed from a human rights point of view. This is a
                        time-consuming process, since we analyze the human rights situation in the
                        country concerned, who will benefit from the assistance, and how we can
                        effectively assist the cause of human rights and the lot of the
                        neediest.</p>
                    <p>We have modified aid allocations on human rights grounds and we are working
                        to ensure that our bilateral programs meet the basic human needs of the poor
                        for food, shelter, health care, and education. We oppose loans in the
                        international development banks to countries with serious human rights
                        problems, unless the loans are aimed at satisfying basic human needs. We
                        have accepted the fact that our relations with certain countries may be
                        strained as a result of our attention to human rights. As human rights
                        conditions improve, these strains should be eased.</p>
                    <p>It may be of interest to record some of the actual dilemmas we face, for
                        example, in linking human rights and foreign assistance. We often ask
                        ourselves: should we oppose a loan which could promote the economic
                        condition of poor people, in hopes of influencing their governments to
                        permit a greater exercise of political rights? Would withholding security
                        aid in a particular situation stimulate a siege mentality, leading to an
                        even harsher crackdown on dissident elements, or would its practical effect
                        be to promote human rights? How can we best show recognition of the progress
                        a society is making, and thus reinforce that process, even if the general
                        human rights situation remains unacceptable?</p>
                    <p>These and other hard questions require case-by-case analysis. Some observers
                        will find our choices inconsistent. This is because tactics should be
                        adaptable, although our goals are not. We will take those actions we believe
                        will be most effective in each country, and which are consistent with
                        statutory provisions designed to promote respect for internationally
                        recognized human rights.</p>
                    <p>We must also keep our human rights concerns in balance with other national
                        interests. We often must determine how best to respond to the needs of
                        individuals living under authoritarian regimes, while still retaining the
                        necessary cooperation of their governments on security or economic matters
                        that are vital to us. Even in striking this balance however, our broad goal
                        remains the same: economic and security <pb n="343" facs="0384"
                            xml:id="pg_343"/>policies, as well as policy on “human rights”, are
                        guided by a concern with the impact of all we do on the welfare of
                        individuals.</p>
                    <p>We are embarked on a long term endeavor. Progress must be measured over the
                        long run. This Administration will probably not see the full
                        results—successful or not—of our efforts in this field. Nor can we claim
                        credit for many decisions made by sovereign foreign governments. But we have
                        contributed to an international climate in which tangible progress was made
                        in 1977:</p>
                    <p>—Thousands of prisoners have been freed.</p>
                    <p>—Some political systems have become a little more open. States of siege have
                        ended and elections have been scheduled in a number of countries.</p>
                    <p>—International human rights commissions have been permitted to visit
                        countries formerly closed to them.</p>
                    <p>The world was not transformed by such events. But many individuals were
                        better off at the end of 1977 than at its beginning.</p>
                    <p>This is a sound beginning, but our experience has shown us that there are
                        sometimes even better ways to proceed:</p>
                    <p>—In this first year we have most often reacted to human rights violations by
                        reducing or ending economic or military assistance programs. We wish to
                        increasingly emphasize positive actions to help governments which are trying
                        to improve the lot of their own people. We are working to find ways to use
                        our assistance affirmatively, to promote human rights, rather than in ways
                        which are primarily punitive.</p>
                    <p>—We must work even more closely with international organizations and foreign
                        leaders to find the most constructive ways to advance human rights in
                        cultures and political traditions different from our own.</p>
                    <p>In our dealings with other nations and people we must recognize human rights
                        problems of our own. The President’s plans for welfare reform, urban
                        renewal, more jobs for disadvantaged youth, are all part of a commitment
                        constantly to improve our own human rights performance.</p>
                    <p>In sum, there has been a perceptible change in the international view of what
                        the United States stands for in the world. Our most durable source of
                        strength is the symbol of individual liberty and opportunity that we
                        represent to others.</p>

                        Well-Being.]</p>
                    <p rend="center">V. CONCLUSION</p>
                    <p>One year ago, we decided to give new priority to several complex longer-term
                        issues that are becoming increasingly important to our na<pb n="344"
                            facs="0385" xml:id="pg_344"/>tional interests: issues such as human
                        rights, energy, trade, nuclear non-proliferation, and conventional arms
                        sales.</p>
                    <p>We realized, but perhaps did not adequately explain to the American people,
                        that progress on these issues would be slow, and that by raising some of
                        them we would complicate certain of our bilateral relations.</p>
                    <p>We decided that these global problems had to be addressed at once, because it
                        is clear that we cannot approach the key issues in our foreign policy <hi
                            rend="italic">seriatim</hi>. For example, we cannot so concentrate our
                        energy on the political diplomacy of international peace, essential as it
                        is, that we discover, too late, that poverty and injustice within nations
                        makes peace among nations impossible.</p>
                    <p>The relationship between energy and nuclear proliferation illustrates this
                        point. We can use the connection between the two issues to find progress on
                        both: while seeking through cooperative international efforts to fire a
                        safer nuclear fuel cycle, we can use progress on development of non-nuclear
                        energy sources to reinforce our arguments against the development of unsafe
                        nuclear facilities. Conversely, we emphasize also that the dangers of
                        nuclear proliferation make the development of non-nuclear and safe nuclear
                        power all the more important.</p>
                    <p>Our reluctance to set one or two rigid conceptual doctrines—to pretend that
                        the complexities of a mature American foreign policy can be summarized in
                        one or two catch phrases—is a matter of conscious choice. We will apply
                        ourselves with more vigor to the necessity of explaining this reordering of
                        our strategies and inter-related priorities in the coming year.</p>
                    <p>Some lessons that we can draw, in the light of the last year’s experience,
                        include:</p>
                    <p>—We recognize that since we are more deeply engaged than ever in long-term
                        efforts, results may come slowly: in many areas, we do not expect dramatic
                        developments in the first year or two. We do expect to be judged on whether
                        measured progress is being achieved, however—and on how much will have been
                        achieved by the end of President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName>’s first term in office.</p>
                    <p>—The fact is that, without a single over-arching concept, we will have to
                        build a national consensus behind American foreign policy on new premises
                        and new approaches: if there is a lag in public perception of our design, it
                        is partly because many people still think in terms of bipolar diplomacy,
                        when relations with the Soviet Union dwarfed all other concerns. Now,
                        however, we must operate on a broad range of issues in a pluralistic world,
                        in which relations with the Soviet Union are central but not all
                        encompassing.</p>
                    <p>—In discussing and debating our policies, we will ask also that the press and
                        public be willing to wrestle with complexity and eschew the comfort of
                        simple slogans and a belief in quick solutions.</p>
                    <pb n="345" facs="0386" xml:id="pg_345"/>
                    <p>—Clear priorities need not be precluded by multiple goals. Certain
                        issues—because of their urgency, their importance, or both—must and do
                        receive our most serious attention. As indicated above, we place at the top
                        of our agenda for 1978 the following issues:</p>
                    <p>• Approval of the Panama Canal treaties;</p>
                    <p>• Achievement of a sound <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> treaty, and
                        other arms control measures;</p>
                    <p>• Peace-making in the Middle East and southern Africa;</p>
                    <p>• International economic recovery and development, including progress at the
                        multilateral trade negotiations and a strong American aid program;</p>
                    <p>• Energy and nuclear non-proliferation; and</p>
                    <p>• Promoting human rights.</p>
                    <p>—Abroad, we will continue to work especially closely with our alliance
                        friends in addressing these challenges.</p>
                    <p>—At home, in almost every case, progress in 1978 will be heavily dependent on
                        positive Congressional action, and close cooperation between the legislative
                        and executive branches. We welcome the role and responsibility of the
                        Congress. As we share power in an open and constitutional way with the
                        Congress, we also share responsibility with the members of both Houses to
                        address pressing issues in an expeditious and constructive fashion.</p>
                    <p>—Finally, a practical approach requires an understanding that our actions
                        need continuing examination and correction: when circumstances change (as
                        they did in the Middle East in late 1977), or when we discover that we are
                        making mistakes (as we may have done in early months, in pressing certain
                        nations to address too many of our concerns at once), it is wiser to change
                        tactics than to insist on the perfection of our approach.</p>
                    <p>In almost every case of American involvement in foreign crises, we view our
                        role as that of a facilitator, a provider of good offices. On occasion, we
                        may advance ideas or drafts, but our overriding desire is to get the parties
                        together to discuss the key issues in a meaningful way. This has been true
                        in the Middle East, in southern Africa, in the Eastern Mediterranean, in the
                        Horn of Africa and elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>By commiting our economic, diplomatic and moral resources, the chances for
                        the successful resolution of disputes are improved. But the solutions
                        themselves will depend almost always on the good will and ingenuity of the
                        parties themselves. For solutions that they have themselves designed and
                        adopted are the solutions that are most likely to endure.</p>
                    <p>On economic and other global issues, we can help to form coalitions of
                        nations working together to resolve the problems that no single nation can
                        meet alone.</p>
                    <pb n="346" facs="0387" xml:id="pg_346"/>
                    <p>We can do all this, however, only if we are willing to show leadership
                        through example as well as strength. Only through our own constructive
                        domestic and foreign policies—whether on energy or the Panama Canal—can we
                        inspire and presume to encourage other nations to act with us for the common
                        good.</p>
                    <p>As President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> said at the
                        United Nations last October,<note n="5" xml:id="d70fn5">See <ref

                    </p>
                    <p>“However wealthy and powerful the United States may be—however capable of
                        leadership—this power is increasingly relative, the leadership increasingly
                        is in need of being shared.</p>
                    <p>“No nation has a monopoly of vision, of creativity, or of ideas. Bringing
                        these together from many nations is our common responsibility and our common
                        challenge. For only in these ways can the idea of a peaceful global
                        community grow and prosper.”</p>

                    <p>At Tab A is an outline of a speech on this Administration’s defense policy
                        for your consideration.<note n="2" xml:id="d71fn2">Attached but not printed.
                            The undated, 3-page outline is entitled “Defense Policy Speech.” For the
                            text of the address as delivered by the President on March 17, see <ref

                    <p>The speech should note briefly that you conceive national security to be more
                        than military affairs and that your efforts in the non-military areas of
                        national security have been many. That must not, however, lead anyone to the
                        mistaken view that you neglect the military dimen<pb n="347" facs="0388"
                            xml:id="pg_347"/>sion of this country’s security. If we and our allies
                        seek a world of “peace without victory” while others, pretending to accept
                        that spirit of detente, actually seek “victory without war,” the world will
                        not be safe, and the military factor will become crucial. Recent Soviet
                        behavior is not reassuring on this point.</p>
                    <p>You, as Commander-in-Chief, will make clear to the American public and our
                        allies that military power is a fundamental component of national security.
                        Furthermore, a strong and rich nation cannot escape the political
                        responsibility of military power. Well-reasoned examples of this
                        Administration’s decisions on future military programs will show that you
                        carefully have considered the trends in national security affairs and are
                        providing the flexibility needed to cope with the wide range of
                        contingencies which the U.S. could face during this decade. Your personal
                        involvement in maintaining military readiness will be highlighted.</p>
                    <p>The speech would set forth the following principles:</p>
                    <p>—We do not seek military superiority but we will not allow others to attain
                        it.</p>
                    <p>—It is not our policy to intervene militarily in the domestic affairs of
                        other countries or to exacerbate regional and local conflicts, and we cannot
                        view with equanimity interventions by other powers in such conflicts.</p>
                    <p>—We shall seek arms agreements when they are possible and prudent, but we
                        shall sustain and improve our military capabilities where necessary.</p>
                    <p>—We shall be forthcoming in encouraging further economic and technological
                        cooperation with those who act to restrain destabilizing military
                        competition.</p>
                    <p>It would be easy for a number of states, not only Saudi Arabia and Iran, but
                        also Yugoslavia and our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies to
                        reach a mistaken conclusion about where we are going because we have
                        emphasized cooperation for the past year. This speech should redress the
                        balance and set the backdrop for other statements you may find important to
                        make on national security as events unfold in Africa, the Middle East, and a
                            post-<persName corresp="#p_TJB_1">Tito</persName> Yugoslavia.</p>
                    <p>In sum, the image to be conveyed is not belligerence or alarm, but rather
                        competence and confidence in the pursuit of the national strategy which you
                        set last summer.<note n="3" xml:id="d71fn3">See <ref target="#d36fn2"

                    <p>[Omitted here are the President’s introductory remarks.]</p>
                    <p>This morning I would like to talk to you about our national security—where we
                        now stand, what new circumstances we face, and what we are going to do in
                        the future.</p>
                    <p>Let me deal at the beginning with some myths. One myth is that this country
                        somehow is pulling back from protecting its interests and its friends around
                        the world. That is not the case, as will be explained in this speech and
                        demonstrated in our actions as a nation.</p>
                    <p>Another myth is that our defense budget is too burdensome and consumes an
                        undue part of our Federal revenues. National defense is, of course, a large
                        and important item of expenditures, but it represents only about 5 percent
                        of our gross national product and about a quarter of our current Federal
                        budget.</p>
                    <p>It also is a mistake to believe that our country’s defense spending is mainly
                        for intercontinental missiles or nuclear weapons. Only about 10 percent of
                        our defense budget goes for strategic forces or for nuclear deterrence. More
                        than 50 percent is simply to pay for and support the services of the men and
                        women in our Armed Forces.</p>
                    <pb n="349" facs="0390" xml:id="pg_349"/>
                    <p>Finally, some believe that because we do possess nuclear weapons of great
                        destructive power, that we need do nothing more to guarantee our Nation’s
                        security. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple.</p>
                    <p>Our potential adversaries have now built up massive forces armed with
                        conventional weapons—tanks, aircraft, infantry, mechanized units. These
                        forces could be used for political blackmail, and they could threaten our
                        vital interests unless we and our allies and friends have our own military
                        strength and conventional forces as a counterbalance.</p>
                    <p>Of course, our national security rests on more than just military power. It
                        depends partly on the productive capacity of our factories and our farms, on
                        an adequate supply of natural resources with which God has blessed us, on an
                        economic system which values human freedom above centralized control, on the
                        creative ideas of our best minds, on the hard work, cohesion, moral
                        strength, and determination of the American people, and on the friendship of
                        our neighbors to the north and south.</p>
                    <p>Our security depends on strong bonds with our allies and on whether other
                        nations seek to live in peace and refrain from trying to dominate those who
                        live around them.</p>
                    <p>But adequate and capable military forces are still an essential element of
                        our national security. We, like our ancestors, have the obligation to
                        maintain strength equal to the challenges of the world in which we live, and
                        we Americans will continue to do so.</p>
                    <p>Let us review briefly how national security issues have changed over the past
                        decade or two.</p>
                    <p>The world has grown both more complex and more interdependent. There is now a
                        division among the Communist powers. The old colonial empires have fallen,
                        and many new nations have risen in their place. Old ideological labels have
                        lost some of their meaning.</p>
                    <p>There have also been changes in the military balance among nations. Over the
                        past 20 years, the military forces of the Soviets have grown substantially,
                        both in absolute numbers and relative to our own. There also has been an
                        ominous inclination on the part of the Soviet Union to use its military
                        power—to intervene in local conflicts, with advisers, with equipment, and
                        with full logistical support and encouragement for mercenaries from other
                        Communist countries, as we can observe today in Africa.</p>
                    <p>This increase in Soviet military power has been going on for a long time.
                        Discounting inflation, since 1960 Soviet military spending has doubled,
                        rising steadily in real terms by 3 or 4 percent a year, while our own
                        military budget is actually lower now than it was in 1960.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets, who traditionally were not a significant naval power, now rank
                        number two in world naval forces.</p>
                    <pb n="350" facs="0391" xml:id="pg_350"/>
                    <p>In its balanced strategic nuclear capability, the United States retains
                        important advantages. But over the past decade, the steady Soviet buildup
                        has achieved functional equivalence in strategic forces with the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>These changes demand that we maintain adequate responses—diplomatic,
                        military, and economic—and we will.</p>
                    <p>As President and as Commander in Chief, I am responsible, along with the
                        Congress, for modernizing, expanding, and improving our Armed Forces
                        whenever our security requires it. We’ve recently completed a major
                        reassessment of our national defense strategy. And out of this process have
                        come some overall principles designed to preserve our national security
                        during the years ahead.</p>
                    <p>We will match, together with our allies and friends, any threatening power
                        through a combination of military forces, political efforts, and economic
                        programs. We will not allow any other nation to gain military superiority
                        over us.</p>
                    <p>We shall seek the cooperation of the Soviet Union and other nations in
                        reducing areas of tension. We do not desire to intervene militarily in the
                        internal domestic affairs of other countries, nor to aggravate regional
                        conflicts. And we shall oppose intervention by others.</p>
                    <p>While assuring our own military capabilities, we shall seek security through
                        dependable, verifiable arms control agreements wherever possible.</p>
                    <p>We shall use our great economic, technological, and diplomatic advantages to
                        defend our interests and to promote American values. We are prepared, for
                        instance, to cooperate with the Soviet Union toward common social,
                        scientific, and economic goals. But if they fail to demonstrate restraint in
                        missile programs and other force levels or in the projection of Soviet or
                        proxy forces into other lands and continents, then popular support in the
                        United States for such cooperation with the Soviets will certainly
                        erode.</p>
                    <p>These principles mean that, even as we search for agreement in arms control,
                        we will continue to modernize our strategic systems and to revitalize our
                        conventional forces. And I have no doubt that the Congress shares my
                        commitment in this respect.</p>
                    <p>We shall implement this policy that I’ve outlined so briefly in three
                        different ways: by maintaining strategic nuclear balance; by working closely
                        with our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies to strengthen and
                        modernize our defenses in Europe; and by maintaining and developing forces
                        to counter any threats to our allies and friends in our vital interests in
                        Asia, the Middle East, and other regions of the world.</p>
                    <p>Let me take up each of these three in turn.</p>
                    <pb n="351" facs="0392" xml:id="pg_351"/>
                    <p>Our first and most fundamental concern is to prevent nuclear war. The horrors
                        of nuclear conflict and our desire to reduce the world’s arsenals of
                        fearsome nuclear weapons do not free us from the need to analyze the
                        situation objectively and to make sensible choices about our purposes and
                        means.</p>
                    <p>Our strategic forces must be—and must be known to be—a match for the
                        capabilities of the Soviets. They will never be able to use their nuclear
                        forces to threaten, to coerce, or to blackmail us or our friends.</p>
                    <p>Our continuing major efforts in the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        talks taking place every day in Geneva are one means toward a goal of
                        strategic nuclear stability.</p>
                    <p>We and the Soviets have already reached agreement on some basic points,
                        although still others remain to be resolved. We are making good progress. We
                        are not looking for a one-sided advantage. But before I sign any <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement on behalf of the United
                        States, I will make sure that it preserves the strategic balance, that we
                        can independently verify Soviet compliance, and that we will be at least as
                        strong, relative to the Soviet Union, as we would be without any
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>But in addition to the limits and reductions of a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> II agreement, we must make other steps to protect the
                        strategic balance. During the next decade, improvements in Soviet missiles
                        can make our land-based missile forces in silos increasingly vulnerable to a
                        Soviet first strike. Such an attack would amount to national suicide for the
                        Soviet Union. But however remote, it is a threat against which we must
                        constantly be on guard.</p>
                    <p>We have a superb submarine fleet, which is relatively invulnerable to attack
                        when it’s at sea, and we have under construction new Trident submarines and
                        missiles which give our submarine ballistic missile force even greater range
                        and security.</p>
                    <p>I have ordered rapid development and deployment of cruise missiles to
                        reinforce the strategic value of our bombers. We are working on the <gloss
                            target="#t_MX_1">M–X</gloss> intercontinental ballistic missile and a
                            <gloss target="#t_Trident2_1">Trident II</gloss> submarine-launched
                        ballistic missile to give us more options to respond to Soviet strategic
                        deployments. If it becomes necessary to guarantee the clear invulnerability
                        of our strategic deterrent, I shall not hesitate to take actions for
                        full-scale deployment and development of these systems.</p>
                    <p>Our strategic defense forces, our nuclear forces, are a triad—land-based
                        missiles, sea-based missiles, and air-breathing missiles, such as bombers
                        and cruise missiles. Through the plans I’ve described, all three legs of
                        this triad will be modernized and improved. Each will retain the ability, on
                        its own, to impose devastating retaliation upon an aggressor.</p>
                    <p>For 30 years and more we’ve been committed to the defense of Europe, bound by
                        the knowledge that Western Europe’s security is vital <pb n="352"
                            facs="0393" xml:id="pg_352"/>to our own. We continue to cooperate with
                        our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Allies in a strategy for flexible
                        response, combining conventional forces and nuclear forces so that no
                        aggressor can threaten the territory of Europe or its freedom, which in the
                        past we have fought together to defend.</p>
                    <p>For several years we and our allies have been trying to negotiate mutual and
                        balanced reduction in military forces in Europe with the Soviets and with
                        the Warsaw Pact nations who are their allies. But in the meantime, the
                        Soviets have continued to increase and to modernize their forces beyond a
                        level necessary for defense. In the face of this excessive Soviet buildup,
                        we and our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Allies have had to take
                        important steps to cope with short-term vulnerabilities and to respond to
                        long-term threats. We are significantly strengthening U.S. forces stationed
                        in Western Europe and improving our ability to speed additional ground and
                        air forces to the defense of Europe in a time of crisis.</p>
                    <p>Our European allies, who supply the major portion of <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s conventional combat strength, are also
                        improving their readiness and their reinforcement capabilities and their
                        antitank defenses. The heads of the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        governments will be here in our country attending a summit meeting in

                        defense program which will expand and integrate more closely allied defense
                        plans.</p>
                    <p>For many years, the United States has been a major world power. Our
                        longstanding concerns encompass our own security interests and those of our
                        allies and friends far beyond our own shores and Europe.</p>
                    <p>We have important historical responsibilities to enhance peace in East Asia,
                        in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf, and throughout our own hemisphere.
                        Our preference in all these areas is to turn first to international
                        agreements that reduce the overall level of arms and minimize the threat of
                        conflict. But we have the will, and we will also maintain the capacity, to
                        honor our commitments and to protect our interests in those critical
                        areas.</p>
                    <p>In the Pacific, our effective security is enhanced by mutual defense treaties
                        with our allies and by our friendship and cooperation with other Pacific
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>Japan and South Korea, closely linked with the United States, are located
                        geographically where vital interests of great powers converge. It is
                        imperative that Northeast Asia remain stable. We will maintain and even
                        enhance our military strength in this area, improving our air <pb n="353"
                            facs="0394" xml:id="pg_353"/>strength and reducing our ground forces, as
                        the South Korean army continues to modernize and to increase its own
                        capabilities.</p>
                    <p>In the Middle East and the region of the Indian Ocean, we seek permanent
                        peace and stability. The economic health and well-being of the United
                        States, Western Europe, Japan, depend upon continued access to the oil from
                        the Persian Gulf area.</p>
                    <p>In all these situations, the primary responsibility for preserving peace and
                        military stability rests with the countries of the region. But we shall
                        continue to work with our friends and allies to strengthen their ability to
                        prevent threats to their interests and to ours.</p>
                    <p>In addition, however, we will maintain forces of our own which can be called
                        upon, if necessary, to support mutual defense efforts. The Secretary of
                        Defense, at my direction, is improving and will maintain quickly deployable
                        forces—air, land, and sea—to defend our interests throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>Arms control agreements are a major goal as instruments of our national
                        security, but this will be possible only if we maintain appropriate military
                        force levels. Reaching balanced, verifiable agreements with our adversaries
                        can limit the cost of security and reduce the risk of war. But even then, we
                        must—and we will—proceed efficiently with whatever arms programs our own
                        security requires.</p>
                    <p>When I leave this auditorium, I shall be going to visit with the crew aboard
                        one of our most modern nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in the Atlantic
                            Ocean.<note n="3" xml:id="d72fn3">In his diary entry for March 17, the

                            the impressiveness of the display, I don’t believe we need to build
                            another nuclear carrier, which costs about $2.5 billion and enormous
                            quantities of money to operate.” (<hi rend="italic">White House

                        through strength, combat will be prevented. We as Americans will always
                        support them in their courageous vigil.</p>
                    <p>This has been a serious and a sober talk, but there is no cause for
                        pessimism. We face a challenge, and we will do whatever is necessary to meet
                        it. We will preserve and protect our country and continue to promote and to
                        maintain peace around the world. This means that we shall have to continue
                        to support strong and efficient military forces.</p>
                    <p>For most of human history, people have wished vainly that freedom and the
                        flowering of the human spirit, which freedom nourishes, did not finally have
                        to depend upon the force of arms. We, like <pb n="354" facs="0395"
                            xml:id="pg_354"/>our forebears, live in a time when those who would
                        destroy liberty are restrained less by their respect for freedom itself than
                        by their knowledge that those of us who cherish freedom are strong.</p>
                    <p>We are a great nation made up of talented people. We can readily afford the
                        necessary costs of our military forces, as well as an increased level, if
                        needed, to prevent any adversary from destabilizing the peace of the world.
                        The money we spend on defense is not wasted any more than is the cost of
                        maintaining a police force in a local community to keep the peace. This
                        investment purchases our freedom to fulfill the worthy goals of our
                        Nation.</p>
                    <p>Southerners, whose ancestors a hundred years ago knew the horrors of a
                        homeland devastated by war, are particularly determined that war shall never
                        come to us again. All Americans understand the basic lesson of history: that
                        we need to be resolute and able to protect ourselves, to prevent threats and
                        domination by others.</p>
                    <p>No matter how peaceful and secure and easy the circumstances of our lives now
                        seem, we have no guarantee that the blessings will endure. That is why we
                        will always maintain the strength which, God willing, we shall never need to
                        use.</p>

                    <p>To achieve your foreign policy objectives—a more peaceful world based on a
                        reduction of arms, a deeper understanding with the Soviet Union, and
                        restraint and the resolution of conflicts in the third world—it will take
                        more than simply negotiating each of these matters in their isolation and in

                        public at large.</p>
                    <p>It is clearly in the Soviet interest, and part of the Soviet strategy, to
                        focus attention on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, and to proclaim
                        the agreement to be evidence of a general improvement in <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Soviet relations. This then leaves the
                        Soviets free to pursue their political objectives elsewhere and by other
                        means.</p>
                    <p>In addition to <hi rend="italic">negotiating</hi>, with an agreement being
                        clearly also in the U.S. interest, it is therefore imperative that the U.S.
                        focus also on the larger dimensions of the U.S.-Soviet relationship. Indeed,
                        the U.S. side should open the discussions with a broad review of the
                        relationship, emphasizing that we seek a detente that is <hi rend="italic"
                            >increasingly comprehensive and genuinely reciprocal</hi>. Unless we do
                        that, we enable the Soviets to set the tone and to define the priorities of
                        the U.S.-Soviet relationship, clearly to their own advantage. Moreover, I am
                        quite convinced that unless detente becomes comprehensive and reciprocal, we
                        will face an increasing rebellion at home, and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"

                    <p>I think it is not unfair to summarize the Soviet strategy as involving the
                        following elements:</p>
                    <p>1. Keep movement going forward on detente in the area of arms control
                        relationships. This both restrains any U.S. build-up, and generates a more
                        passive U.S. attitude on other issues;<note n="3" xml:id="d73fn3">The

                    </p>
                    <p>2. Create the impression of a special U.S.-Soviet relationship, which

                    <p>6. To intimidate the U.S. and its allies by massive propaganda campaigns,
                        such as the one directed at the neutron bomb, and through general

                        self-examination. We no longer seem to enjoy the grandeur of simplicity in
                        our foreign policy. Our goals seem more distant and unattainable; our
                        resources inadequate; our people fed up; our gov<pb n="359" facs="0400"
                            xml:id="pg_359"/>ernment divided; our friends uncertain. There seems a
                        diffusion of power everywhere. We find no accepted poles of authority, no
                        widely shared principles of action.</p>
                    <p>If <persName corresp="#p_ADG_1">Dean Acheson</persName> was present at the
                        creation, where are we? We are at a stage which marks the “greening of
                        American diplomacy.”<note n="3" xml:id="d74fn3">Presumably <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCW_1">Maynes</persName> based this phrase on Charles
                            Reich’s <hi rend="italic">The Greening of America</hi> (New York: Random
                            House, 1970). In it, Reich heralded the development of the
                            counterculture in the 1960s, noting that the organizational society of
                            the early postwar era had given way to a more egalitarian
                            society.</note> We are witnessing its democratization and final
                        maturity.</p>
                    <p>For a century and more, this country enjoyed the luxury of ignoring the rest
                        of the world. Geography provided the basis of our foreign policy, and
                        isolation from foreign crises was the result.</p>
                    <p>At the end of World War II we moved to a new stage. We began, fitfully, to
                        apply our growing national power to the world stage. Overwhelming and almost
                        unchallengeable national power provided the basis of our foreign policy, and
                        intervention and involvement in several foreign crises were the result.</p>
                    <p>Now we are entering a third stage in our diplomatic development. We are
                        attempting, again fitfully, to adjust to the new power of others while
                        trying to maintain or enhance our own. The result is a challenge to this
                        country of a unique sort, for we are being asked for the first time to
                        practice diplomacy as other nations have always been forced to practice it.
                        Like other nations we are finding that our foreign policy goals are at least
                        as likely to be attained because of the subtlety of our approach as through
                        the morality of our cause or the strength of our military and economy. We
                        can no longer order so we have to practice the art of persuading others.</p>
                    <p>What does all this mean in practice? In the period following the Second World
                        War, American power rose to unprecedented heights. With the rest of the
                        world in ruins, the United States accounted for 60% of the world’s
                        industrial production, 50% of its military spending, and a commanding share
                        of its monetary reserves. Some call this period the “golden age of American
                        diplomacy.” But the phrase is not at all appropriate. It was not a golden
                        age of American diplomacy but an exhilarating age of American governance.
                        The task of American foreign policy then lay primarily in deciding among
                        ourselves what to do, much less in deciding how to persuade others to do it
                        with us. Other friends, given their weakness, had little choice. In that
                        period, America achieved an influence over the entire globe—its politics,
                        its economics, its culture—that had never been seen before and probably will
                        never be seen again.</p>
                    <pb n="360" facs="0401" xml:id="pg_360"/>
                    <p>Yet despite the passing of that age, we also in a sense can feel “present at
                        the creation,” for changing world realities are creating a whole new
                        tradition and environment for American diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>There are several paradoxical aspects of this development that deserve
                        examination, and I would like to turn to them now.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Nationalism and Interdependence</p>
                    <p>The diffusion of power internationally and the accelerated development of a
                        global economy have radically changed the international environment. The
                        code word for this is interdependence, a reality that requires a different
                        approach to diplomacy, that presupposes, on the part of the American foreign
                        policy establishment and the public, a more nuanced understanding of
                        international political realities. Yet habits are hard to break, and a clash
                        between reality and perception continues to hamper our efforts.</p>
                    <p>The most ready example of this is our national struggle to come to grips with
                        the opportunities and risks of detente. But another more telling example is
                        our persistent misunderstanding of the politics and importance of the
                        nonaligned nations. Linked to this is our deep resentment of this effort to
                        pursue aggressively their interests as though such a cause of action was
                        permitted only for the developed countries. It is ironic that our most
                        enthusiastic flagwavers and manipulators of nationalistic symbols are
                        invariably incapable of understanding similar feelings among others.</p>
                    <p>The debate over the Panama Canal treaties is a case in point. The canal may
                        have had strategic importance to us in the past, and it may still be of
                        vital interest to us as a free and open waterway. But we could hardly
                        maintain that its military importance is the same in an age of ballistic
                        missiles and nuclear submarines as it was 30 years ago. Moreover, we have no
                        exclusive claims to vital interests there, as these interests are shared by
                        the Panamanians, the other South American countries, as well as the rest of
                        the world. Yet the entire Panama Canal debate tells us something about
                        ourselves and the forces that move nations in 1978. The careful calculation
                        of national interest and of net advantage—the essence of traditional
                        diplomacy—was nearly swamped in the emotional and unpredictable national
                        reaction to the canal treaties. We were fortunate that we had people in the
                        Senate who displayed real political courage.</p>
                    <p>A segment of our public’s reaction to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName>’s recent overseas tours to developing countries is
                        another good example of our lingering tension between national bias and
                        international reality.<note n="4" xml:id="d74fn4">Presumable reference is to
                            the President’s trips to Venezuela March 28–29, Brazil March 29–31, and
                            Nigeria and Liberia March 31–April 3.</note>
                        <pb n="361" facs="0402" xml:id="pg_361"/>Ritualistically the press denounced
                        the trips as without purpose or focus. Three decades of habitual summitry
                        had given us, what one might call an acute case of “Eurovision.” This view
                        accepts as a matter of course our President’s dealing with heads of state in
                        Paris, Moscow, or London, or for that matter any capital in Europe. Yet it
                        becomes bewildered, bemused, or cynical when he is welcomed in Rio, Lagos,
                        or New Delhi. Minds close and eyes glaze when it is explained that India is
                        the 10th industrial power in the world as well as the globe’s largest
                        democracy, that we conduct more trade with Nigeria than South Africa, or
                        that Brazil is on the way to a global as well as regional role.</p>
                    <p>This “Eurovision” perceives the non-Western world only as a ragtag collection
                        of nonviable ministates, a concern of the Peace Corps, missionaries, and
                        readers of the <hi rend="italic">National Geographic</hi>. Yet the facts are
                        these.</p>
                    <p>• U.S. exports to the less developed countries, exclusive of the members of
                        the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, constituted about
                        one-fourth of the total U.S. exports in the past 2 years, approximately
                        equaling what we export to East and West Europe, to the Soviet Union, and to
                        China.</p>
                    <p>• Close to one-half of our imports—about $60 billion—originate in the Third
                        World, including more than 9 out of 13 critical minerals.</p>
                    <p>• Since the early 1970’s, when our dependence on foreign oil began to
                        challenge our complacent perceptions, we have in fact increased our oil
                        imports by eight times and are close to importing one-half of our total oil
                        consumption.</p>
                    <p>• Countries like India, Brazil, Nigeria, Iran, and Saudi Arabia play a role
                        on the world stage that dwarfs that of some of the countries we
                        traditionally consider “critical.”</p>
                    <p>These realities underline an essential fact—the health and progress of
                        American society are vitally linked to the economic and political stability
                        of the Southern Hemisphere. Yet whether we have the maturity to understand
                        that point remains very much in doubt at present.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">International Institutions</p>
                    <p>International institutions are another example of how America’s perceptions
                        are not always synchronized with changing realities. America was principally
                        responsible for the creation of the current family of international
                        institutions. Their creation seemed a few years ago one of the most
                        imaginative ideas ever put into practice. Yet increasingly, we see it
                        suggested that these institutions are a nice place to visit, but one
                        wouldn’t want to conduct his diplomacy there.</p>
                    <p>Since the mid-1960’s, however, international institutions have changed
                        enormously without many understanding the transformation. Look at the
                        budgets. In the beginning, expenditures of the U.N. system <pb n="362"
                            facs="0403" xml:id="pg_362"/>were only about $200 million a year, and
                        they were basically for operating expenses. Now the budget of the U.N.
                        system, excluding the development banks, exceeds $2.5 billion per year, and
                        the organization is active not only in four major peacekeeping operations
                        but also is devoting more than 90% of its budget to economic and social
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>At our urging the United Nations has entered such fields as technical
                        assistance, environment, population, and drug control. With this new scope
                        and with new resources—with several key countries, in addition, using the
                        U.N. system as a channel for their development assistance—the United Nations
                        has assumed unprecedented significance.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, the World Bank has become a much more important vehicle for
                        development assistance than the U.S. aid program (which tends to be focused
                        on a few swing countries in sensitive regions of the world). Indeed, a major
                        triumph of U.S. diplomacy has been success in using international
                        institutions to persuade other countries to assume a major share of the
                        burden of global development efforts. Only a few years ago our share was
                        around 40%; now it is closer to 20%.</p>
                    <p>Yet today international institutions are under unprecedented attack—an attack
                        much more dangerous than some of the rhetorical assaults we have witnessed
                        in the past. There are efforts to place totally unworkable restrictions on
                        our contributions to international institutions.</p>
                    <p>If these efforts succeed, no international agency will, for example, be able
                        to assist any government to increase production of certain products whose
                        potential export might at some future date be competitive with American
                        producers. We are asked, as World Bank President <persName
                            corresp="#p_MRS_1">Robert McNamara</persName> has pointed out, to deny
                        Papua New Guinea the right to increase palm oil production on the theory
                        that this might be competitive with our soybean production when, in fact,
                        our troubles—if we at some point have any—will stem from soybean production
                        in Brazil; and this is the result of investments from a Japan still shocked
                        by our decision in 1973 to ban soya exports to Japan in order to hold down
                        prices here.<note n="5" xml:id="d74fn5">See <ref target="#d2fn3">footnote 3,

                    </p>
                    <p>At the same time, popular rhetoric continues to denounce the domination of
                        the United Nations by ministates; yet anyone with knowledge of international
                        organizations knows that the true influence is exerted by countries of
                        growing power and influence—countries such as Algeria, Brazil, Egypt, India,
                        Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tanzania, and Yugoslavia. By
                        the end of this century, it is expected that the top 12 countries in the
                        world in terms of population will not include a single Western power except
                        the United States. The <pb n="363" facs="0404" xml:id="pg_363"/>Third World
                        now represents 74% of the world’s people; it has 58% of the world’s armed
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>The reasons behind this Administration’s decision to devote a new degree of
                        attention to the United Nations then are not trivial or the result of
                            <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Andy Young</persName>’s [U.S. Ambassador to
                        the United Nations] personal views. The U.N. system is the essential element
                        for the conduct of foreign relations by most of the Third World countries.
                        It is the collective source of much of their diplomatic influence, the basic
                        outlet for their foreign relations initiatives. As we come to comprehend
                        better the importance of these countries to us, we realize the necessity of
                        dealing with them through international organizations. In short, the
                        perception of the U.N. system as a nice but essentially meaningless
                        institution should end. It does not match the reality of 1978.</p>
                    <p>This greater interest in international institutions is laying the groundwork
                        for addressing many of the more important issues on the international
                        agenda—issues which can only be effectively handled in the multilateral
                        context. The catalogue is almost endless: energy, population, food, health,
                        pollution, money supply, economic growth, human rights, narcotics control,
                        arms sales, nuclear proliferation, outer space, the deep seabed. Yet we face
                        this paradox. In the past we praised international institutions and tended
                        not to use them. Now we use them and tend not to praise them. How long can
                        this continue without undermining the instruments we need?</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Human Rights: Religion or Foreign Policy?</p>
                    <p>A renewed emphasis on human rights is a major new trend in American foreign
                        policy, strongly supported by the American people. It is more than posturing
                        toward foreigners as it expresses the essential values of our society. It is
                        more than just another factor grafted on our diplomatic efforts to be
                        evaluated by simple input-output analyses. Yet it is here where we encounter
                        an enormous controversy with cries of success and failure sometimes uttered
                        by the same person. How does one measure success in this endeavor? We might
                        suggest two possibilities.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> if one views the human rights issue as a
                        religious campaign, then one is almost never satisfied because, regardless
                        of the progress made, one will always see more to do. The danger of such an
                        approach is that the opponents of human rights will begin to argue that
                        unless the same degree of success can be attained everywhere, the whole
                        effort should be abandoned.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Second,</hi> if the human rights effort is viewed from a
                        more traditional foreign policy point of view, then the foremost “success”
                        of our human rights policy lies in the undeniable fact that human rights
                        have become a global issue and are decreasingly an exclusive domain of
                        American <pb n="364" facs="0405" xml:id="pg_364"/>concern. This is a
                        major—and we should hope not short run—change in international practice.</p>
                    <p>The recently concluded meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission provides
                        an example of what I mean.<note n="6" xml:id="d74fn6">The 34th <gloss

                        one of the most successful in a decade. More important, it provided evidence
                        that African and Asian countries are assuming a leadership role in an area
                        where many in this country believe that only we care. For the first time in
                        U.N. history, the Commission took action under its 1503 procedures<note

                        Equatorial Guinea, and a number of other countries. The credit for this
                        development lies more in a growing international consciousness than in any
                        efforts by the United States.</p>
                    <p>Yet at this point it is unclear whether this country has the patience to
                        build the kind of international consensus on human rights that will make the
                        subject a central issue of international diplomacy. Recalling an influence
                        we no longer enjoy, we may overlook a collective success we stand some
                        chance of achieving.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Foreign Policy Design and Domestic Demands</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the most striking aspect of this new age of diplomacy is its field of
                        practice. We have entered an age of democratic diplomacy which is
                        revolutionizing the craft. It used to be said that foreign policy had only a
                        small constituency. But who can say that today? The constituency is growing
                        every day; the problem is that it is not of one mind and too often it is
                        angry.</p>
                    <p>For decades our leaders have argued that to accomplish a political task, one
                        must organize. I think it is safe to say Americans have learned how. The
                        civil rights, consumer, and antiwar movements have provided on-the-job
                        training to all of us. As a result, on a growing number of issues, foreign
                        policy appears to be losing its earlier character as a largely autonomous
                        sphere of action and thought. Foreign policy is becoming more inextricably
                        linked to domestic politics and policy.</p>
                    <p>In the postwar period, we should recall, the two realms were not so closely
                        linked.</p>
                    <p>• It was only recently that the dependence of the United States on certain
                        raw materials reached the point that shifts in the terms of trade or
                        embargoes could have a radical effect on our domestic economy.</p>
                    <pb n="365" facs="0406" xml:id="pg_365"/>
                    <p>• It was only in the 1960’s that the rise of the multinational corporations
                        changed the policy focus of large U.S. firms so that today up to 30% of
                        total U.S. corporate profits can be attributed to overseas operations.</p>
                    <p>• It was also only in a recent period that our allies and some of the more
                        successful developing countries began to compete directly with American
                        industry in our internal market whereas before there was little that
                        American business or labor had to fear.</p>
                    <p>We can also look for another reason why foreign affairs and domestic affairs
                        are becoming linked. In the past the domestic burden of foreign policy
                        usually increased in the event of a foreign policy failure as when diplomacy
                        ended and war began. Thus, the domestic burden of our foreign policy
                        increased sharply during the Korean and Vietnam wars; as the burden
                        increased, so did political division at home.</p>
                    <p>Today, these burdens seem to increase not only in the case of a foreign
                        policy failure but in the event of a foreign policy “success.” An arms
                        control agreement may result in sharply increased defense expenditures as we
                        are urged to redouble our efforts in areas not covered by the new compact or
                        as we build costly verification equipment. A successful international energy
                        policy may require drastic domestic reforms to succeed. An economic
                        agreement may further shift the terms of trade against American business. In
                        all three cases what might legitimately represent a diplomatic triumph, far
                        from easing domestic burdens, could actually increase them.</p>
                    <p>As a result, today when some foreign policy issue begins to shape, it is not
                        just a few foreigners or key Senators who express the same view. Today’s
                        State Department official can rest assured that he will hear from others.
                        The very first may be his mother, who wants him to cut out whatever he is
                        doing. Then he will take a phone call from a Senator who never before had
                        taken an interest in the subject, then a letter from an irate American
                        Legion member. His press officer will ask guidance to answer questions from
                        the Associated Press. His former colleagues—either from Brookings or from
                        the American Enterprise Institute, depending on their politics—will pay a
                        friendly visit to express their views. Then a congressional hearing on the
                        topic will feature distinguished citizens, including former officials of the
                        State Department, leaders of nongovernmental organizations, and academic
                        experts. Editorials will spring up like mushrooms in the New York <hi
                            rend="italic">Times,</hi> the Washington <hi rend="italic">Post,</hi>
                        and, of course, the Atlanta <hi rend="italic">Constitution.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Computerized letterwriting is a new development, the side product of the
                        political campaigns of 1972 and 1976. It can produce hundreds of thousands
                        of identical letters from all over the country, as we have seen in the case
                        of the Panama Canal. The State Department, in turn, is providing
                        computerized replies. Because the pressures are so <pb n="366" facs="0407"
                            xml:id="pg_366"/>great and on so many issues, the practitioners of
                        foreign policy today require communications and political skills which
                        yesterday were less critical. This may be an overlooked reason for the
                        growing role of the White House in foreign affairs. It is not a power grab
                        away from the State Department but an effort to provide “technical
                        assistance.”</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A Vision for a Complex World</p>
                    <p>We live in an age of “all-at-once-ness”—in time and place. Good or bad news
                        that used to take days or even months to travel now bombard our nervous
                        systems incessantly and simultaneously. There is no recovery time in our
                        body politic; no time for recuperation and regeneration; no time to absorb
                        and reflect on what has occurred and how we reacted before new,
                        unanticipated events propel us to divert attention from one crisis to
                        another. The pace, the crazy rhythm of events, magnified by their immediate
                        impact, deprive us all of even the luxury of pause and reflection. When, we
                        might ask, have the contemporary George Kennans got time for thoughtful
                        meditation to fuse a profound understanding of history with a professional
                        ability at prediction?</p>
                    <p>There is one feature of the international system from which we can derive
                        both hope and concern. It is what one might almost call the homeostasis of
                        world diplomacy. Homeostasis, in case you have forgotten, is the almost
                        miraculous self-adjusting property of a system to maintain its stability by
                        a coordinated response of its parts to any stimuli that tend to disturb
                        it.</p>
                    <p>In simple words, our international system may have become so complex, so
                        interrelated, and so unfathomable that its very complexity seems to keep it
                        out of harm’s way and leaves in total confusion and ignorance not only those
                        who attempt to reform it but, fortunately, those too who would try to do it
                        in. On the other hand, the system is hardly without defects, and its plastic
                        character make it difficult to undertake reform. Precisely because the
                        enterprise is so difficult, only a collective effort can succeed—which means
                        a more vigorous and engaged diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>In this effort, words remain the sharpest tool of attack and, when in
                        trouble, the last line of defense. But American diplomats have no monopoly
                        on the definition of words; and the impact of words is so much greater and
                        more unpredictable in our age of participatory diplomacy. We are all
                        vulnerable to the dictionary guerrillas who do not necessarily battle for
                        the clarity of thought.</p>
                    <p>Rather, they twist and bend the meaning of terms to fit and serve their
                        self-serving interpretation, their particular cause. Hence, the struggle in
                        debate here, in international conferences abroad, and in negotiations about
                        such terms as “human rights,” “basic human needs,” “the new international
                        economic order,” and a host of other currently <pb n="367" facs="0408"
                            xml:id="pg_367"/>topical expressions such as “Palestinian homeland,”
                        “internal settlement” and so on and so on.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, words remain important. They convey ideas, and ideas confer
                        power. That is the essence of diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>Some of the more practical in our society might argue that power devolves
                        more from military strength, economic capacity, and technological
                        superiority and that those factors are what enable us to get what we want as
                        we deal with the rest of the world. That may have been the ultimate argument
                        in the age of Bismarck, but I submit that it is neither practical nor in our
                        long-term interest to rely exclusively or excessively on that kind of power
                        today. In today’s world insufficient power comes out of the barrel of a
                        rifle, or the smokestacks of Pittsburgh.</p>
                    <p>No, to the contrary, our influence rests more upon our vision, our ideals,
                        and—yes—our words. The real question is how much our vision reflects the
                        concerns and interests of the community of nations—a community of which we
                        are a part but no longer the proprietor.</p>
                    <p>What we require in 1978 is a vision that is clear enough to be understood by
                        others, flexible enough to take into account the constant changes in world
                        society, strong enough to guide our diplomacy, and worthy enough to be
                        supported by our people.</p>
                    <p>Such a vision will have to be developed with the cooperation of many parties.
                        But the building blocks are obvious:</p>
                    <p>• The vision must address the issues of world security from a larger
                        viewpoint than narrow nationalism can provide.</p>
                    <p>• The vision must address the issues of American welfare from a framework of
                        improving the welfare of the international community as a whole.</p>
                    <p>• The vision must serve to strengthen international institutions and
                        procedures that help more rationally to share power <hi rend="italic"
                            >and</hi> responsibility.</p>
                    <p>• The vision must embrace human rights in their broadest meaning which
                        involves a commitment to the dignity of human beings in the material and
                        political sense.</p>
                    <p>Always, we will need to back up our vision and our words with resources and
                        action. Even then, we will not always get what we want. But there is no
                        alternative. The dynamics of our society and of world affairs do not permit
                        us either to go on our way or to have our own way. We live in a
                        participatory age, and frankly, I think, we shouldn’t want it any other
                        way.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> indicates that he took
                            notes during the retreat for subsequent dictation. (p. 185) During the
                            discussions, <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> explained
                            the genesis of the retreat: “I wanted you here because I could see a
                            deterioration of our esteem in the public eye, and I don’t disagree with
                            the public. What has bothered me is a lack of cohesion and team spirit,
                            which is almost inevitable. We have a damn good administration, a fine
                            cabinet, a good staff. I wish you knew each other as well as I know
                            you.” (ibid., p. 188) <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"

                            1978.</note> Below I outline some observations which I hope will be of
                        some value in determining how we should proceed from here:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Speeches</p>
                    <p>My most basic recommendation is that you should dramatically increase the
                        degree to which you emphasize the public education role of your presidency.
                        In retrospect, I believe that this function has been seriously
                        under-emphasized and that the Administration’s efforts have suffered as a
                        result.</p>
                    <p>Where you have given major speeches—such as those at Notre Dame, Charleston,
                        Wake Forest and <gloss target="#t_ASNE_1">ASNE</gloss>—they have served as
                        useful basic charters which have provided the comprehensive factual and
                        philosophical framework of a particular policy to experts and editorialists,
                        to our allies and adversaries, and especially to the public.<note n="3"

                            President’s April 11 remarks before the American Society of Newspaper
                            Editors, which were broadcast live on television and radio. For the text
                            of his remarks, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName

                            721–727.</note> Each of these speeches has been enormously valuable.</p>
                    <p>I propose that you undertake a much heavier speaking schedule, not only in
                        Washington but around the country, on issues of greatest <pb n="369"
                            facs="0410" xml:id="pg_369"/>importance to your Administration. Such a
                        schedule will provide opportunities for comprehensive articulation of the
                        basic philosophy and direction of your Administration. You could focus on a
                        series of issues, spelling out to the American people where you’re going,
                        how you intend to get there, and what kinds of problems you see in the
                        way.</p>
                    <p>I suggest you put Stu <persName corresp="#p_ESE_1">Eizenstat</persName> in
                        charge of a small task force, which would work closely with Jody, to map out
                        a long-term public speaking strategy. It would recommend forums for and
                        prepare speeches on such matters as government reorganization and
                        responsiveness, the economy, education and the environment. The series might
                        appropriately begin with a speech on the difficulties of grappling with many
                        of today’s difficult problems, emphasizing that you became President in
                        order to tackle tough issues such as government reorganization, health care,
                        tax reform, illegal immigration, social security financing, Panama Canal,
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, and others which have been
                        festering for years but which cannot be ignored.</p>
                    <p>I have sensed a much greater disposition on your part to articulate
                        comprehensively your positions on foreign policy than those in the domestic
                        area. I sense you are reluctant to define your own approach and philosophy
                        regarding domestic issues. I may be wrong, but I sense that when you feel
                        you are being characterized as being too liberal, you react in a way
                        designed to counteract that definition; similarly, when you are being
                        characterized as too conservative, you react in the opposite way.</p>
                    <p>In short, I have the impression that you intensely dislike being defined or
                        “labeled”. That may have some value, but I fear it also contributes to the
                        feeling that people don’t know you, they can’t feel you, they don’t know
                        where you are going. I believe that by giving more major speeches, you will
                        not only perform your public education role but it will require those of us
                        serving you to help define and describe the Administration’s goals more
                        effectively than we do now. Also, these speeches hopefully will become the
                        documents on which the next election is fought.</p>
                    <p>I believe a lot of work has to be put into your speeches. If Stu mapped out a
                        long-range schedule, we would have more lead-time to prepare them and could
                        make better use of thoughtful outsiders. Most of your speeches tend to be
                        descriptive and detailed demonstrations of what you know and the amount of
                        work that went into a particular decision; but at the same time they tend to
                        be, for many listeners, fairly heavy and incomprehensible, lacking the
                        eloquence and persuasiveness that a Presidential address should possess. I
                        would hope a good deal of thought could be put into how we can make these
                        speeches more persuasive and eloquent.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Public Perceptions of Your Presidential
                        Leadership</p>
                    <p>Your critics make many charges directed at your leadership, including the
                        following:</p>
                    <p>• You are allegedly weak, uncertain and indecisive. They point to the absence
                        of vetoes and attempt to make your views appear to be uncertain, equivocal
                        and subject to bending under pressure. There have been no public displays of
                        anger. Your efforts to de-imperialize the Presidency have resulted in
                        diminishing the awe of the office.</p>
                    <p>• That you are preoccupied with foreign affairs;</p>
                    <p>• That you live a cloistered and private life and that you don’t really enjoy
                        the company of others in informal settings;</p>
                    <p>• That you are a manager and not a leader;</p>
                    <p>• That you become overwhelmed by minutiae;</p>
                    <p>• That your staff tends to be limited, at least in terms of Washington
                        experience, and that you are not getting sufficient advice from persons of
                        stature and experience other than the original friends you brought from
                        Georgia.</p>
                    <p>I find very few people ever arguing that you’re not bright, honest, decent or
                        hard-working; rather, they argue that you are ineffective.</p>
                    <p>The great potential and exciting opportunity of this public perception is
                        that, in most instances, it is inaccurate and can be quickly remedied by
                        simply letting the public see more clearly what those of us who work with
                        you see daily. This argues that you should undertake the much stronger
                        public education role outlined above. It argues for some vetoes and/or
                        strong rhetoric. It argues for strong discipline of disloyal persons to
                        reverse the present complete lack of fear that anyone will pay a price—any
                        prices—for unauthorized leaks or damaging statements. (As <persName
                            corresp="#p_SRS_2">Strauss</persName> puts it, “There is no penalty for
                        screwing up in this Administration.”) It argues for the political engagement
                        of your cabinet officers in an effort to serve your broadest goals. It
                        argues for other steps that demonstrate visibly the strength of your
                        leadership. Finally, I think we should look for proper ways for you to
                        perform that will enable people to “look up” to your office without
                        returning to the <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> imperial
                        presidency.</p>
                    <p>I believe the “indecisive” issue is due largely to leaks which purport to
                        show uncertainty when, in fact, it is an essential part of the
                        decision-making process to hear different views. If we can start plugging
                        most of these leaks, I think we’ll be hearing much less of this
                        criticism.</p>
                    <p>I fear there is a good deal of validity to the argument that you spend too
                        much time poring over staff memos in your office, and not enough time in
                        public giving speeches and appearing with people. As someone said, when we
                        elect a President, we don’t want a manager. We can hire them. We want a
                        leader.</p>
                    <pb n="371" facs="0412" xml:id="pg_371"/>
                    <p>Your perceptions, philosophies and objectives for America can be explained
                        only in the public role. I think you do too little of it. If there’s one
                        element of your Presidency that cries out for correction, in my judgment,
                        that is it.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Limited Range of Advice</p>
                    <p>I know you get all kinds of advice, but I’m afraid that much of it comes in a
                        way that is not always helpful. I think you should have informal
                        meetings—perhaps bi-weekly—with some of the wise and experienced people in
                        this town and elsewhere, people who want nothing from you and who have no
                        axes to grind. Getting together periodically with small groups of these
                        people—preferably in the evening, away from the press and off the
                        record—could be invaluable.</p>
                    <p>I can think of people who would be candid with you in such meetings, who
                        would not talk about them afterwards, and with whom you could try out new
                        thoughts and ideas. Several who come to mind are <persName

                        there are others. Nearly anyone you wanted would be very flattered to be
                        asked and very willing to help.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Foreign Policy</p>
                    <p>I think there has been inadequate strategic political thinking in the
                        development of our foreign policy. Most of our foreign policy initiatives do
                        not enjoy the same kind of congressional and political appraisal when they
                        are being developed that their domestic counterparts do. You tend to get too
                        personally identified with foreign policy initiatives whose chances of
                        success are slight. I can think of many such instances with which the
                        Secretary of State is closely and personally identified, and others with
                        which you are as well.</p>
                    <p>I have long sensed an attitude among the foreign policy advisers that there
                        is something suspect about looking at a foreign policy problem in the
                        context of the political environment in which it must be fought. I couldn’t
                        disagree more profoundly with this attitude, and I think we must do
                        everything possible to reverse it.</p>
                    <p>I don’t believe, for example, that the option you finally selected on the
                        neutron bomb issue—which I think is a good one—ever appeared in the options
                        paper given you. Rather, the paper simply dealt with absolutes and it was
                        only after a broader public debate that the option that you ultimately
                        settled on emerged as the sensible answer.</p>
                    <p>Also, I think you get too personally and too deeply involved in too many
                        minor foreign issues. I have talked repeatedly about the number of foreign
                        visitors. But it is hard to think of any issue—whether it is Belize, Cyprus
                        or Namibia—in which you don’t become deeply im<pb n="372" facs="0413"
                            xml:id="pg_372"/>mersed once you learn of it. I realize that seeing
                        foreign visitors and working on foreign problems is important, but I think
                        we need a better balance.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">My Role</p>
                    <p>I believe I should also make a basic re-evaluation of the ways in which I
                        have been serving you. In reviewing the last few months, I have concluded
                        that I have been spending too much time on routine work which parallels and
                        often duplicates the efforts of others and which they could do just as well
                        on their own; at the same time I have not been doing those things that
                        others cannot do. I have in mind such things as the western trip, which
                        produced more benefits for the Administration than I expected.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d75fn4">Presumable reference to <persName corresp="#p_MWF_1"
                                >Mondale</persName>’s January 10–13 trip to New Mexico, Utah,
                            Colorado, Montana, Washington, Idaho, and Nevada.</note> It put the
                        problems in focus and identified where we should be concentrating our
                        efforts, which before the trip had been diffuse and uncoordinated. I have
                        been told that there has been a substantial improvement in western attitudes
                        towards us as a result of that trip, and especially our follow-up
                        efforts.</p>
                    <p>I should be doing more of this kind of domestic travel and giving more
                        comprehensive speeches articulating our policies. I should also have a heavy
                        campaigning schedule which will enable me to play a stronger role as
                        spokesman for our programs. I don’t know if you concur with this conclusion
                        or not, but if you do I think it would be helpful in gaining greater public
                        understanding of and support for our goals. I don’t in any way wish to
                        de-emphasize my role with Congress or my advisory role with you, but I
                        believe my public education role has suffered somewhat.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Mood of the Country</p>
                    <p>I would like to mention just one thing about the so-called “conservative”
                        trend in the country that everyone is talking about. If you ask people
                        whether they are conservative or liberal, there is no question but that more
                        will identify themselves as conservatives than would have been the case
                        several years ago. But if you ask people whether government should help
                        provide more and better housing, education, health care, environmental
                        protection and the rest, a very high percentage of the population still
                        strongly supports government activity of that kind.</p>
                    <p>There is obviously great public concern about inflation and the management of
                        government. I don’t consider trying to deal with inflation or trying to
                        improve the management of government to be illiberal <pb n="373" facs="0414"
                            xml:id="pg_373"/>undertakings. Rather, I consider them to be necessities
                        if we are to have progressive government.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, there is broad support for progressive efforts. If we look at those
                        issues on which we have had the greatest success so far—in the progressive
                        areas of housing, jobs, economic development, strip mining, educational
                        funding, etc.—they have all been controversial initially but they all
                        enlisted strong and positive support in the Congress. Polls show your tax
                        reform proposals are supported publicly by better than 2 to 1 margins.</p>
                    <p>It is my hope that your Administration will demonstrate that we can have both
                        jobs and price stability. If we can, we will have a decisive advantage over
                        the Republican opposition which clearly favors trying to beat inflation at
                        the expense of jobs, a position which I consider to be insensitive.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A Contractual or Flexible Foreign Policy?</p>
                    <p>One thought has been gnawing at me recently that might be worth a minute or
                        two of your reflection. As I think about our foreign policy, I am struck by
                        the degree to which it can be rightly called a “contractual” foreign policy:
                        i.e., the major thrust of it is on <hi rend="italic">negotiating</hi>
                        agreements or devising formulas. It is reminiscent of legal negotiations and
                        it does not adequately take into account the need to manipulate and
                        influence political processes.</p>
                    <p>We have thus put a lot of effort into negotiating new proliferation
                        restraints, in negotiating new agreements with the Soviets, in negotiat<pb
                            n="374" facs="0415" xml:id="pg_374"/>ing new verbal formulas for dealing
                        with the Middle Eastern problem, in negotiating and then ratifying the
                        Panama Canal Treaties,<note n="2" xml:id="d76fn2">On March 16, the Senate
                            approved the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of
                            the Panama Canal by a vote of 68–32. (<hi rend="italic">Congress and the
                                Nation,</hi> vol. V, 1977–1980, p. 55) On April 18, the Senate voted
                            to ratify the basic treaty by the same vote of 68–32. (Adam Clymer,
                            “Senate Votes to Give up Panama Canal; <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"

                    <p>Yet foreign policy, though involving the foregoing, also involves the need to
                        influence attitudes and to shape political events. This requires a
                        combination of additional steps, none of which we have yet truly employed.
                        In some cases, what is needed is a demonstration of force, to establish
                        credibility and determination and even to infuse fear;<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d76fn3">The President underlined “demonstration of force” and
                            wrote “Like Malaguez [<hi rend="italic">Mayaguez</hi>?]?” in the
                            left-hand margin next to that portion of the sentence. He also
                            underlined “to infuse fear.”</note> in some cases it requires saying

                            “negotiating something else” and wrote in the left hand margin

                        exchange of political views, so that even our enemies share or at least
                        understand our perspectives. Often it does not require <hi rend="italic"
                            >solving</hi> problems but striking the right posture and sometimes
                        letting problems fester until they are ripe for action.</p>
                    <p>Examples of the foregoing would include quiet efforts <hi rend="italic">to
                            manipulate</hi> African leaders to obtain desired results; a willingness
                        to back some friendly country very strongly, so that it in turn is prepared

                        peoples or by using deception to divide the Soviets and Cubans on African
                            policy.<note n="6" xml:id="d76fn6">The President underlined “by using
                            deception” and placed a question mark in the left-hand margin next to

                    </p>
                    <p>I will be developing some ideas for you regarding the above,<note n="7"

                        but at this stage I simply wanted to register with you a basic point:
                        namely, that our foreign policy has to operate on many levels and use many
                        tools. The world is just too complicated and turbulent to be handled
                        effectively by negotiating “contracts” while neglecting the need also to
                        manipulate, to influence and to compel.</p>

                    <p>I have received recently a letter from a colleague who summarized for me some
                        criticisms of our Asian policy, which are shared by a number of Asian
                        specialists.</p>
                    <p>In summary form, his key points are these:</p>
                    <p>—Pacific Asia has been accorded too low priority.</p>
                    <p>—The Korean troop withdrawal has been unsettling; the timing was
                            precipitate.<note n="8" xml:id="d76fn8">See <ref target="#d53fn3"

                    </p>
                    <p>—Our naval posture is inadequate to deal with the growing Soviet
                        presence.</p>
                    <p>—U.S. weakness vis-a-vis Moscow justifiably causes China to view us as a less
                        attractive partner.</p>
                    <p>—We have not pursued our bilateral relations with China with sufficient
                        vigor.</p>
                    <p>—Our emphasis on normalizing relations with Vietnam makes little sense,
                        compared to the need to strengthen our ties with <gloss target="#t_ASEAN_1"
                            >ASEAN</gloss> countries.</p>
                    <p>—Our human rights policy has been poorly implemented, particularly its
                        emphasis on punitive measures against the violators rather than providing
                        incentives to those with improving records.</p>
                    <p>—We have failed to use the China card against the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>—Our weakened relations with Japan concern the entire region.</p>
                    <p>—In the absence of confidence in U.S. policy in Asia, normalization becomes
                        more difficult, for our assurances to Taiwan of our continued commitment to
                        its tranquility become less credible.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Foreign Assistance and U.S. Policy</p>
                    <p>Today I want to discuss with you a subject about which I care deeply because
                        of its importance to our nation. I speak of foreign assistance.</p>
                    <p>Over the years the League of Women Voters has endeavored to explain and
                        support our foreign assistance programs. You have done this as an essential
                        part of your nonpartisan program of public education. Your interest in and
                        knowledge of foreign assistance has been a key element in making people
                        aware of what their government is trying to achieve with these programs.</p>
                    <p>The United States has a profound stake in its relationships with the nations
                        and peoples in developing countries. Our response to their problems, needs,
                        and aspirations tests not only the quality of our leadership in the world
                        but our commitment to economic and social justice.</p>
                    <p>Let me begin our discussion by posing three questions. First, why do we have
                        foreign aid programs? Second, what are these programs designed to
                        accomplish? Third, do they work?</p>
                    <p>During the past 15 months as the <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> Administration fashioned aid budgets, reorganized aid
                        programs, and discussed aid issues with Congress, we have thought with great
                        care about these three questions. Today, in discussing our conclusions, I
                        want to return to the basic elements of our aid programs.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Why Foreign Aid</p>
                    <p>Our foreign policy flows from what we are as a people—our history, our
                        culture, our values, and our beliefs. One reason this nation has a foreign
                        aid program is that we believe we have a humanitarian and <pb n="377"
                            facs="0418" xml:id="pg_377"/>moral obligation to help alleviate poverty
                        and promote more equitable economic growth in the developing world.</p>
                    <p>We cannot be indifferent when half a billion people are hungry and
                        malnourished, when 700 million adults are illiterate, and when one and a
                        half billion people do not have minimal health care. As free people who have
                        achieved one of the highest standards of living in the world, we cannot fail
                        to respond to such staggering statistics and the individual lives they
                        encompass. We can be proud that we are a people who believe in the
                        development of human potential.</p>
                    <p>The answer to the question of why we have foreign aid programs also goes
                        beyond our system of values and our concern for the less fortunate. Foreign
                        aid is clearly in our national economic and political interest.</p>
                    <p>The success or failure of developing countries to grow more food, develop new
                        energy supplies, sell their raw materials and products, curb their
                        birthrates, and defend themselves against aggression will matter to
                        Americans.</p>
                    <p>Our economic health and our security are more closely tied today than ever
                        before to the economic well-being and security of the developing world.
                        Progress there means more jobs and more prosperity for the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>• The non-oil-producing developing countries are a major market for American
                        goods, taking a quarter of our total exports last year. About the same share
                        of our total exports goes to Europe and the Communist countries
                        combined.</p>
                    <p>• Products from less developed countries—including raw materials such as tin,
                        copper, bauxite, and lead—accounted for nearly a quarter of our total
                        imports last year.</p>
                    <p>• Our nation gained more than $7 billion from our direct private investment
                        in the developing world in 1975. And in 1976 developing countries absorbed
                        nearly $11 billion of our direct foreign investment.</p>
                    <p>• In the export of our agricultural abundance last year, developing countries
                        purchased half of our exports of cotton, 65% of our wheat, and nearly 70% of
                        our rice.</p>
                    <p>• Our economy benefits substantially as aid dollars are spent here to buy
                        commodities and services. For example, for every dollar we have paid into
                        such organizations as the World Bank and the regional development banks for
                        Latin America, Asia, and Africa, about $2 has been spent in the U.S.
                        economy.</p>
                    <p>The economic growth of the developing world is taking place primarily as a
                        result of massive efforts by the leaders and peoples of the developing
                        nations. For many, the most critical international factors in their growth
                        and development are our policies toward trade, invest<pb n="378" facs="0419"
                            xml:id="pg_378"/>ment, commodities, and technology. Our economic aid, as
                        well as that provided by other developed nations, also makes a crucial
                        contribution to their well-being. For some countries—particularly the
                        low-income nations—it is the principal source of foreign exchange and
                        technical assistance. But for many others, it serves as an essential
                        complement to other components of their development strategy.</p>
                    <p>In addition to America’s economic involvement in the developing world, our
                        political interests are strongly engaged as well. Developing countries are
                        often key participants in the quest for peace. Regional stability and peace
                        in the Middle East, southern Africa, and elsewhere cannot be achieved
                        without the cooperation of developing nations. Achieving progress on the
                        global issues which directly affect peace—arms restraint and
                        nonproliferation—depends in large measure on strengthening political ties
                        between the industrialized and developing worlds.</p>
                    <p>Our ties to developing countries are essential in many other areas which
                        affect our national security: in deploying our armed forces and in
                        maintaining access to straits, ports, and aviation facilities.</p>
                    <p>But the peace and stability we seek in the world cannot be obtained solely
                        through the maintenance of a strong defense in concert with others. The
                        social unrest which breeds conflict can best be prevented if economic growth
                        and an equitable distribution of resources are realized. As Pope John XXIII
                        so eloquently stated: “In a world of constant want there is no peace. . .
                        .”</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Foreign Assistance Programs</p>
                    <p>In view of the stakes involved, our foreign aid goals must be matched by our
                        performance. The <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>
                        Administration is asking the Congress to authorize and appropriate $8.4
                        billion for our economic, food, security assistance programs, and
                        contributions to the international financial institutions this fiscal year.
                        About 16% of this sum represents government guarantees and will not result
                        in actual spending. We are requesting these sums because we believe that
                        foreign aid can and does work. We believe it can have a direct impact on
                        economic growth and the maintenance of peace.</p>
                    <p>Let me give you a summary of what we are trying to do.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> in the area of bilateral economic assistance,
                        we are trying to determine the most effective way to channel this aid to
                        stimulate economic growth and alleviate poverty. In doing so we are
                        implementing a strategy which targets our resources directly on the needs of
                        the poor. Called the “basic human needs” approach, this development strategy
                        seeks to help people meet such basic needs as nutrition, shelter, education,
                        and health care. It is not an international welfare program. It is, in<pb
                            n="379" facs="0420" xml:id="pg_379"/>stead, an approach to development
                        which gives the poor a chance to improve their standard of living by their
                        own efforts.</p>
                    <p>• Farmers need good quality seed if they are going to escape subsistence
                        agriculture and grow enough food for their families and to sell at the
                        market as well. Our aid program in Tanzania, for instance, is helping that
                        government establish a seed multiplication project to provide improved seed
                        for the main crops grown there. The impact on the lives of Tanzanian farmers
                        should be large.</p>
                    <p>• In vast sections of West Africa, people cannot live in potentially fertile
                        agricultural areas because of a terrible disease—river blindness. We are
                        helping to finance efforts to suppress this affliction. Some success has
                        been achieved. Small farmers are already beginning to resettle in areas
                        which had been virtually abandoned.</p>
                    <p>• Education is critical to human development. In numerous poor countries, our
                        aid goes to training people in rural and urban areas in basic skills which
                        permit them to earn a better living. Education takes place in many ways
                        besides the schoolroom. It can be carried by low powered local radio
                        programs, such as one we fund in Guatemala, or by direct broadcast satellite
                        TV, as in an experiment we assisted in India.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Second,</hi> the programs of the World Bank and the
                        regional development banks through which we channel a significant amount of
                        our foreign aid range from large, capital intensive programs, such as dams
                        and roads, to smaller scale programs designed to directly improve the lives
                        of the poor. These institutions can mobilize and coordinate large amounts of
                        capital for development. And they can build consensus between aid donors and
                        recipients on development goals. In performing these roles, they well serve
                        U.S. interests. The work of these institutions is varied.</p>
                    <p>• In Buenaventura, Colombia—one of the poorest cities in the hemisphere—the
                        Inter-American Development Bank is trying to relocate slum dwellers and
                        provide the city with safe drinking water to reduce disease.</p>
                    <p>• In the West African country of Benin, the African Development Fund is
                        improving rural health services by constructing dispensaries in remote areas
                        and training people to run them.</p>
                    <p>• In Burma, an Asian Development Bank loan will increase fish production for
                        domestic consumption, thus raising the low protein intake of the
                        population.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Third,</hi> we support the development programs of the
                        United Nations, which finance technical assistance to poor countries and
                        provide direct humanitarian assistance to children, refugees, and other
                        groups in need of particular relief.</p>
                    <pb n="380" facs="0421" xml:id="pg_380"/>
                    <p>• In India, the U.N. Children’s Fund is working to restore and improve
                        potable water resources in the areas hardest hit by the November 1977
                        cyclone and tidal wave.</p>
                    <p>• In Central America, experts from the U.N. Development Program are working
                        in four countries to develop energy from underground volcanic steam.</p>
                    <p>I could go on and on, citing projects in various countries aimed at specific
                        problems and particular groups. The point is that when we are discussing aid
                        levels, we must remember we are not talking about abstract statistics: we
                        are talking about whether or not we can fund practical projects that make a
                        difference to people in need.</p>
                    <p>There is another important aspect of our foreign aid program which I would
                        like to mention very briefly—our security assistance programs.</p>
                    <p>These programs have three important objectives. First, they are designed to
                        assist our friends and allies to provide for their legitimate defense needs.
                        Second, these programs support our strategic and political objectives of
                        reducing tensions and promoting stability in areas of potential
                        confrontation and conflict. Third, they provide economic assistance to
                        countries which are experiencing political and economic stresses and where
                        U.S. security interests are involved. The vast majority of our security
                        assistance aid goes to support our peace efforts in the Middle East and in
                        southern Africa. In providing assistance to such nations, we help them meet
                        the economic strains imposed by tensions in their regions.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Does Foreign Aid Work?</p>
                    <p>Do all these programs work?</p>
                    <p>There is a popular myth that foreign assistance often does not produce
                        results. The record shows otherwise.</p>
                    <p>It is impossible to separate foreign assistance from other factors that
                        produce development. But foreign assistance has been central in some measure
                        to the following achievements.</p>
                    <p>• Between 1950 and 1975 the developing countries grew more rapidly than
                        either they or the developed countries had grown in any time period in the
                        past.</p>
                    <p>• Substantial increases in life expectancy are taking place in many
                        developing countries.</p>
                    <p>• The number of children in primary schools in the developing world has
                        trebled since 1950, and the number of secondary students has increased
                        sixfold during the same period.</p>
                    <p>• The battle against communicable disease has produced significant results.
                        Smallpox is now confined to a small area of Africa, and the <pb n="381"
                            facs="0422" xml:id="pg_381"/>numbers of people suffering from Malaria
                        has been reduced by 80–90% in the past three decades.</p>
                    <p>• The yields of rice and wheat in Asia are estimated to be substantially
                        higher today because of the introduction of high-yielding varieties. More
                        than a billion dollars worth of grain each year is ascribed to the new
                        seed.</p>
                    <p>Beyond these successes, the record reveals countless instances in which
                        projects funded by foreign assistance have improved the lives of people in
                        fundamental ways.</p>
                    <p>• When a village has clean water, its children are no longer made sick from
                        the water they drink.</p>
                    <p>• When couples have access to family planning services, there are fewer
                        mouths to feed.</p>
                    <p>• When a clinic is constructed, modern medicine enters lives for the first
                        time.</p>
                    <p>• And when a job program begins, the unemployed can find work and have
                        incomes.</p>
                    <p>Progress has been made. But more has to be done. Over the last 15 months the
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> Administration has made
                        a substantial effort to further improve the management and effectiveness of
                        all of our programs.</p>
                    <p>Let me report to you on some of the steps we have already taken or will soon
                        implement to achieve this objective.</p>
                    <p>One of the key problems with foreign assistance over the years has been a
                        lack of adequate coordination between our bilateral programs and our
                        activities in the international financial institutions. Responsibility for
                        these various programs is spread throughout several Cabinet Departments and
                        agencies.</p>
                    <p>Shortly before his death, Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHH_1">Hubert
                            Humphrey</persName> introduced legislation which called for a sweeping
                        reorganization of the government’s foreign aid programs designed to meet
                        these defects in coordination, The <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> Administration announced its support of the basic
                        purposes of this bill. Although the Congress will probably not consider this
                        legislation in the current session, the Administration is moving to put into
                        place a new interagency coordinating mechanism which we believe will go a
                        long way toward having the executive branch better coordinate its diverse
                        development efforts.<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2">

                            foreign aid agency charged with administering bilateral and multilateral

                    <p>The Agency for International Development has been reorganized under the
                        leadership of Governor <persName corresp="#p_GJJ_1">John
                        Gilligan</persName>. More authority is being delegated to our <gloss
                            target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> missions abroad. Tighter controls are now
                        imposed on financial and operational procedures. In addition, <gloss
                            target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> has eliminated some complex and cumbersome
                        procedures which have slowed our ability to design and implement
                        projects.</p>
                    <p>The United States has encouraged the multilateral banks to better take into
                        account the lessons of the past—both successes and failures. The
                        Administration has also shared congressional concerns about high salary
                        levels of bank employees. We want the banks to look especially hard at more
                        effective ways to reach poor people directly, as well as to operate in the
                        most cost effective ways.</p>
                    <p>In our security programs we have tightened management controls and have
                        instituted an interagency committee to provide coordinated recommendations
                        to me and the President on all aspects of our arms transfer and security
                        assistance programs.<note n="3" xml:id="d77fn3">Presumable reference to the

                    </p>
                    <p>Finally, because we recognize that science and technology offer many
                        opportunities for expanding the development process, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> has proposed the creation of a new
                        U.S. foundation on technological collaboration.<note n="4" xml:id="d77fn4"
                            >Presumable reference to the proposed Foundation for International
                            Technological Cooperation (FITC).</note> This foundation will support
                        the application of our research to development problems. And it will improve
                        the access of the developing countries to American science and
                        technology.</p>
                    <p>We will continue to seek ways to improve the management and delivery of our
                        foreign assistance programs. Accountability to the Congress and to the
                        public is an essential element of our approach.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Other Key Issues</p>
                    <p>There are several other important questions relating to our foreign
                        assistance programs which I would like to discuss.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> there is a growing belief that we are both
                        giving more aid and at the same time losing control over where it goes. Let
                        me put this issue in perspective.</p>
                    <p>Clearly, we are not shouldering a disproportionate burden of global aid
                        flows. While in absolute terms the U.S. aid program is larger than that of
                        any other nation, as a percentage of <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> we
                        rank in the bottom 25% of all non-Communist country donors.</p>
                    <p>Concerning control, we are very active in attempting to steer multilateral
                        assistance in directions we think best for our nation and for global
                        development. We have often been successful in encouraging the <pb n="383"
                            facs="0424" xml:id="pg_383"/>types of projects consistent with our
                        desired policies. We will be working closely with Congress to develop
                        procedures which permit the United States to express its views about
                        multilateral lending policies as effectively as possible. But in doing so,
                        we must recognize the damage that would be done if the international
                        character of these institutions were lost.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Second,</hi> our foreign assistance programs must be
                        consistent with our determination to improve the conditions of political,
                        economic, and civil rights worldwide. Over the past year we have reviewed
                        all of our aid programs for their impact on human rights. In some cases we
                        have reduced assistance to governments with consistent records of
                        repression. We have also increased aid to others with good or improving
                        human rights policies.</p>
                    <p>We face a dilemma when applying human rights considerations to foreign
                        assistance. We do not want to support governments which consistently violate
                        human rights. On the other hand, we do not wish to deny our assistance to
                        poor people who happen to live under repressive regimes. We must resolve
                        this dilemma on a case-by-case basis. In general, we have approved aid
                        programs when they would directly benefit the poor since we recognize that
                        people have economic as well as political rights.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Third,</hi> there is the question of which countries
                        should receive our aid. The President has decided that our concessional
                        assistance programs should focus primarily but not exclusively on the
                        poorest countries. In the more advanced developing countries we do not want
                        to substitute our own support for the assistance those governments should be
                        giving. On the other hand, we cannot be indifferent to the plight of people
                        who are no less poor because they live in middle income countries and who
                        need our help. We are resolving this problem by insisting that our efforts
                        to mount programs in middle income developing nations be matched by efforts
                        of the host country.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Fourth,</hi> it is sometimes argued that we cannot afford
                        to spend large amounts of money to help solve problems abroad when we have
                        many pressing domestic needs. But I firmly believe that it would be a
                        serious mistake to try to trade off international obligations for domestic
                        priorities. Both need to be addressed.</p>
                    <p>The health of our nation is increasingly dependent on the world economy. If
                        we neglect international progress, we undermine the welfare of our own
                        society. As a nation we have a major concern with improving the lives of
                        poor people. I do not believe this is a credible commitment if made only
                        domestically. And as a percentage of the Federal budget for 1979, our
                        economic assistance is only 1.47%. Adding our security assistance programs
                        does not increase this figure substantially.</p>
                    <pb n="384" facs="0425" xml:id="pg_384"/>
                    <p>We can afford to increase foreign aid expenditures at a reasonable rate, as
                        we must. At the same time, we can afford to increase our domestic education
                        budget, expand programs for the elderly, and fund other critical domestic
                        programs as we are now doing. Helping the children of Pakistan have adequate
                        diets does not mean that we need neglect the children of Cincinnati, Boston,
                        or Los Angeles. Helping the farmers of Mali grow more food does not mean we
                        need to abandon the farmers of Texas, Illinois, or Colorado. And helping the
                        nations of the Middle East remain at peace does not mean that we cannot help
                        meet the needs of our cities. We do not have a choice. Both foreign aid and
                        adequate domestic expenditures are essential to the national interest.</p>
                    <p>Senator Humphrey raised a fundamental issue about foreign aid. He said: “The
                        question we must decide is whether or not the conditions of social and
                        economic injustice—poverty, illiteracy, and disease—are a real threat to our
                        security. I think they are and they require the same commitment of policy,
                        will, and resources as does our conventional national defense.”</p>
                    <p>As someone charged with helping to protect the national security, I agree
                        with Senator Humphrey’s assessment of the role of foreign aid in the scheme
                        of our national priorities. I agree with his approach to the tasks of
                        alleviating poverty and working for peace.</p>
                    <p>He believed in harnessing the energy and creativity of the American people to
                        solve problems which have plagued the world for centuries. I share his faith
                        in our abilities. I share his optimism that we can do the job.</p>
                    <p>I ask that you help us inform the American people why foreign aid is
                        essential to the nation’s economic health, political interests, and
                        preservation of its humanitarian tradition.</p>

                            “One way to reduce public confusion over our policy is for all top
                            officials to use certain key formulations when speaking about foreign
                            affairs. Indeed, the repetition of certain ’code phrases’ (e.g.,
                            ’détente must be both comprehensive and reciprocal’) will help to
                            indicate that we speak with a single voice from the top down.” He added
                            that the attached memorandum “is designed to accomplish that objective.”

                    <p>In order to infuse greater clarity into public understanding of our foreign
                        policy, the President wishes that all Cabinet members understand our key

                        cooperation. This means developing new and wider relationships with such

                    <p>On May 5, 1978, President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Jimmy
                            Carter</persName> delivered remarks at a town hall meeting at the
                        Convention Center in Spokane, Washington. <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> visited Spokane as part of a 3-day trip, May 3–5, to
                        Colorado, California, Washington, and Oregon. After an introduction by
                        Representative <persName corresp="#p_FTS_1">Thomas Foley</persName>
                        (D-Washington) and Senator <persName corresp="#p_MWG_1">Warren
                            Magnuson</persName> (D-Washington), the President discussed several
                        domestic issues, including inflation and the administration’s energy
                        program, conceding that there were “no easy answers” to these problems
                        facing the United States. Foreign policy, he continued, failed to yield easy
                        answers as well:</p>
                    <p>“I know that in the past we’ve made some very serious mistakes. The Vietnam
                        war, Watergate, the <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> revelations have
                        kind of torn the fabric of our society, because the American people were not
                        involved in making those decisions. We were faced with mistakes for the
                        first time after they were revealed to us. And we create, sometimes, in the
                        minds <pb n="387" facs="0428" xml:id="pg_387"/>of American people, an image
                        that we don’t know exactly what we want to do.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t claim to know everything about what we want to do. But we try to
                        bring the debate out into the open and let various voices be heard, so that
                        when I do make a final decision about <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        talks or nonproliferation, or the use of solar power, or the control of the
                        waste of energy, or farm agriculture policy, or urban policy, I will have
                        listened to hundreds, even thousands of voices of Americans who know better
                        answers than I do about a specific subject and who care deeply about our
                        country.</p>
                    <p>“So, to me it’s important that we do have some confusion, that we do have an
                        open debate, that we do have disputes on occasion and even outright
                        criticisms. I think that’s good in a strong, democratic society. I don’t
                        fear it. I also don’t fear addressing some very difficult questions that
                        have been ignored too long and have now become crises in our Nation.”</p>
                    <p>During the subsequent question-and-answer portion of the event, an audience
                        member asked the President if he viewed Soviet and Cuban intervention in
                        Africa as a “test” of U.S. policy, then rephrased the question to inquire as
                        to the nature of U.S. policy “toward Soviet intervention” in Africa and
                        elsewhere. The President responded:</p>
                    <p>“I think we are holding our own in the so-called peaceful competition with
                        the Soviet Union, in Africa, and in other parts of the world. Again, I hate
                        to refer repeatedly to what existed in the past, but I think it’s accurate
                        to say that never before in the history of our Nation have we shown any
                        substantial interest in the continent of Africa.</p>
                    <p>“Just a few weeks ago, I visited Nigeria, the greatest nation in Africa in
                        many ways—economically, population, vigor, influence, growing influence.
                        There are about 100 million people who live in Nigeria. It’s one of the
                        present and future leaders of black Africa. I was the first American
                        President, by the way, in the history of our country who had ever made an
                        official visit to a black African nation.</p>
                    <p>“Two or three years ago when Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName> wanted to go and visit Nigeria, the country would
                        not even let him enter that country. But I was received with open arms in a
                        tremendous outpouring of friendship and realization of mutual purpose.</p>
                    <p>“We are trying to do the same thing in other parts of Africa, particularly
                        where the black nations exist. We’ve got a good advantage in having a man
                        like <persName corresp="#p_YAJ_1">Andrew Young</persName> head our United
                        Nations delegation. He’s trusted by black people, not only in Africa but in
                        the Caribbean area, in Latin America, and around the world—also in this
                        country, of course. But just the fact that I appointed him to be our U.N.
                        Ambassador is a demonstration to those people in tangible terms that we care
                        about them for the first time in 200 years.</p>
                    <pb n="388" facs="0429" xml:id="pg_388"/>
                    <p>“Now, the Soviets are obviously trying to use their influence in Africa and
                        other parts of the world. In many instances when they have come into a
                        nation that has a changing government, their major input has been weapons,
                        and they are much more easy to buy weapons from than we are. They will
                        supply excessive weapons to countries like Somalia and Ethiopia, in the Horn
                        of Africa, resulting in this instance by an attack on Ethiopia on Somalia
                        with Soviet weapons. Both countries got them from the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>“The Soviets have gone into Ethiopia, using Cuban troops to fight against
                        Somalia. I deplore this very much. In the strongest possible terms we have
                        let the Soviets and Cubans know that this is a danger to American-Soviet
                        friendship and to the nurturing and enhancement of the principle of
                        détente.</p>
                    <p>“The Soviets know very clearly how deeply I feel about this. I’ve
                        communicated directly with Brezhnev through private, sealed messages. And Cy
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> just came back from Moscow
                        recently, having repeated to the Soviets, ’Be careful how you use your
                        military strength in Africa if you want to be a friend of the United States
                        and maintain peace throughout the world.’</p>
                    <p>“So, I think that they are mistaken. There’s a strong sense of nationalism in
                        Africa. Once the Soviets are there to help with military weapons when a new
                        government is formed, then the people of that country almost invariably want
                        the Soviets to get out and let them run their own affairs.</p>
                    <p>“I think there’s an innate racism that exists toward black people within the
                        Soviet Union, as compared to us. We know how to live with white and black
                        people together. We respect each other. We’ve learned this the hard way. But
                        there’s a great deal of appreciation in Africa for this attitude on the part
                        of the United States, as contrasted with the Soviet Union. And there’s
                        another very major factor that I mentioned yesterday morning in Denver at
                        the Governor’s Prayer Breakfast, and that is that there’s a strong sense of
                        religious commitment throughout black Africa and indeed the northern part of
                        Africa as well, Egypt and the others. They may be Arabs, they may be
                        Moslems, they may be Christians or others, but they worship God.</p>
                    <p>“And this is a sense or a mechanism of a feeling of brotherhood and
                        sisterhood that binds us together very strongly. They recognize that the
                        Soviet Union is a Communist and an atheistic nation, and it’s a very present
                        concern in the minds and hearts of Africans who, on a temporary basis, will
                        turn to the Soviets to buy weapons because we won’t sell the weapons to
                        them.</p>
                    <p>“We come in later with economic aid, with trade, with friendship, with the
                        commitment to democracy and freedom, to human rights, and I believe in the
                        long run our system will prevail. We could compete <pb n="389" facs="0430"
                            xml:id="pg_389"/>more directly and effectively with the Soviets on a
                        temporary basis by trying to sell our weapons to every country that calls
                        for them. I don’t think that’s the right approach.</p>
                    <p>“I’d rather depend on the basic commitment of American people to human
                        rights, to religious commitment and freedom, and to a sense of equality with
                        those people who might be brown or yellow or black, than to depend on the
                        Soviets trying to buy friendship through the sale of weapons designed to
                        kill.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"

                    <p>On May 28, 1978, reporters Bob Abernethy and <persName corresp="#p_MWB_1"
                            >Bill Monroe</persName> of <gloss target="#t_NBC_1">NBC</gloss> News,
                            <persName corresp="#p_DE_1">Elizabeth Drew</persName> of <hi
                            rend="italic">The New Yorker</hi> and <persName corresp="#p_RCT_1">Carl
                            T. Rowan</persName> of Field Syndicate interviewed President’s Assistant
                        for National Security Affairs <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Zbigniew
                            Brzezinski</persName> on the <gloss target="#t_NBC_1">NBC</gloss>
                        television and radio public affairs program “Meet the Press.” Responding to
                        a question as to the viability of détente in light of recent Soviet actions
                        and U.S. criticisms thereof, <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                            >Brzezinski</persName> asserted:</p>
                    <p>“As far as détente is concerned, I think it is terribly important for all of
                        us to understand what it is and what it is not. There is a tendency to
                        assume that détente is the equivalent of a comprehensive, indeed, total
                        accommodation between the United States and the Soviet Union. That has never
                        been the case.</p>
                    <p>“Détente really is a process of trying to contain some of the competitive
                        aspects in the relationship, competitive aspects which I believe still are
                        predominant, and to widen the cooperative aspects. In that process at one
                        time or another either the cooperative or the competitive aspects tend to be
                        more predominant.</p>
                    <p>“I would say today the competitive aspects have somewhat surfaced and I would
                        say categorically that this is due to the shortsighted Soviet conduct in the
                        course of the last 2 or so years.”</p>
                    <p>Referring to <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s use of the
                        word “shortsighted,” one of the reporters asked <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                            >Brzezinski</persName> if he had any reason to believe that Soviet
                        conduct “would cease” to be shortsighted. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                            >Brzezinski</persName> responded:</p>
                    <p>“I think that if the Soviet Union realizes that there are genuine rewards in
                        accommodation and genuine costs in unilateral exploitation of the world’s
                        troubles, then the cooperative aspects will expand.</p>
                    <pb n="391" facs="0432" xml:id="pg_391"/>
                    <p>“I am troubled by the fact that the Soviet Union has been engaged in a
                        sustained and massive effort to build up its conventional forces,
                        particularly in Europe, to strengthen the concentration of its forces on the
                        frontiers of China, to maintain a vitriolic worldwide propaganda campaign
                        against the United States, to encircle and penetrate the Middle East, to
                        stir up racial difficulties in Africa, and to make more difficult a moderate
                        solution of these difficulties, perhaps now to seek more direct access to
                        the Indian Ocean.</p>
                    <p>“This pattern of behavior I do not believe is compatible with what was once
                        called the code of détente, and my hope is, through patient negotiations
                        with us, but also through demonstrated resolve on our part, we can induce
                        the Soviet leaders to conclude that the benefits of accommodation are
                        greater than the shortsighted attempt to exploit global difficulties.”</p>
                    <p>Following several questions related to Africa and <persName
                            corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s trip to China (see <ref
                            target="#d62fn21">footnote 21, Document 62</ref>), the interview
                        returned to the topic of the Soviet Union. Referencing the list of Soviet
                        actions <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> had described,
                        one of the journalists then asked <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                            >Brzezinski</persName> if he would be in favor of linking U.S. trade and
                        technology transfers to Soviet behavior. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                            >Brzezinski</persName> commented:</p>
                    <p>“First of all, I don’t think it was a string of horrible things. It was a
                        list of actions undertaken apparently in a combative or competitive spirit
                        in order to gain political advantage in relationship to us. This is the kind
                        of conduct we wish to transform, to moderate.</p>
                    <p>“Our response to it does operate on many levels. On the one hand we try to
                        negotiate with the Soviets where it is mutually useful to negotiate—for
                        example, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. On the other hand, we are
                        trying to strengthen ourselves where it is necessary, and we have done a
                        great deal, for example, in regard to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                        >NATO</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>“Beyond that we are trying to develop stronger relationships with various
                        regional powers which do feel threatened by the Soviet Union and which, if
                        encouraged and supported, can themselves help to provide overall global
                        stability. Last but not least, we are enhancing our own long-term
                        relationship with the People’s Republic of China as a contribution to global
                        stability.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t believe we are wringing our hands. I think we are trying to respond
                        responsibly to a complicated and difficult challenge.” (Department of State
                            <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> July 1978, pages 27–28)</p>
                    <p>In his memoirs, <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> noted that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Jimmy Carter</persName> expressed
                        concern over his appearance on “Meet the Press.” On the morning of May 29,
                        the President informed <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                        that he “went too far” in placing blame on the Soviet Union. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> recounted:</p>
                    <p>“He went on to say that my comments might even threaten détente and he was
                        wondering whether he shouldn’t write a letter to Brezhnev <pb n="392"
                            facs="0433" xml:id="pg_392"/>to reiterate his commitment to <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. I told the President that ’it’s really
                        important that we discuss this fully, because this raises a question of
                        fundamental judgment. In my view, the West confronts a basic danger, and how
                        we respond may be decisive to the future of this country.’ I added that I
                        was distressed if my statements went further than he felt they should, and I
                        asked him to review the transcript of what I said and not just rely on the
                        Washington <hi rend="italic">Post</hi> reporting of it.” (<hi rend="italic"
                            >Power and Principle,</hi> pages 220–221)</p>
                    <p>Summarizing his view of <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s
                        “Meet the Press” interview in his diary entry for May 29, the President
                        wrote:</p>
                    <p>“On <hi rend="italic">Meet the Press</hi>, Zbig was very abusive against the
                        Soviets—excessively so—and I chastised him about it. He was quite upset. I
                        don’t want to create sympathy for the Soviets among the European allies, or
                        to drive them away from continued negotiations with us on <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and the comprehensive test ban. The
                        saving grace about it is that Zbig’s always had a reputation of being
                        anti-Soviet. I told him our relationships with the Soviet Union were much
                        more important than those with China as far as the safety of our country is
                        concerned—the prevention of war—at least for the rest of this century.” (<hi

                            denunciation on “Meet the Press” of Soviet behavior (see <ref

                                >Brzezinski</persName> to insist that the administration had to
                            “speak with one voice,” noting that <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName>’s remarks “were making it less clear who was

                            that he had written to the President and complained to him.” (<hi

                    </opener>
                    <p>I would like to put before you some reflections on the current and future
                        state of our relations with the Soviet Union, and some suggestions on how
                        these relations might best be managed in the coming months. The matter is
                        urgent, because I believe we face the prospect of a serious deterioration of
                        these relations in coming months.</p>
                    <p>It is extremely important, I believe, that we work through a clear set of
                        guidelines on this issue that can be used to instruct all levels of the
                        government and to provide a basis for explaining our policies to the
                        American people. For our public, our allies, and the Third World, it is
                        important to dispel any impression of uncertainty or unresolved conceptual
                        differences.</p>
                    <p>My thoughts on the subject follow:</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>An intense mood of exasperation and hostility toward the Soviet Union is
                        rapidly building up in this country. In part, the mood draws its intensity
                        from a reaction to the complexity and difficulty of many problems in
                        international affairs and from the aftermath of Vietnam. But there are also
                        elements more directly related to the Soviet situation:</p>
                    <pb n="394" facs="0435" xml:id="pg_394"/>
                    <p>—Frustration over recent developments in Africa and Afghanistan, made more
                        difficult by a high level of Soviet and Cuban involvement, and compounded by
                        what is seen as our inability to respond effectively to these developments
                        in the short run.</p>
                    <p>—Concern over the widespread impression that the United States appears to
                        have become militarily weaker and less resolute, and that the Soviet Union

                    <p>On the Soviet side, there also appears to be building up a mood of greater
                        harshness and frustration. We must contend with a Soviet perspective, which,
                        however much we would challenge its validity, contains the following
                        elements:</p>
                    <p>—The Soviets regard their moves in Africa as falling within the bounds of
                        acceptable competition for influence;</p>
                    <p>—They regard our interest in the dissidents as a sign of our desire to
                        overthrow their system;</p>
                    <p>—They feel frustrated and upset that they have been excluded from effective
                        action in the Middle East;</p>
                    <p>—They react sharply to disparagements from our side;</p>
                    <p>—Overall, they see our actions as unpredictable, and they have become
                        uncertain whether we now want a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        treaty.</p>
                    <p>If this Soviet mood, which feeds upon as well as feeds the American mood, is
                        translated into new Soviet hard-line actions, it could mean still greater
                        military expenditures (which we should and will match); concerns among our
                        allies upon which the Soviets will play; greater mischief-making in Africa;
                        an active rejectionist strategy in the Middle East; and new Soviet pressures
                        on Eastern Europe. The prospect of a summit this fall could obviously be
                        clouded.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Soviet relationship has special
                        importance now because there will probably be leadership changes in the
                        Soviet Union in the near future, and the cast of our relationship at that
                        time may set the tone and direction of our relationship for a long time to
                        come.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the foreign policy developments that could be anticipated from
                        a severe deterioration in <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Soviet
                        relations, I am concerned about the effect on our domestic political
                        situation. While there may well be short-term favorable response, at least
                        from some quarters, I believe the dominant response, especially over a
                        longer period, would <pb n="395" facs="0436" xml:id="pg_395"/>be strongly
                        negative. The applause would come from sectors of American political life
                        who are not likely to be numbered among your supporters, whereas the
                        prevailing sentiment among your natural constituency would surely be a
                        negative reaction to the intensified arms race, the renewal of Cold War
                        tensions, and the consequent weakening of domestic programs. The heightening
                        of militancy, the polarization of political positions, and the destructive
                        emotional tensions that would be generated would make it more difficult to
                        realize the objectives to which you have dedicated your Administration.</p>

                    <p>To put our relations on a more stable footing, while advancing our interests
                        and clarifying our public stance, we need to take steps to insure that we
                        have a coherent approach in three general areas: our direct relations with
                        the Soviets; our competition (as well as cooperation) in third areas; and
                        our public position.</p>
                    <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Direct Relations</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The essential issue here is the military balance. The fact is that the Soviet
                        Union has greatly increased its defense expenditures in the past fifteen
                        years while ours have declined in real terms since the Vietnam War years. It
                        is also true that the Soviets have now reached a state of broad equivalence
                        with us, certainly in terms of military strength and, to a lesser extent, in
                        terms of military reach. The question is whether they will seek to go beyond
                        parity to dominance in some areas.</p>
                    <p>Our response, as put in <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Harold Brown</persName>’s
                        excellent posture statement, is the right one: a prudent increase in our

                        forces while maintaining our strength in the Pacific.<note n="3"

                    <p>Stabilizing the arms competition between ourselves and the Soviets is the
                        other essential element of maintaining the military balance. A major
                        priority in the Soviet-American relationship is therefore the negotiation of
                        a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> treaty. Despite all that is said
                        about the difficulty of getting the treaty ratified, I believe that when it
                        is signed and presented to the Congress, major sources of support will
                        emerge as you and the entire Administration make a major effort to carry the
                        case to the American people. Ultimately, with proper preparation, I believe
                        this issue can be made a political advantage instead of the liability it is
                        now wrongly thought to be.</p>

                        relationship with the Soviet Union. The ratification process in the United
                        States will provide an incentive for responsible Soviet behavior that does
                        not now exist.</p>
                    <p>Another aspect of our direct relations—human rights—deserves review.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets seem to be engaged in a draconian effort to reduce the dissident
                        movement by trials, harsh sentences, additional arrests and detentions, and
                        a severance of contacts between dissidents and Western newsmen. It seems
                        probable that the Orlov trial will be followed in June by the trials of
                        Ginsburg and <persName corresp="#p_SA_3">Shcharanskiy</persName>.<note n="4"

                        now appears that after some indecision the Soviet authorities concluded,

                        conciliate Western pressures on the human rights issue, and would try to
                        reduce their vulnerability on these issues by rigorous police measures.<note

                            be aware that Western public opinion will be drawing its own conclusions
                            about Soviet respect for the Helsinki agreement and about the nature of
                            future U.S.-Soviet relations. All of us, in the East and West, will be
                            the losers if the Soviet authorities ignore their Helsinki commitments.”

                    <p>The one favorable development in this area is that the level of Jewish
                        emigration has continued to increase in recent months.</p>
                    <p>I believe it would be useful for us now to study the experience of the past
                        16 months in order to refine the forms and intensity of pressure that seem
                        to be most productive, as well as the most effective combination of
                        governmental and private forms of pressure. We need to form a judgment on
                        how best to use our influence to give some measure of protection to
                        prominent dissidents, and to encourage longer-term movement toward greater
                        constraints on the Soviet political police. From our experience thus far, it
                        seems clear that public attention can afford only a measure of protection to
                        prominent dissidents. There is a critical point beyond which the effect of
                        public pressure has been to stiffen Soviet determination not to capitulate,
                        and to encourage harsher measures.</p>
                    <p>Our ability to influence Soviet behavior on this and other issues would be
                        stronger if there were the prospect of improved trade relations, which now
                        appear remote.</p>

                        with each. Clearly Chinese attitudes toward us are heavily influenced by our
                        policies towards the Soviets. Zbig’s trip was useful in indicating to the

                    </p>
                    <p>Increasingly, we are faced with two differing views of the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Soviet relationship; although so far we have
                        managed to combine the two in our public statements, it is becoming more
                        difficult to do. We have always recognized that the relationship between the
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and the Soviet Union has been a
                        combination of cooperation and competition, with the competition not
                        preventing either side from seeking agreements in our mutual benefit in such
                        areas as <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. Now, however, we are coming
                        to the point where there is growing pressure on the part of some people to
                        have us portray the competitive aspects of the relationship as taking clear
                        precedence over the search for areas for cooperation. This fundamental issue
                        has begun to spill out into the public domain through recent statements and
                        press interviews. It should be resolved within the government in order to
                        avoid presenting a picture of division which will weaken us.</p>
                    <p>We have an interest in expanding areas of cooperation with the Soviets, not
                        only through direct exchanges but in diplomatic or programmatic cooperation
                        in their areas of the world.</p>
                    <p>But the harsh reality is that a growing Soviet military reach is being
                        translated into an increasingly assertive Soviet competitive drive in the
                        Third World, with a focus on Africa.</p>
                    <p>We cannot object to competition. It is inherent in our relationship. To
                        insist that detente be made perfect is to ensure that competition in any
                        area will prejudice the possibility of progress in other areas.</p>

                        elsewhere, we do not and should not link Soviet behavior in the Third World

                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. Yet Soviet behavior will of
                        course affect the willingness of the American people and the Congress to

                    <p>While we cannot put an end to competition or to Soviet efforts to help insure
                        territorial integrity at the request of African governments, we can and
                        should make clear our opposition to military adventures which exacerbate
                        conflicts, inhibit peacemaking, and go beyond reasonable defensive efforts.
                        In particular, we should expose attempts to gain political advantage through
                        encouraging bloodshed.</p>
                    <p>It is evident that we cannot <hi rend="italic">force</hi> a change in Soviet
                        and Cuban policies in Africa. But there are many things we can do to
                        influence their decisions. If we are to preserve our interest in <gloss

                        do all we sensibly can to deter and prevent further Soviet/Cuban adventures
                        in Africa and encourage their gradually scaling down their activities.</p>
                    <p>Such a strategy includes efforts designed to strengthen our friends, limit
                        the areas in which the Soviets and Cubans can find easy entree, build
                        longer-term relationships with the countries of the region. The execution of
                        this strategy is underway:</p>
                    <p>—We have steadily increased our public and private diplomatic pressures
                        directed against the Soviets and Cubans themselves, emphasizing our concern
                        and interest in stability and peace in Africa.</p>
                    <p>—We have intensified our consultations with non-aligned states. A number of
                        these states share our views about Cuban and Soviet actions, and have urged
                        restraint on Moscow and Havana. Our European allies and some African and
                        Arab moderates have made parallel diplomatic approaches; and Iraqi, Syrian,
                        and Algerian pressures against the Soviets and Cubans in Eritrea may in part
                        have flowed from this effort.</p>
                    <p>—We have strengthened our ties with African countries over the last year,
                        particularly through our commitment to help resolve the southern African
                        disputes. This has fundamentally contributed to our credibility throughout
                        the continent and to limiting opportunities for Soviets and Cubans.</p>
                    <p>—Our substantially increased economic assistance, and the military assistance
                        we have offered some of the more vulnerable countries in east Africa, have
                        provided us with strong cards in many countries.</p>
                    <p>—Our long-term plans for further increases in economic aid to the area,
                        greater effort to help Africans increase their trade with us, and offers of
                        appropriate technology in assisting African economic development are tools
                        we can exploit and which the Soviets cannot match.</p>
                    <p>—Above all, African nationalism itself—while not a tool we can use
                        directly—is the most powerful force available against extended Soviet and
                        Cuban influence. The inevitable role this force will play offers us
                        considerable grounds for optimism over the next few years, assuming southern
                        Africa does not explode into a major racial war.</p>

                        reviewing other measures we might take to limit or constrain the Soviets and

                    </p>
                    <p>It is essential that we project publicly a sense of confidence and
                        consistency as we pursue a coherent and long-term strategy towards the
                        Soviets.</p>
                    <p>It is damaging when our policies are characterized as either “hard” or
                        “soft,” or as swinging between those poles. In either case, such
                        characterizations irritate one group or another in the United States; send
                        the wrong signals to the Soviets and our allies; give disproportionate
                        emphasis to one aspect or another of our policies, which properly contain
                        both “hard” and “soft” elements; and tend to encourage the damaging and
                        unrealistic swings of public mood from gloom to euphoria and back again.</p>
                    <p>We should give more attention than we have to the psychological side of our
                        relations with the Soviet Union. We are less likely to get the Soviets to
                        move in directions we want by demanding that they capitulate to public
                        pressure, than by leaving the way open for them to move with pride intact,
                        having made our wishes known in private. While we should continue to
                        criticize the Soviet Union in appropriate ways when it is called for, public
                        expressions of indignation by themselves tend to emphasize our apparent
                        impotence, and to inflame public and Congressional sentiment in ways that
                        are unproductive. (Witness the declaration of nine Senators last week<note

                    <p>In a more positive sense, we can help encourage a more cooperative attitude
                        on the part of the Soviet leaders by conspicuous attention to the sense of
                        equality to which they attach so much importance. And if they respond
                        positively, we should refrain from crowing about any gestures they may
                        make.</p>
                    <p>In protesting Soviet lack of restraint, it is important for us to be precise
                        in our complaints rather than general, tailoring our demands for Soviet
                        action to the seriousness of the situations and the real degree <pb n="400"
                            facs="0441" xml:id="pg_400"/>of control and initiative exercised by
                        Moscow. We should pick our targets for a sharpshooter’s rifle, not a
                        shotgun.</p>
                    <p>An improvement—both in substance and in public perceptions—may lie in making
                        two important distinctions. We must distinguish between what it is possible
                        to gain in the way of altered Soviet behavior, and what is not. And, in our
                        public stance, we should concentrate as much on what we are doing to compete
                        as on Soviet behavior to which we object.</p>
                    <p>Whenever we make public demands for actions the Soviets do not then take, or
                        build up their power or activities, we make ourselves look weak.</p>
                    <p>It would be better, in international and domestic political terms, to exhibit
                        a great firmness, giving stronger emphasis than we are now doing to <hi

                            <hi rend="italic">our</hi> actions—in the defense budget, in Africa, in

                        hold most of the cards in the East-West competition.</p>
                    <p>After there is agreement on the various elements of that strategy towards the
                        Soviets, I recommend that:</p>

                            >Gromyko</persName>, for an extended period of time, where we stand in
                        our relations and what both sides can do to prevent a serious

                        confidence, and tact with which you seek realistically to regulate a
                        basically competitive relationship in ways that will be less dangerous for
                        the world.<note n="10" xml:id="d82fn10">The President delivered a speech on

                    <p>The thoughts that I have shared with you in this letter are the result of my

                        essential to do a careful and searching analysis of our options for dealing
                        with these central questions of American foreign policy over the next few
                        years.</p>

                        us to get on with the real business of government and society, the business

                    <p>The alliance born that day in April 1949 has helped preserve our mutual
                        security for nearly 30 years, almost a decade longer than the time between
                        the two great wars of this century. History records no other alliance that
                        has successfully brought together so many different nations for so long
                        without the firing of a single shot in anger.</p>
                    <p>Ours is a defensive alliance. No nation need fear aggression from us, but
                        neither should any nation ever doubt our will to deter and to defeat
                        aggression against us. The North Atlantic Alliance is a union of peoples
                        moved by a desire to secure a safe future for our children in liberty and
                        freedom. Our Alliance is unique, because each of us 15 democratic nations
                        shares a common heritage of human values, the rule of law, and faith in the
                        courage and spirit of free men and women.</p>
                    <p>The military strength and the common political purpose of the North Atlantic

                        conferring upon us the name of “community.” And it has given us the
                        self-confidence and strength of will to seek improved relations with our
                        potential adversaries.</p>
                    <p>As an American I am proud that the commitment of the United States to the
                        security, independence, and prosperity of Europe is as strong as ever. We
                        are part of you, and you are part of us. The mutual pledges of trust we
                        exchanged here in 1949 still hold firm and true.</p>
                    <p>During the next 2 days we will reaffirm our commitment to the Alliance, to
                        its strategy and doctrine, and to each other. We will review a year-long
                        effort to assess East-West relations as they exist now and as they may
                        develop in the future. We will review our cooperation in defense
                        procurement. And through a broad program of defense cooperation, we will
                        seek to reinforce our individual efforts to guarantee our security against
                        aggression for many years ahead.</p>
                    <p>We must be aware of the new challenges that we face individually and
                        collectively, which require new efforts of us all.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries pose a military threat to
                        our Alliance which far exceeds their legitimate security needs. For more
                        than a decade the military power of the Soviet Union has steadily expanded,
                        and it has grown consistently more sophisticated. In significant areas the
                        military lead we once enjoyed has been reduced.</p>
                    <p>Today we can meet that military challenge, but we cannot be sure of
                        countering the future military threat unless our Alliance modernizes its
                        forces and adds additional military power. In this effort the United States
                        will play its part across the spectrum of conventional, theater nuclear, and
                        strategic nuclear forces. I’m gratified that America’s allies are joining
                        with us in building up their military might.</p>
                    <p>In the past year the United States has increased substantially its
                        conventional combat strength in Europe and is enhancing its capability <pb
                            n="403" facs="0444" xml:id="pg_403"/>for rapid deployment of additional
                        forces to that continent. United States theater nuclear forces are being
                        modernized, and the United States will maintain strategic nuclear
                        equivalence with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Our Alliance centers on Europe, but our vigilance cannot be limited just to
                        that continent. In recent years expanding Soviet power has increasingly
                        penetrated beyond the North Atlantic area.</p>
                    <p>As I speak today, the activities of the Soviet Union and Cuba in Africa are
                        preventing individual nations from determining their own future. As members
                        of the world’s greatest alliance, we cannot be indifferent to these events
                        because of what they mean for Africa and because of their effect on the
                        long-term interests of the Alliance itself.</p>
                    <p>I welcome the efforts of individual <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>

                    <p>Our Alliance has never been an end in itself. It is a way to promote
                        stability and peace in Europe and, indeed, peace in the world at large.</p>
                    <p>Our strength has made possible the pursuit of détente and agreements to limit
                        arms, while increasing the security of the Alliance. Defense in Europe,
                        East-West détente, and global diplomacy all go hand in hand. Never before
                        has a defensive alliance devoted so much effort to negotiate limitations and
                        reductions in armaments with its potential adversaries. Our record has no
                        equal in the search for effective arms control agreements.</p>
                    <p>The United States continues to move forward in its negotiations with the
                        Soviet Union on a new agreement to limit and reduce strategic nuclear
                        weapons. Our objective is to preserve and advance the security of all the
                        members of our Alliance. We will continue to consult and to work closely
                        with our allies to ensure that arms control efforts serve our common
                        needs.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Allies are also working for the
                        mutual and balanced reduction of forces in Europe to provide greater
                        security for all European peoples at lower levels of armaments, lower
                        tensions, and at lower costs. The Allies have recently made a new proposal
                        to the Warsaw Pact, and we call upon those nations to respond in the
                        positive spirit in which our offer was made.</p>
                    <pb n="404" facs="0445" xml:id="pg_404"/>
                    <p>Our efforts to reduce weapons and forces in both these negotiations are
                        guided by the need for equivalence and balance in the military capabilities
                        of the East and West. That is the only enduring basis for promoting security
                        and peace.</p>
                    <p>The challenges we face as allies do not end here. Economic changes within our
                        countries and throughout the world have increased our dependence upon one
                        another and complicated our efforts to promote economic and social welfare
                        for our people.</p>
                    <p>Social changes generated partly by economic and political progress will
                        require creative thought and effort by each of our nations. Our Alliance
                        derives additional strength through our shared goals and experiences.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we face the challenge of promoting the human values and human rights
                        that are the final purpose and meaning of our Alliance. The task is not
                        easy—the way to liberty has never been—but our nations preeminently comprise
                        the region of the world where freedom finds its most hospitable
                        environment.</p>
                    <p>As we seek to build détente, therefore, we must continue to seek full
                        implementation by Warsaw Pact countries as well as our own of the Helsinki
                        accords on security and cooperation in Europe that was signed 3 years
                        ago.</p>
                    <p>If we continue to build on the fundamental strength of the North Atlantic
                        Alliance, I am confident that we can meet any challenge in the years ahead.
                        In the future, as in the past, the Government and people of the United
                        States will remain steadfast to our commitment to peace and freedom that all
                        of us as allies share together.</p>
                    <p>Thank you very much.</p>

                        very constructive week. It has involved the conjunction of four important
                        developments:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> countries</hi> displayed more
                        unity on vital matters than expected, and I have not the slightest doubt
                        that they also gained a great deal of personal confidence in your
                        leadership. In fact, I think the Summit has been an important personal
                        success for you;<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2">See <ref target="#d83">Document

                    </p>
                    <p>2. For the first time, <hi rend="italic">the Soviets and the Cubans</hi> are
                        beginning to take our concerns about their African policies seriously. Till
                        now, they have dismissed them; they are now beginning to show signs of
                        genuine concern;</p>
                    <p>3. Similarly for the first time, the <hi rend="italic">Chinese</hi> are
                        beginning to take us seriously, and this could pay dividends in the longer
                        run. In part, this is due to my visit; more importantly, to your public
                        statements and posture;</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The public</hi> is beginning to perceive this
                        Administration as realistically prepared to face the realities of global
                        power. I consider Tuesday’s editorial in <hi rend="italic">The Washington
                            Post</hi> to be particularly significant,<note n="3" xml:id="d84fn3">“A
                            Long-Haul Foreign Policy,” <hi rend="italic">The Washington Post,</hi>
                            May 30, 1978, p. A–16.</note> as was <persName corresp="#p_GME_1">Meg
                            Greenfield</persName>’s column in <hi rend="italic">Newsweek</hi>. I
                        believe you will be hearing significant echoes of Congressional support in
                        the days to come, and this will not be without its domestic political
                        effects.</p>
                    <p>It is essential that these benefits not be dissipated but be exploited
                        towards positive ends. Let me specifically suggest the following:</p>
                    <p>1. That you take advantage of an early opportunity to stress that <hi
                            rend="italic">detente has to be reciprocal and comprehensive</hi>. The
                        issue is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> detente itself, but the Soviet violation
                        of the code of detente. This lesson has to be driven home in a responsible
                        and persistent way.</p>
                    <p>2. It is essential that we do not convey the impression of uncertainty or
                        anxiety. Premature whispers to the Russians about our desire <pb n="406"
                            facs="0447" xml:id="pg_406"/>to promote friendship might be misconstrued
                        by them as an indication of <hi rend="italic">a new zig-zag</hi> and as
                        evidence of lack of resolve. It would be useful if you were to indicate to
                        State your determination that the Administration cohesively convey the same
                        tone—a point which <hi rend="italic">The Washington Post</hi> editorial so
                        well stressed and so much welcomed.</p>
                    <p>3. It should be made clear to the Russians that our purpose is <hi
                            rend="italic">not to humiliate them</hi>, and that we are prepared to
                        deal with them seriously, on the basis of <hi rend="italic"
                        >reciprocity</hi>. Accordingly, I think it would be useful if you were to
                        instruct Cy and me to have separate talks with <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1"
                            >Gromyko</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName>
                        respectively, or each alone with <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1"
                            >Dobrynin</persName>—in order to convey the same message. That message
                        ought to be that we are still interested in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss>, etc., but that we cannot sustain a selective detente
                        which they exploit to their own advantage in a manner inimical to our vital
                        interests; and that any positive gesture by them would be reciprocated by
                        us. For example, tangible even if quiet steps to reduce the Soviet/Cuban
                        military presence in Africa (notably Ethiopia and Angola), and a commitment
                        not to exacerbate the situation around Rhodesia would be reciprocated by us.
                        On the other hand, Soviet unwillingness to give us these assurances will
                        necessarily force us not only to support our friends but also to seek
                        friends where we can find them (and here the China alternative is a very
                        subtle but persuasive argument).</p>
                    <p>4. In regard to China, we should be very careful to continue stressing the
                        proposition that our long-term interests are congruent not because of
                        tactical anti-Sovietism, but <hi rend="italic">because of our joint
                            commitment to a world of diversity</hi> (a point I stressed in my report
                        to <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>).<note n="4" xml:id="d84fn4"
                            >During the summit meeting, <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> delivered a report on China. (<hi
                                rend="italic">Power and Principle,</hi> p. 221)</note> Subtle hints
                        of long-term congruence of interest are more likely to induce the Russians
                        to compete for our favors.</p>
                    <p>Above all, what we now need is to demonstrate prudent resolve so that the
                        four gains mentioned at the outset of this memorandum are translated into

                        public—and the world—need to be reminded that what is involved is “a long
                        haul” policy—not a series of either quick fixes or dramatic shifts.<note

                        the framework for your specific policies, and reassure all concerned that

                    <p>Anything you say will be scanned most carefully for “soft” or “hard” signals,

                        national future—is the Soviet inclination to exploit global turbulence for
                        shortsighted gains, while engaging in a massive military buildup which
                        increasingly gives it additional political leverage. This challenge must be
                        confronted in a responsible way, which is neither alarmist nor

                        <salute>Dear Mr. President:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>As you requested, I am writing to provide material to supplement my letter of
                        May 29, 1978,<note n="2" xml:id="d86fn2">See <ref target="#d82">Document
                                82</ref>.</note> for possible use in your Annapolis speech. In doing
                        so, I will try to minimize repetition of points made in the letter.</p>
                    <p rend="center">I.</p>
                    <p>The United States and the Soviet Union each face a strategic choice—do we
                        want to seek broadened areas of mutual interest as we compete in other
                        areas, or will we revert to the days of general antagonism? We prefer the
                        former course. It means a safer world and a more secure America. A
                        relationship of this kind would include the following elements:</p>
                    <p>A. We would expand areas of cooperation in our mutual interest, such as arms
                        control agreements that enhance our security, or agreements for cooperation
                        in science and technology which promise a better life for our people.</p>
                    <p>B. We would recognize and accept the continuation of competition, but within
                        moderating limits. The American people should not expect, in this
                        generation, to see an end to competition with the Soviets. We, too, will
                        compete ideologically, politically and economically. But both sides should
                        be fully aware of the dangers, to their bilateral relationship and to world
                        peace, if they fuel local and regional conflicts, rather than work together
                        and with others on peaceful solutions.</p>
                    <pb n="409" facs="0450" xml:id="pg_409"/>
                    <p>Soviet and Cuban actions in Africa have exacerbated conflicts and increased
                        bloodshed. No one quarrels with the right of a country to appeal to friendly
                        powers for assistance in maintaining territorial integrity. We have helped
                        meet that call from Zaire. But such help should be coupled with a commitment
                        to the peaceful resolution of disputes. And it should not be a pretext for
                        prolonged military intervention and political dominance.</p>
                    <p>We call on the Soviet Union to adopt a policy of restraint in Africa,
                        forsaking the temptation to achieve short-term political gain at the expense
                        of long-term stability. We also call on the Soviet Union to play a
                        constructive part in finding peaceful solutions for the future of Eritrea
                        and for the remaining problems of decolonization and majority rule in
                        Zimbabwe and Namibia.</p>
                    <p>Competition in areas like Africa will not deter our efforts to find
                        agreements that serve the security interests of both countries. But when
                        peaceful competition turns to confrontation, it cannot help but erode the
                        political base for cooperation in both nations. This is not a threat, but a
                        fact of life. Our intention is not to gain an advantage, but to try to head
                        off a deterioration in our relations that would follow a continued pattern
                        of excessive competition.</p>
                    <p>C. We would also expect the continuation of strong defenses on both sides,
                        and the maintenance of the military parity. Despite the Soviet build-up over
                        the past ten years, the United States and our Allies are strong, and fully
                        equal to the challenge we face.</p>
                    <p>D. Support for human rights, not as an effort to undermine governments, but
                        to uphold an international standard to which both nations are committed.</p>
                    <p rend="center">II.</p>
                    <p>As we cooperate and compete, we must also remain strong. This will
                        include:</p>
                    <p>A. Demonstrated resolve not to allow any nation to gain military superiority
                        over us. This will involve the strengthening of vital military programs in
                        the U.S. and its Allies, as we are doing.</p>
                    <p>B. Achievement of dependable arms control agreements that enhance our
                        security.</p>
                    <p>C. Public and Congressional support for efforts to assist old and new friends
                        in need of security or economic assistance.</p>
                    <p>D. Maintenance of an American leadership that recognizes the necessity of
                        working with other nations, and that acknowledges the desire of many
                        developing nations to preserve real sovereignty and independence, and to
                        resist an unhealthy overdependence on either the United States or the Soviet
                        Union.</p>
                    <pb n="410" facs="0451" xml:id="pg_410"/>
                    <p>E. The continued assertion of our national ideals, the most powerful ideas in
                        the world.</p>
                    <p>F. Our superior technological capacity, our unmatched industrial base, our
                        expanding trade relations around the world.</p>
                    <p>G. The cohesion of our society, and our ability to criticize our shortcomings
                        openly, and in a constructive spirit, so as to better correct them.</p>
                    <p rend="center">III.</p>
                    <p>We are determined to pursue policies of unsurpassed readiness and cooperation
                        in managing our relations with the Soviet Union. No issue is more central to
                        the foreign interests of the United States, and none is nearly as important
                        in assessing the strategic and nuclear threats to world peace. Our views
                        must be made clear to the people of this country and of the Soviet Union,
                        and they will be. But effective diplomacy can suffer if the tone of public
                        debates between our governments is heated. The resulting atmosphere makes it
                        less likely that firm positions quietly conveyed will be fully understood by
                        the other side.</p>
                    <p>Providence has destined that both the United States and the Soviet Union are
                        great powers with global interests. Although we do not share a similar world
                        view, neither should seek to impose its conceptions on others or to exclude
                        the other from constructive participation in the issues that face mankind.
                        We are confident of our future and our ability to help build a world at
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>Taken together with the May 29 letter, I hope that these points may be
                        helpful.</p>

                            speech, tough but well-balanced.” (<hi rend="italic">White House
                                Diary,</hi> p. 199) In his diary entry for June 7, the President
                            noted: “Reaction to the Soviet speech [at the Naval Academy] was good.
                            It will provide a benchmark for our decisions in the future, and we’ve
                            sent a copy of the speech to the State Department and all our embassies
                            with the points to be emphasized. Most reporters played it tough, which
                            is good. If it’s tough at home and the Soviets consider it mild, that’s
                            perfect.” (Ibid.)</note>

                    <p>[Omitted here are the President’s introductory remarks.]</p>
                    <p>Today I want to discuss one of the most important aspects of that
                        international context—the relationship between the world’s two greatest
                        powers, the United States of America and the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>We must realize that for a very long time our relationship with the Soviet
                        Union will be competitive. That competition is to be constructive if we are
                        successful. Instead it could be dangerous and politically disastrous. Then
                        our relationship must be cooperative as well.</p>
                    <p>We must avoid excessive swings in the public mood in our country—from
                        euphoria when things are going well, to despair when they are not; from an
                        exaggerated sense of compatibility with the Soviet Union, to open
                        expressions of hostility.</p>
                    <p>Détente between our two countries is central to world peace. It’s important
                        for the world, for the American public, and for you as future leaders of the
                        Navy to understand the complex and sensitive nature.</p>
                    <p>The word “détente” can be simplistically defined as “the easing of tension
                        between nations.” The word is in practice however, further defined by
                        experience, as those nations evolve new means by which they can live with
                        each other in peace.</p>
                    <p>To be stable, to be supported by the American people, and to be a basis for
                        widening the scope of cooperation, then détente must be broadly defined and
                        truly reciprocal. Both nations must exercise restraint in troubled areas and
                        in troubled times. Both must honor meticulously those agreements which have
                        already been reached to widen cooperation, naturally and mutually limit
                        nuclear arms production, permit the free movement of people and the
                        expression of ideas, and to protect human rights.</p>
                    <pb n="412" facs="0453" xml:id="pg_412"/>
                    <p>Neither of us should entertain the notion that military supremacy can be
                        attained, or that transient military advantage can be politically
                        exploited.</p>
                    <p>Our principal goal is to help shape a world which is more responsive to the
                        desire of people everywhere for economic well-being, social justice,
                        political self-determination, and basic human rights.</p>
                    <p>We seek a world of peace. But such a world must accommodate diversity—social,
                        political, and ideological. Only then can there be a genuine cooperation
                        among nations and among cultures.</p>
                    <p>We desire to dominate no one. We will continue to widen our cooperation with
                        the positive new forces in the world.</p>
                    <p>We want to increase our collaboration with the Soviet Union, but also with
                        the emerging nations, with the nations of Eastern Europe, and with the
                        People’s Republic of China. We are particularly dedicated to genuine
                        self-determination and majority rule in those areas of the world where these
                        goals have not yet been attained.</p>
                    <p>Our long-term objective must be to convince the Soviet Union of the
                        advantages of cooperation and of the costs of disruptive behavior.</p>
                    <p>We remember that the United States and the Soviet Union were allies in the
                        Second World War. One of the great historical accomplishments of the U.S.
                        Navy was to guide and protect the tremendous shipments of armaments and
                        supplies from our country to Murmansk and to other Soviet ports in support
                        of a joint effort to meet the Nazi threat.</p>
                    <p>In the agony of that massive conflict, 20 million Soviet lives were lost.
                        Millions more who live in the Soviet Union still recall the horror and the
                        hunger of that time.</p>
                    <p>I’m convinced that the people of the Soviet Union want peace. I cannot
                        believe that they could possibly want war.</p>
                    <p>Through the years, our Nation has sought accommodation with the Soviet Union,
                        as demonstrated by the Austrian Peace Treaty,<note n="2" xml:id="d87fn2"

                        satellites in space, an agreement to stabilize the level of force deployment
                        in the Indian Ocean, and increased trade and scientific and cultural
                        exchange. We must be willing to explore such avenues of cooperation despite
                        the basic issues which divide us. The risks of nuclear war alone propel us
                        in this direction.</p>
                    <p>The numbers and destructive potential of nuclear weapons has been increasing
                        at an alarming rate. That is why a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        agreement which enhances the security of both nations is of fundamental
                        importance. We and the Soviet Union are negotiating in good faith almost
                        every day, because we both know that a failure to succeed would precipitate
                        a resumption of a massive nuclear arms race.</p>
                    <p>I’m glad to report to you today that the prospects for a <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II agreement are good.</p>
                    <p>Beyond this major effort, improved trade and technological and cultural
                        exchange are among the immediate benefits of cooperation between our two
                        countries. However, these efforts to cooperate do not erase the significant
                        differences between us.</p>
                    <p>What are these differences?</p>
                    <p>To the Soviet Union, détente seems to mean a continuing aggressive struggle
                        for political advantage and increased influence in a variety of ways. The
                        Soviet Union apparently sees military power and military assistance as the
                        best means of expanding their influence abroad. Obviously, areas of
                        instability in the world provide a tempting target for this effort, and all
                        too often they seem ready to exploit any such opportunity.</p>
                    <p>As became apparent in Korea, in Angola, and also, as you know, in Ethiopia
                        more recently, the Soviets prefer to use proxy forces to achieve their
                        purposes.</p>
                    <p>To other nations throughout the world, the Soviet military buildup appears to
                        be excessive, far beyond any legitimate requirement to de<pb n="414"
                            facs="0455" xml:id="pg_414"/>fend themselves or to defend their allies.
                        For more than 15 years, they have maintained this program of military
                        growth, investing almost 15 percent of their total gross national product in
                        armaments, and this sustained growth continues.</p>
                    <p>The abuse of basic human rights in their own country, in violation of the
                        agreement which was reached at Helsinki, has earned them the condemnation of
                        people everywhere who love freedom. By their actions, they’ve demonstrated
                        that the Soviet system cannot tolerate freely expressed ideas or notions of
                        loyal opposition and the free movement of peoples.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union attempts to export a totalitarian and repressive form of
                        government, resulting in a closed society. Some of these characteristics and
                        goals create problems for the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Outside a tightly controlled bloc, the Soviet Union has difficult political
                        relations with other nations. Their cultural bonds with others are few and
                        frayed. Their form of government is becoming increasingly unattractive to
                        other nations, so that even Marxist-Leninist groups no longer look on the
                        Soviet Union as a model to be imitated.</p>
                    <p>Many countries are becoming very concerned that the nonaligned movement is
                        being subverted by Cuba, which is obviously closely aligned with the Soviet
                        Union and dependent upon the Soviets for economic sustenance and for
                        military and political guidance and direction.</p>
                    <p>Although the Soviet Union has the second largest economic system in the
                        world, its growth is slowing greatly, and its standard of living does not
                        compare favorably with that of other nations at the same equivalent stage of
                        economic development.</p>
                    <p>Agricultural production still remains a serious problem for the Soviet Union,
                        so that in times of average or certainly adverse conditions for crop
                        production, they must turn to us or turn to other nations for food
                        supplies.</p>
                    <p>We in our country are in a much more favorable position. Our industrial base
                        and our productivity are unmatched. Our scientific and technological
                        capability is superior to all others. Our alliances with other free nations
                        are strong and growing stronger, and our military capability is now and will
                        be second to none.</p>
                    <p>In contrast to the Soviet Union, we are surrounded by friendly neighbors and
                        wide seas. Our societal structure is stable and cohesive, and our foreign
                        policy enjoys bipartisan public support, which gives it continuity.</p>
                    <p>We are also strong because of what we stand for as a nation: the realistic
                        chance for every person to build a better life; protection by both law and
                        custom from arbitrary exercise of government power; the right of every
                        individual to speak out, to participate fully in government, <pb n="415"
                            facs="0456" xml:id="pg_415"/>and to share political power. Our
                        philosophy is based on personal freedom, the most powerful of all ideas, and
                        our democratic way of life warrants the admiration and emulation by other
                        people throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>Our work for human rights makes us part of an international tide, growing in
                        force. We are strengthened by being part of it.</p>
                    <p>Our growing economic strength is also a major political factor, potential
                        influence for the benefit of others. Our gross national product exceeds that
                        of all nine nations combined in the European Economic Community and is twice
                        as great as that of the Soviet Union. Additionally, we are now learning how
                        to use our resources more wisely, creating a new harmony between our people
                        and our environment.</p>
                    <p>Our analysis of American military strength also furnishes a basis for
                        confidence. We know that neither the United States nor the Soviet Union can
                        launch a nuclear assault on the other without suffering a devastating
                        counterattack which could destroy the aggressor nation. Although the Soviet
                        Union has more missile launchers, greater throw-weight, and more continental
                        air defense capabilities, the United States has more warheads, generally
                        greater accuracy, more heavy bombers, a more balanced nuclear force, better
                        missile submarines, and superior antisubmarine warfare capability.</p>
                    <p>A successful <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II agreement will give
                        both nations equal but lower ceilings on missile launchers and also on
                        missiles with multiple warheads. We envision in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> III an even greater mutual reduction in nuclear
                        weapons.</p>
                    <p>With essential nuclear equivalence, relative conventional force strength has
                        now become more important. The fact is that the military capability of the
                        United States and its allies is adequate to meet any foreseeable threat.</p>
                    <p>It is possible that each side tends to exaggerate the military capability of
                        the other. Accurate analyses are important as a basis for making decisions
                        for the future. False or excessive estimates of Soviet strength or American
                        weakness contributes to the effectiveness of the Soviet propaganda
                        effort.</p>
                    <p>For example, recently alarming news reports of the military budget proposals
                        for the U.S. Navy ignored the fact that we have the highest defense budget
                        in history and that the largest portion of this will go to the Navy.</p>
                    <p>You men are joining a long tradition of superior leadership, seamanship,
                        tactics, and ship design. And I’m confident that the U.S. Navy has no peer,
                        no equal, on the high seas today, and that you, I, and others will always
                        keep the Navy strong.</p>
                    <p>Let there be no doubt about our present and future strength. This brief
                        assessment which I’ve just made shows that we need not be overly <pb n="416"
                            facs="0457" xml:id="pg_416"/>concerned about our ability to compete and
                        to compete successfully. Certainly there is no cause for alarm. The healthy
                        self-criticism and the free debate which are essential in a democracy should
                        never be confused with weakness or despair or lack of purpose.</p>
                    <p>What are the principal elements of American foreign policy to the Soviet
                        Union? Let me outline them very briefly.</p>
                    <p>We will continue to maintain equivalent nuclear strength, because we believe
                        that in the absence of worldwide nuclear disarmament, such equivalency is
                        the least threatening and the most stable situation for the world.</p>
                    <p>We will maintain a prudent and sustained level of military spending, keyed to
                        a stronger <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, more mobile forces, and
                        undiminished presence in the Pacific. We and our allies must and will be
                        able to meet any foreseeable challenge to our security from either strategic
                        nuclear forces or from conventional forces. America has the capability to
                        honor this commitment without excessive sacrifice on the part of our
                        citizens, and that commitment to military strength will be honored.</p>
                    <p>Looking beyond our alliances, we will support worldwide and regional
                        organizations which are dedicated to enhancing international peace, like the
                        United Nations, the Organization of American States, and the Organization
                        for African Unity.</p>
                    <p>In Africa we and our African friends want to see a continent that is free of
                        the dominance of outside powers, free of the bitterness of racial injustice,
                        free of conflict, and free of the burdens of poverty and hunger and disease.
                        We are convinced that the best way to work toward these objectives is
                        through affirmative policies that recognize African realities and that
                        recognize aspirations.</p>
                    <p>The persistent and increasing military involvement of the Soviet Union and
                        Cuba in Africa could deny this hopeful vision. We are deeply concerned about
                        the threat to regional peace and to the autonomy of countries within which
                        these foreign troops seem permanently to be stationed. That is why I’ve
                        spoken up on this subject today. And this is why I and the American people
                        will support African efforts to contain such intrusion, as we have done
                        recently in Zaire.<note n="9" xml:id="d87fn9">See <ref target="#d83fn4"
                                >footnote 4, Document 83</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I urge again that all other powers join us in emphasizing works of peace
                        rather than the weapons of war. In their assistance to Africa, let the
                        Soviet Union now join us in seeking a peaceful and a speedy transition to
                        majority rule in Rhodesia and in Namibia. Let us see efforts to resolve
                        peacefully the disputes in Eritrea and in Angola. Let us all <pb n="417"
                            facs="0458" xml:id="pg_417"/>work, not to divide and to seek domination
                        in Africa, but to help those nations to fulfill their great potential.</p>
                    <p>We will seek peace, better communication and understanding, cultural and
                        scientific exchange, and increased trade with the Soviet Union and with
                        other nations.</p>
                    <p>We will attempt to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons among those
                        nations not now having this capability.</p>
                    <p>We will continue to negotiate constructively and persistently for a fair
                        strategic arms limitation agreement. We know that no ideological victories
                        can be won by either side by the use of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>We have no desire to link this negotiation for a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> agreement with other competitive relationships nor to
                        impose other special conditions on the process. In a democratic society,
                        however, where public opinion is an integral factor in the shaping and
                        implementation of foreign policy, we do recognize that tensions, sharp
                        disputes, or threats to peace will complicate the quest for a successful
                        agreement. This is not a matter of our preference but a simple recognition
                        of fact.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union can choose either confrontation or cooperation. The United
                        States is adequately prepared to meet either choice.</p>
                    <p>We would prefer cooperation through a détente that increasingly involves
                        similar restraint for both sides; similar readiness to resolve disputes by
                        negotiations, and not by violence; similar willingness to compete
                        peacefully, and not militarily. Anything less than that is likely to
                        undermine détente. And this is why I hope that no one will underestimate the
                        concerns which I have expressed today.</p>
                    <p>A competition without restraint and without shared rules will escalate into
                        graver tensions, and our relationship as a whole with the Soviet Union will
                        suffer. I do not wish this to happen, and I do not believe that Mr. Brezhnev
                        desires it. And this is why it is time for us to speak frankly and to face
                        the problems squarely.</p>
                    <p>By a combination of adequate American strength, of quiet self-restraint in
                        the use of it, of a refusal to believe in the inevitability of war, and of a
                        patient and persistent development of all the peaceful alternatives, we hope
                        eventually to lead international society into a more stable, more peaceful,
                        and a more hopeful future.</p>
                    <p>You and I leave here today to do our common duty—protecting our Nation’s
                        vital interests by peaceful means if possible, by resolute action if
                        necessary. We go forth sobered by these responsibilities, but confident of
                        our strength. We go forth knowing that our Nation’s goals—peace, security,
                        liberty for ourselves and for others—will determine our future and that we
                        together can prevail.</p>
                    <p>To attain these goals, our Nation will require exactly those qualities of
                        courage, self-sacrifice, idealism, and self-discipline which you <pb n="418"
                            facs="0459" xml:id="pg_418"/>as midshipmen have learned here at
                        Annapolis so well. That is why your Nation expects so much of you, and that
                        is why you have so much to give.</p>
                    <p>I leave you now with my congratulations and with a prayer to God that both
                        you and I will prove worthy of the task that is before us and the Nation
                        which we have sworn to serve.</p>

                    <p>I am honored to be with you today to talk about U.S. policy toward Asia and
                        I’m particularly delighted to have once again the opportunity to visit
                        Hawaii, a State which symbolizes the U.S. role as a Pacific nation with
                        vital security and economic interests stretching far into Asia. Today, I
                        would like to go beyond that truism and discuss with you how the United
                        States, and particularly these 13 Western States, relate to the emerging
                        Pacific community.</p>
                    <p>Most Americans, especially on the eastern seaboard, first look east toward
                        the great nations of Europe. They see Asia as far away and rather exotic.
                        But, in fact, the Far East is not very far any more. It took me about 12
                        hours to fly here from Washington, but I would need only 7 more to go on to
                        Tokyo. The tip of the Aleutian Islands of the State of Alaska extends as far
                        west into the Pacific as New Zealand and is as close to Japan as Kansas City
                        is to San Francisco. Asian Russia is visible across the Bering Strait from
                        Alaska. The Sun first shines on American territory each day in Guam, which
                        is much closer to Singapore than to San Francisco.</p>
                    <p>The Pacific is at once a transportation route, a source of national
                        resources, including food and energy, and the locus of much of the world’s
                        population. More ominously, because of its strategic and commercial
                        importance, the Pacific is an area of potential conflict. Our last <pb
                            n="419" facs="0460" xml:id="pg_419"/>three wars began in Asia, and the
                        only foreign attacks on American soil since 1812 occurred in the
                        Pacific.</p>
                    <p>Another important dimension of America’s Asian character is of particular
                        significance to the Western States—the cultural and ethnic bonds provided by
                        the people who have immigrated here from the Orient. Asian-Americans have
                        contributed to all aspects of American life since the middle of the last
                        century. In the States which you represent, over 2 million people, or about
                        5½% of the population, claim an Asian heritage. Our host State of Hawaii
                        provides one of the best examples of the influence and role of
                        Asian-Americans in our society.</p>
                    <p>While the fundamental nature of our nation’s involvement in Asia and the
                        Pacific is timeless, we have already entered a new era in the region, and it
                        is time to recognize it. It is an era filled with hope and the promise of
                        stability, prosperity, and the emergence of a genuine Pacific community. But
                        this hope can be realized and the promise fulfilled only if the United
                        States plays a major economic role and fulfills its responsibility to help
                        maintain the strategic balance.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Adjusting to Circumstances</p>
                    <p>Our policy objectives are thus clear. To achieve them requires some
                        adjustment to the changed circumstances we now find in Asia. What are some
                        of these changes? What are the new perspectives?</p>
                    <p>The fall of Saigon marked the end of a 30-year period of history that began
                        with the collapse of the European and Japanese colonial empires in Asia
                        between 1944 and 1954. Playing a remarkable new role in world affairs, the
                        United States filled part of the resulting vacuum by supporting heavily many
                        of the new nations of the region, while Communist states were established in
                        China, North Korea, and North Vietnam. In this period, American policy
                        produced some striking successes and many enduring relationships. Our
                        presence allowed many newly independent countries to buy time, time which
                        was often well used. The reconstruction of Japan, the economic miracles in
                        Taiwan and Korea, and the evolution of the members of the Association of
                        South East Asian Nations (<gloss target="#t_ASEAN_1">ASEAN</gloss>) into
                        strong and viable nations are remarkable successes in which we played a
                        major role. But the period also saw our intervention in Indochina, and this
                        triggered the most divisive foreign policy debate the country has ever
                        known, a debate which has left hidden scars and persistent myths among both
                        former “hawks” and former “doves.”</p>
                    <p>But as we debated our proper role in Asia, Asia itself was changing
                        rapidly—and dramatically—and not quite the way many expected it to change. A
                        few years ago, many predicted that, if Vietnam fell, we would be entering a
                        period of declining stability as a voracious Communist monolith rolled over
                        economically weak and politically shaky <pb n="420" facs="0461"
                            xml:id="pg_420"/>non-Communist countries. These smaller wars would beget
                        larger ones until we would be in direct confrontation with one of the
                        superpowers.</p>
                    <p>Reality looks far different. The Communist countries are economically weak
                        and—after sharing common ground against us—are now bitterly divided. The
                        sharpening of the Sino-Soviet split, the Vietnamese-Cambodian border
                        skirmishing, and the recent deterioration of Vietnamese-Chinese relations
                        clearly reveal serious and chronic problems among these countries. The roots
                        of these three rivalries lie deep in the historical and geopolitical
                        realities of Asia. We do not expect them to abate in the foreseeable future.
                        This presents a sharp contrast with the other nations of the region.</p>
                    <p>The forces of regional economic integration are growing. Japan is increasing
                        its trade with the rest of Asia. <gloss target="#t_ASEAN_1">ASEAN</gloss> is
                        successfully engaged in increased economic cooperation through a web of
                        consultations encompassing practically every phase of economic activity. Our
                        two-way trade with <gloss target="#t_ASEAN_1">ASEAN</gloss> in 1977 was over
                        $10 billion. When that is added to our approximately $15 billion in trade
                        with Hong Kong, Korea, and Taiwan, the total is almost as large as our trade
                        with Japan. These countries—whose combined population totals 300 million
                        (more than South America) have achieved between 6% and 11% annual growth in
                            <gloss target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss> over the last 6 years. It is now
                        the only group of countries in the world within which real <gloss
                            target="#t_GNP_1">GNP</gloss>’s are doubling every 7–12 years.</p>
                    <p>As these countries prosper and mature, they will be increasingly looking to
                        U.S. markets for more sophisticated products. To cite an example of
                        particular interest to the Western States, Singapore’s decision to purchase
                        thirteen 747’s and six 727’s from Boeing is the first step in a transaction
                        which will ultimately be worth $900 million.</p>
                    <p>From the standpoint of security, the strategic balance that exists today
                        among the four most powerful countries in the region—China, Japan, the
                        Soviet Union, and the United States—is clearly in our nation’s interests.
                        Although important differences remain with Peking, it is fair to say that
                        the United States, China, and Japan share an interest in maintaining that
                        stability—a significant and hopeful change from the pattern of the past half
                        century in which U.S. Far Eastern policy constantly required us to choose,
                        in effect, between China and Japan. This situation, true only since

                        new opportunities throughout Asia: It is one of our main tasks not to lose
                        these opportunities—which are diplomatic, strategic, political, and
                        economic—through inattention, inaction, or misunderstanding.</p>

                    <p>The face of Asia has changed, and the U.S. role must change as well. Since
                        the outset of the <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>
                        Administration, we have tried to shape U.S. policies to accommodate these
                        new perspectives. U.S. policies and actions seek to maintain the current
                        equilibrium and not allow any single power to achieve a preponderance of
                        influence or military superiority in the region. A new role has been
                        defined—one that does not return us to the inappropriate level of earlier
                        involvement in the internal affairs of the region and yet does not
                        constitute a confusing and destabilizing “abandonment” of Asia.</p>
                    <p>As we began this process and some adjustments took place, some on both sides
                        of the Pacific mistook them to mean a lessening of American concern about
                        Asia or a reduced U.S. priority for the region as a whole. Others concluded
                        from the collapse of Saigon, the closing of U.S. bases in Thailand, and our
                        decision to reduce our military presence in Korea, that the United States
                        was abandoning its strategic and security role in the region.</p>
                    <p>These new myths about U.S. attitudes toward Asia do not square with the
                        reality of our foreign policy and the four basic elements of the
                        Administration’s Asian and Pacific policy.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Military Presence</p>
                    <p>The first essential element is that we are committed to keeping a strong,
                        flexible military presence in the region to help maintain the present
                        balance of power. To emphasize this point, the President sent Vice President

                        continue to play a major role in the region; and with every ally they
                        reaffirmed the American treaty commitments to that country. Consider also
                        the following.</p>
                    <p>• Except for our planned ground troop withdrawals from Korea, we will
                        maintain our current level of military and naval forces in the Pacific. In
                        addition, we will actually increase the number of tactical aircraft in Korea
                        by 20% this year and strengthen other forces by the introduction of several
                        advanced weapons systems within the next few years. This will include
                        Trident nuclear missiles for our submarine fleet, cruise missiles for our
                            <gloss target="#t_B52_1">B–52</gloss>’s, the airborne warning and
                        control <pb n="422" facs="0463" xml:id="pg_422"/>system, and the latest
                        advanced fighter aircraft, such as <gloss target="#t_F14_1">F–14</gloss>’s
                        for our carriers and <gloss target="#t_F15_1">F–15</gloss>’s for Air Force
                        squadrons.</p>
                    <p>• Our combat troop withdrawal from Korea is being conducted in a way that
                        will insure that stability is maintained on the peninsula. As U.S. troops
                        leave, we plan to turn over $800 million in military equipment to bolster
                        South Korean forces in addition to continuing assistance to Korea’s military
                        modernization program. The scheduled departure of our forces has been
                        “backloaded” with only one battalion leaving this year, two more in 1979,
                        and the withdrawal continuing into 1981–82. This careful phasing will give
                        us ample opportunity to assess North Korea’s behavior and will give Seoul
                        time to train and equip its units. Our commitment to the Republic of Korea
                        remains firm. South Korean forces now defend virtually the entire
                        demilitarized zone with the U.S. military comprising only 5% of all forces
                        in the country. We believe that the U.S. division can be withdrawn without
                        jeopardizing the stability which has existed for the past 25 years.</p>
                    <p>• With the agreement of the Philippine Government, and with full regard for
                        Philippine sovereignty, we are committed to maintaining the two important
                        U.S. bases in the Philippines. This will enhance our ability to project U.S.
                        military strength into Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean, the Persian Gulf,
                        and East Africa and to protect Pacific and Indian Ocean shipping lanes over
                        which 90% of Middle Eastern oil is transported.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Relations With Japan</p>
                    <p>The second element of our strategy is our relationship with Japan—still the
                        cornerstone of our Asian policy.<note n="4" xml:id="d88fn4">Japan was
                            featured in the June 1978 BULLETIN, p. 1. [Footnote in the

                        despite serious economic stresses. The depth of commitment that both

                        significant effort has been our joint undertaking to address Japan’s current
                        account surplus which reached $14 billion in 1977. Sparked by efforts of

                    <p>• Establishment of a U.S.-Japan forest products study group to explore ways

                    <p>In addition, Japan has decided to stimulate its domestic demand to absorb
                        production and reduce pressure to export.</p>
                    <p>We are continuing regular discussions with Japan in support of these steps.
                        The Japanese current account surpluses and our bilateral deficits with Japan
                        continue to be large, but we believe that the trend will move in the right
                        direction if both nations remain firmly committed to the goals we have set
                        for ourselves in remedying this serious problem. The Multilateral Trade
                        Negotiations (MTN) are equally important but less visible. Minister

                    <p>The third element in our Asian and Pacific strategy is our commitment to
                        normalizing relations with China. While we do not have a firm timetable, one
                        of President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>’s first actions
                        as President was to reaffirm the Shanghai communique of 1972.<note n="5"

                        agreements with others that are directed against the People’s Republic of
                        China. We recognize and respect China’s strong commitments to independence,
                        unity, and self-reliance.</p>
                    <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>’s trip to China was
                        the most recent affirmation of the importance to both countries of the
                        Washington-Peking relationship. As Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                            >Brzezinski</persName> said in Peking, a strong and secure China is in
                        America’s interest. I accompanied him on his visit and can attest to the
                        fact that it enhanced U.S.-Chinese relations from a long-range strategic
                        point of view.<note n="6" xml:id="d88fn6">See <ref target="#d62fn21"

                    <p>Nevertheless, there is an incompleteness in the relationship which, over
                        time, could render it vulnerable to extraneous factors, raising once again
                        the prospects of needless confrontation or misunderstanding between two
                        major powers. This would deprive us of the opportunity to achieve greater
                        cooperation with China on global and regional issues.</p>

                    <p>Normalization would not solve all of our problems or disagreements, but it
                        would help consolidate our nonconfrontational relationship, and it would
                        help insure that the current balance in the entire region remain intact. We
                        are, therefore, convinced that normalization is an essential objective for
                        our new Asian policy.</p>
                    <p>In pursuing this objective, we are constantly mindful of the well-being of
                        the people of Taiwan. Thus, we are continuing to seek that framework which
                        allows us to move ahead with our strategically and historically important
                        relations with the People’s Republic of China while at the same time taking
                        full account of our concerns regarding Taiwan. Our interest is that whatever
                        solution there may be to the “Taiwan question” that it will be a peaceful
                        one. We are confident that in the future we still would be able to continue
                        the many mutually beneficial relationships which link us to the people of
                        Taiwan.</p>

                    <p>The fourth key element of our post-Vietnam/Asia policy is a strong emphasis
                        on promoting U.S. trade and investment in Asia. Economic relations are now
                        the single most important emerging element of our relationship with Asia,
                        and they must not turn into a one-way flow.</p>
                    <p>Prompted by our large trade deficit with the region, some have argued
                        recently that U.S. trade with Asia is increasingly disadvantageous to the
                        United States. It is our conviction, however, that increasing U.S. exports
                        is the best way to reduce our trade difficulties with Asia. The reason is
                        clear and simple: International Trade and U.S. exports create jobs for
                        Americans.</p>
                    <p>The Department of Commerce estimates that every billion dollars of U.S.
                        exports translates directly into 30,000 American jobs. One out of every
                        three agricultural sector jobs is now export-directed. In the manufacturing
                        sector, one out of every seven jobs is export-related. Thus, our exports to
                        Japan alone in 1977—which totaled $10.5 billion—provided direct employment
                        for 315,000 Americans. Our total exports to all of Asia in 1977 of $20.9
                        billion provided jobs for about 627,000 Americans. But even these figures do
                        not tell the whole story. The Department of Labor estimates that for every
                        job directly involved in the production of items for export, another job is
                        created in an allied or supporting industry.</p>
                    <p>Slow export growth over the last 4 years is second only to energy imports as
                        a cause of the large and destabilizing U.S. trade deficit. Recognizing this,

                    </p>
                    <p>It is here that States play a dramatic and leading role, particularly through
                        export industries and business. More than $20 billion in exports were
                        shipped from the Western States in 1976. California led the entire country
                        by a large margin in the export of manufactured goods with over $8 billion
                        in shipments and over $11 billion in total exports—65% of which went to
                        Asian and Pacific countries. Washington, with over $3 billion in
                        manufacturing exports, also ranked among the top eight States in the nation.
                        Oregon sends 83% of its $1.6 billion in exports to Asia—trade which provides
                        jobs to 11% of Oregon’s work force.</p>
                    <p>Exports are an increasingly important part of the States’ economies. Most of
                        the Western States tripled or quadrupled the dollar value of their exports
                        between 1972 and 1976, with Idaho registering a sixfold increase. Inflation
                        accounted for some of those gains, but there were solid indicators of real
                        gains. For example, the total number of persons employed in manufacturing
                        exports in the Western States almost doubled between 1972 and 1976.</p>
                    <p>The importance of export promotion to the Western States is clear. In Alaska
                        22% of manufacturing employment is related to exports; in Washington, the
                        figure is 12.5%; in Arizona and in Hawaii, it is 11.6%. In California the
                        percentage is lower—7.8% but the absolute numbers are large: 125,000 people
                        are employed in manufacturing exports alone.</p>
                    <p>Export promotion efforts can be helped by informing business constituents
                        that the investment climate in Asia is much improved as well. Following the
                        end of the Vietnam war, the American business community grew less certain
                        about the prospects for maintaining a favorable economic climate in Asia.
                        But now that 3 years have passed, we can see that those fears were
                        exaggerated and unjustified. As a result of the political stability in the
                        market economy countries, there is a tremendous regional market developing
                        that will be increasingly hungry for American quality products and
                        attractive to American capital. Together, utilizing already existing
                        facilities such as the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private
                        Investment Corporation, Federal and State Governments can be important
                        catalysts in helping America increase its share of the lucrative trade and
                        investment markets.</p>
                    <p>The other side to the coin is that the future of the Pacific community is
                        closely tied to the maintenance of open markets in the Western <pb n="426"
                            facs="0467" xml:id="pg_426"/>States. This is true for Japan and for the
                        newly industrializing nations of the region. The latter group, in
                        particular, presents us with new challenges as they are becoming
                        increasingly competitive with us in world markets. We must insure that this
                        competition is conducted according to accepted international trade rules and
                        that we have domestic policies in place to cushion any adjustment costs to
                        our own industries and workers. It is essential to the growth and
                        development of both Asia and the American West to keep our markets open.</p>
                    <p>This is not an easy task for public officials or for the Western businesses
                        and workers that must compete. However, there is hardly anything more
                        important to the future of the advanced developing nations of Asia nor any
                        greater test of our ability to keep open the world economy.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Human Rights</p>
                    <p>There are two humanitarian problems of deep concern—the plight of the
                        Indochina refugees and food shortages. Refugees are still fleeing from
                        Vietnam and the incomprehensible horrors of Cambodia; in fact, at an
                        increasing rate lately. Many set out in rickety boats with few supplies, and
                        estimates are that only half make it to another port. There they often
                        languish in barely adequate conditions in makeshift camps. The Vice
                        President and I were deeply moved by what we saw, and the Vice President
                        reported his findings to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                            >Vance</persName>. Our view is that the United States, with its great
                        humanitarian tradition, cannot turn its back on this continued outflow of
                        people.</p>
                    <p>On June 14 the Administration announced its intention to receive 25,000
                        Indochinese refugees per year.<note n="9" xml:id="d88fn9">See “U.S. Will

                        part, but we call on other nations to join us in an international effort to
                        deal with this tragic situation and to assist in alleviating the burden on
                        the Southeast Asian and Pacific countries who temporarily accommodate
                        Indochinese refugees. Some nations, like France, Australia, Canada have
                        responded well; others have been less helpful.</p>
                    <pb n="427" facs="0468" xml:id="pg_427"/>
                    <p>No other part of our nation has done more than the Western States to assist
                        those already here. Despite the growing dimensions of the problem, I hope
                        that the spirit of American compassion will not allow us to turn our backs
                        on those still in desperate need of help.</p>
                    <p>The Indochina refugee dilemma is the most visible aspect of our human rights
                        efforts. But the drama and urgency of that situation should not obscure the
                        fundamental actions of the United States in promoting the dignity and rights
                        of people in all nations. We will continue to speak out in appropriate
                        fashion when we feel that human dignity is being diminished or those rights
                        abridged, and we believe that real progress has been made in some countries
                        with which we have long had, and intend to maintain, very close ties of
                        friendship.</p>
                    <p>The other humanitarian concern I would like to mention—one long predating the
                        refugee problem—is the state of agriculture, which remains the weakest link
                        in the Asian development scene. Surveys by the Asian Development Bank and
                        the World Bank indicate that improvements in rural living standards in much
                        of non-Communist Asia lag further behind the modernized industrial sector.
                        There are also serious food shortages and nutritional deficiencies in some
                        areas. For example, one-third of last year’s entire world trade in rice—well
                        over 2 million tons—went to Indonesia. This is a genuine cause for
                        concern.</p>
                    <p>In the short term, the United States and other donors can do much to
                        alleviate the food shortages and malnutrition plaguing some Asian countries.
                        In the long run, the answer lies in the development and modernization in the
                        rural economies of Asia. The United States can make a large contribution to
                        this process with carefully directed development programs supported by

                        International Development, support for agricultural development projects
                        sponsored by international lending institutions, and the transfer of
                        appropriate technology and capital to the rural sector. We are working
                        closely with the <gloss target="#t_ASEAN_1">ASEAN</gloss> countries to
                        achieve just this sort of development. Japan is also aiding in this
                        effort.</p>
                    <p>In sum, Asia today presents both challenges and opportunities for Americans.
                        We are an integral part of the process of change in the region because of
                        our history, our geography, and because of shared values and interests. We
                        will always be a power in the region, but we realize that power must be
                        newly defined and redefined as circumstances evolve. In Asia and the
                        Pacific, it now largely means cooperation not only with old friends but, if
                        they wish, with old adversaries. Our interest and involvement in the region
                        will remain, but the shape and size of that involvement will continue to
                        adapt.</p>

                        the constructive role of the United States in the area, and we look forward

                    <p>“There is perhaps no more important question on which we must consult than
                        the entire range of U.S.-Soviet relations. I use the word ’range’ advisedly.
                        For it is very important, as we deal with these critical issues, that we
                        recognize a fundamental reality of this relationship: That it is not a
                        relationship with a single dimension but with many; that even as we have
                        sharp differences, as we inevitably will, there are many other areas in
                        which we continue to cooperate and to seek useful agreement; and that to
                        view U.S.-Soviet relations from the perspective of a single dimension is to
                        run the risk of failing to identify our interests carefully and to act
                        accordingly.”</p>

                        of treaties and agreements crucial to peace and security; and mutual conduct
                        in global affairs. Regarding <pb n="429" facs="0470" xml:id="pg_429"/>this
                        last component, the Secretary suggested that he intended to address it “in
                        its African context, where interest is presently focused.” Commenting that
                        he would devote greater attention to the specifics of the policy in an
                        address the next day, <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>
                        explained that the administration’s strategy “is based upon an affirmative
                        and constructive approach to African issues: helping African nations meet
                        their pressing human and economic needs; strengthening their ability to
                        defend themselves; building closer ties throughout Africa; and assisting
                        African nations to resolve their conflicts peacefully.” (Department of State
                            <hi rend="italic">Bulletin,</hi> August 1978, pages 14 and 15)</p>
                    <p>On June 20, <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> addressed the
                        annual meeting of the U.S. Jaycees, who had convened in Atlantic City, New
                        Jersey. After highlighting the importance of the African continent in human,
                        economic, and political terms, the Secretary referenced his July 1, 1977,
                        address (see <ref target="#d50">Document 50</ref>), noting: “I said that we
                        can be neither right nor effective if we treat Africa simply as an arena for
                        East-West competition. Our Africa policy has not changed. Its objectives
                        remain forward looking and positive.” After summarizing the objectives as
                        ones that prioritized commitment to social and economic justice, resolution
                        of disputes, respect for nationalism, support for defense needs, and respect
                        for human rights, <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> explained
                        how the administration had applied them to issues of the greatest concern in
                        Rhodesia, Namibia, the Horn of Africa, and Zaire. He then discussed the
                        objectives in greater detail:</p>
                    <p>“—We will rely on our strengths—our trade, aid, economic, and cultural
                        ties—which have developed over the years. To these we have added our common
                        commitment to social justice and human development. These are the most
                        enduring elements in the relationship between Africa and America. They bind
                        us to nations throughout the continent.</p>
                    <p>“It is essential to the success of our policies that Africans know that we
                        share their goal of economic development. This means increasing trade and
                        investment in ways that benefit both Africa and the United States. And it
                        means continuing to increase our aid to African nations. We will do so
                        because there is genuine need, because it is important to our own economic
                        well-being, and because it will strengthen the independence of African
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>“—Our strategy is to work with others in Africa and beyond for the peaceful
                        resolution of disputes. We can help African nations avoid human suffering
                        and prevent the diversion of resources from human development. Moreover, a
                        potential conflict resolved is a conflict of which others cannot take
                        advantage. We will help to strengthen the effectiveness of the United
                        Nations and regional organizations such as the Organization of African Unity
                        which can play a vital role in <pb n="430" facs="0471" xml:id="pg_430"
                        />working for peace. Ultimately, it is Africans themselves who will bring
                        peace to their continent.</p>
                    <p>“—We will continue to respect the growing spirit of African national
                        independence because it is important to economic and political progress and
                        because Africans will firmly resist yielding their hard-won independence to
                        outside powers. The history of the last 20 years demonstrates that fact.</p>
                    <p>“—It has been our policy since the beginning of the Administration to
                        consider security requests from African nations with legitimate defense
                        needs. Our friends in Africa must know that we can and will help them to
                        strengthen their ability to defend themselves. Any increase in American
                        military assistance will be done prudently and will be consistent with this
                        Administration’s policy of seeking arms restraint and concentrating our
                        assistance on economic development.</p>
                    <p>“—In private and public, we have emphasized our concern about the nature of
                        Soviet activities in Africa and we have been in contact with European, Arab,
                        and African countries and members of the nonaligned movement who share our
                        concern. We have pointed out to the Soviets the problems which their
                        activities pose for Africa and for our overall relations. Our actions will
                        continue to be consistent with our commitment to the peaceful resolution of
                        disputes and with due regard for the concerns of those African countries
                        affected.</p>
                    <p>“—In Africa as elsewhere, we will work along with others of all races to
                        foster respect for individual human rights. We believe that civil and
                        political liberties and the right of each individual to basic necessities,
                        such as decent health care, education, and food, should be respected
                        throughout the continent.</p>
                    <p>“The strategy we are pursuing is a realistic approach that emphasizes our
                        strengths and encourages an evolution of events that is in both Africa’s
                        interests and our own. It is a strategy that has earned the support of
                        African leaders throughout the continent.</p>
                    <p>“We do not ignore that there is a residue of suspicion among some Africans
                        who have fought against colonialism that our policy is simply a tactic and
                        not a reflection of a genuine commitment to African needs. Only time and our
                        continued demonstration that we mean what we say will meet this problem.</p>
                    <p>“We are convinced that an affirmative approach to African aspirations and
                        problems is also the most effective response to Soviet and Cuban activities
                        there. Any other strategy would weaken Africa by dividing it. And it would
                        weaken us by letting others set our policies for us.</p>
                    <p>“Our nation and the nations of Africa have much in common. We struggled hard
                        for our independence, and we intend to remain free. We <pb n="431"
                            facs="0472" xml:id="pg_431"/>are blessed with great human and natural
                        resources, and we intend to develop them fully. We are committed to racial
                        justice, and we intend to achieve it in our lifetime. And we share a common
                        vision of Africa’s future—where African hopes and dreams for a better life
                        and for peace have become a reality.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic"

                        their aspirations as well as participation require a wider framework. Unlike

                        post-World War II international system, this calls not for a predominantly
                        American response but for more subtle inspiration and cooperative leadership

                        relations; our African policy; the Middle East; and perhaps China.</p>
                    <p>I would suggest the following comments:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">U.S.-Soviet relations:</hi> Our long-term objective
                        remains constant: to prevent the spread of Soviet influence, to reduce the
                        risk of nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union, and to increasingly
                        assimilate the Soviet Union in wider international cooperation. The recent
                        public exchanges were necessary to convince the Soviets that we are serious
                        about our concerns, namely that the Soviet Union is overly inclined to use
                        its growing military power to exert political pressure and particularly to
                        exploit Third World turbulence, thereby preventing moderate solutions to
                        international problems. We have repeatedly tried through private
                        correspondence to convince Brezhnev that we are serious. Your speech
                        reaffirmed our commitment to a detente based increasingly on mutual
                        restraint and on reciprocity.<note n="11" xml:id="d90fn11">See <ref

                        <hi rend="italic">Africa:</hi> Our central objective is the creation of
                        majority rule governments and elimination of racial oppression. At the same
                        time, we want to avoid a situation in which East-West and North-South
                        conflicts intersect. This is precisely why we object so strongly to the
                        Soviet/Cuban intrusion. It makes moderate solutions more difficult to
                        achieve and it runs the risk of transforming difficult regional problems
                        into graver international conflicts. We would like the Africans,
                        particularly acting through the <gloss target="#t_OAU_1">OAU</gloss>, to
                        resolve African problems themselves.</p>

                        disappointment at the recent Israeli response. Any peaceful solution must be
                        based on the complete application of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>

                        committed to normalization, and that in the meantime it is in our mutual
                        benefit to <pb n="436" facs="0477" xml:id="pg_436"/>widen the scope of our

                        ability to negotiate successfully some of the outstanding issues; it also
                        depends on Congressional attitudes, and here asking for their advice may
                        also be the best way to deal with the issue.</p>

                    <p>In four key policy areas—China, the Middle East, Africa, and the Soviet
                        Union—we are at the point where some basic choices need to be made. If we do
                        not make them explicitly and consciously, we are likely to find it more
                        difficult to attain our key objectives.</p>
                    <p>Let me state them very concisely:</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                        <hi rend="roman">A.</hi> China</p>
                    <p>We have embarked on a course that could have very great international
                        consequences. U.S.-Chinese normalization could open the doors to a
                        political-economic relationship with one-fourth of mankind. It could alter
                        the international balance. Success here would be a very major and historic
                        accomplishment for you.</p>
                    <p>However, in seeking it, we should avoid actions that convey to the Chinese
                        insensitivity to their concerns. The issue of Vietnam is very germane here.
                        The Chinese see Vietnam as veering towards the Soviets, and they are
                        genuinely alarmed and outraged. A Soviet presence in Vietnam would provide
                        the Soviets with a strategic springboard, <pb n="437" facs="0478"
                            xml:id="pg_437"/>as threatening to China’s security as are the Soviet
                        forces now in Mongolia.</p>
                    <p>The Vietnamese, probably encouraged by the Soviets, are now making noises
                        about U.S.-Vietnamese normalization. The State Department said yesterday,
                        “Our policy is clear. We are prepared to normalize relations.”<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d91fn2">Reference to press guidance issued by the Department of

                            regard to normalization “is clear. As we have stated at each of the

                            prepared to normalize relations at the diplomatic level and to exchange
                            embassies and ambassadors. Once embassies are in place, we would lift
                            the trade embargo.” (National Archives, <gloss target="#t_RG_1"

                    </p>
                    <p>This willingness comes at the wrong time and in the wrong context. It will
                        reinforce Chinese concerns, and thus needlessly complicate the more
                        important task—normalizing with Peking. You need to choose: Vietnam or
                        China, and China is incomparably more important to us.</p>
                    <p>If you agree, you might wish to have me send a note to the State Department,
                        asking that efforts to normalize relations with Vietnam be postponed until
                        the other issue is resolved.</p>

                    <p>We are nearing a very crucial point: once the U.S. “suggestions” are
                        submitted, we will have no choice but to push with all our resources to
                        obtain a settlement. Without such a settlement it is likely that the
                        situation in the Middle East will deteriorate greatly.</p>
                    <p>The alternative, which the Vice President recommends, is to adopt a less
                        assertive strategy, playing for time and limiting damage to our relations
                        with Israel and with the Jewish community. This course would produce less
                        controversy, and it will be less politically risky. It will also, however,
                        perpetuate the Middle Eastern problem, and thus pose some dangers to
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> himself.</p>
                    <p>If you choose to go ahead, you will face an unavoidable confrontation. Are we
                        ready for it? Do you have the resources to prevail? What specifically can we
                        do to make certain that rejection of our “suggestions” is too costly for the
                        parties concerned? Cy and I are developing some thoughts for you, but only
                        you can decide whether we are prepared for a major confrontation—without
                        which no settlement seems possible—later this summer and probably throughout
                        much of the fall.</p>
                    <p>However, if you do decide to cut the Gordian Knot, a sustained
                        time-commitment by Cy will be needed. The Middle East issue cannot be
                        handled on a part-time basis. Either he will have to give it a <hi

                        will not be overcome on a part-time basis, and endless exercises in drawing
                        up draft declarations are no substitute for direct political negotiations,
                        with someone holding noses to the grindstone.</p>

                    <p>Here we confront three basic choices: (a) the scope of what we negotiate and

                        Soviet involvement in Africa.</p>
                    <p>We should not tie the three issues together, but we should be consistent and
                        firm on each.</p>
                    <p>On negotiations, the key issue which you ought to review is whether the

                    <p>However, this entails a political judgment on which you might prefer to

                    <p>I know that our commitment is to majority rule, and not to any particular
                        individuals or orientation. Yet the <hi rend="italic">perceived</hi> effect
                        of our policy is to favor the left and the guerrillas. Moreover, in Angola,
                        we are beginning to inch up to <persName corresp="#p_NAA_1">Neto</persName>,
                        who does not even command the support of his own people.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the British will succeed in seducing <persName corresp="#p_NJ_1"
                            >Nkomo</persName>—but if they do not, then maybe we should choose to
                        quietly disengage and lower our own direct involvement.<note n="13"
                            xml:id="d91fn13">The President underlined “to quietly engage” and wrote
                            “a good possibility” in the right-hand margin next to the
                            sentence.</note> This will not be a satisfactory outcome, but it may be
                        better than being drawn into a massive conflict between the forces of
                        apartheid and Soviet/Cuban dominated guerrillas.</p>
                    <p>A final thought: our foreign policy till now has been heavily “contractual.”
                        Yet political problems cannot be resolved by patient negotiation of peace
                        contracts or agreements alone. At some point, it is necessary to bring a
                        situation to a head—to have a brief crisis or confrontation even—and then to
                        resolve it, with one’s own forces marshalled in the background to provide
                        the needed sanction or leverage.</p>
                    <p>This is essentially true of the Middle East and of U.S.-Soviet relations. A
                        period of tension with Israel is probably an unavoidable prelude to a
                        settlement; U.S.-Soviet frictions in the past contributed to the development
                        of mutually understood rules of the game governing European affairs and the
                        strategic equation. The same may now be needed regarding human rights and
                        intervention in Third World problems. A period of friction or crisis is not
                        the same thing as a confrontation—and it should not be viewed as mindless
                        advocacy of conflict. But unless some situations are brought to a head, they
                        are likely to fester, with destructive consequences for either regional or
                        international peace. Making the right choice at the critical moment is
                        ultimately the basic test of statesmanship.</p>

                    <p>Having been fortunate enough to make an official state visit to the Federal
                        Republic of Germany immediately prior to the summit conference, I would like
                        to express the thanks, on behalf of all the American delegation, to
                        President <persName corresp="#p_SW_1">Scheel</persName>, to Chancellor
                            <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName>, and to the people of the
                        Federal Republic, for their hospitality.</p>
                    <p>I have been very pleased at the results of this summit conference. The
                        results have exceeded the expectation of all of us. The discussions and the
                        conclusions have been carefully prepared. Each one of us has been cautious
                        at this summit not to promise things which we could not subsequently
                        deliver.</p>
                    <p>The assessments have been long, sometimes tedious, but comprehensive in
                        nature. They are substantive and specific. I think each leader has gone the
                        limit, within the bounds of political actualities, to contribute everything
                        possible from our own individual nations to the common well-being of the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>Our contributions have been mutually supportive. They have been different,
                        one from another, because our capabilities and our needs are different.</p>
                    <p>We have dealt with the very serious problem of protectionism and mutually
                        committed ourselves to successfully concluding the multilateral trade
                        negotiations to permit free markets to keep our people employed at home.</p>
                    <p>The Federal Republic of Germany, the Government of Japan, have generously
                        committed themselves to increased economic growth. Other nations have joined
                        in this commitment. The United States, recognizing our own responsibilities,
                        and at the request of others, have committed ourselves to a comprehensive
                        energy policy and its implementation—to cut down the importation of oil by
                        2½ million barrels a day by the year 1985, to raise the price of oil, which
                        is too cheap in our own country, to the world market level to discourage
                        waste.</p>
                    <pb n="442" facs="0483" xml:id="pg_442"/>
                    <p>We and the Canadians have recognized our need to provide some predictability,
                        some dependability upon a supply of nuclear fuels to other nations,
                        commensurate with a mutual profession against proliferation of nuclear
                        explosives and the adherence to international safeguards.</p>
                    <p>We have all been concerned about inflation and have made our plans to deal
                        with this all-pervasive threat throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>This is a time when we also recognize our strength, our stability, the
                        benefits of peace. And our hope is that in the analysis of transient
                        problems, with which we are trying to deal successfully, that we need not
                        ever lose sight of the base of common purpose that binds us together in a
                        successful endeavor in the free and democratic nations of the world.</p>
                    <p>We will be carefully monitoring progress after this summit adjourns, to make
                        sure that those commitments made in sincerity are not forgotten nor
                        abandoned in the months ahead.</p>
                    <p>I would like to say, finally, that we have not forgotten the developing
                        nations of the world. We are fortunate, we’ve been blessed with economic and
                        political and military strength and with a fine, high standard of living for
                        our own people. We recognize the need to share this with other, less
                        developed countries. And all these cumulative commitments, I think, will be
                        very good and constructive for the entire world economy in the months
                        ahead.</p>
                    <p>I personally believe that the strong statement on controlling air piracy,
                        terrorism, is in itself worth the entire preparation and conduct of the
                        summit. We are determined that this commitment be carried out individually
                        and collectively. And our Foreign Ministers have been instructed immediately
                        to contact other nations around the world without delay, to encourage them
                        to join in with us in this substantive and, I think, adequate move to
                        prevent air hijacking in the future.</p>
                    <p>I leave this summit conference with a resolve to carry out our purposes, to
                        continue our mutual discussions and consultations, and with a new sense of
                        confidence.</p>
                    <p>This has been a very successful meeting among us. The preparation for it was
                        very instructive and educational, and the superb chairmanship of Chancellor
                            <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName> has helped to ensure its
                        success.</p>

                    <p>In our foreign policy we have placed primary emphasis on two different
                        efforts:</p>
                    <p>1. Obtaining Congressional support for major but controversial (and hence
                        politically costly) undertakings;</p>
                    <p>2. Negotiating the resolution of genuinely important issues (notably <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, the Middle East, and Southern
                        Africa).</p>
                    <p>We have done well on the former; we are making some progress on the
                        latter.</p>
                    <p>I believe, however, that we need to engage also to a greater extent in <hi
                            rend="italic">consultations</hi>, the explicit purpose of which is to
                        generate mutual understanding and the implicit consequence of which might be
                        also some greater accommodation with the parties concerned.</p>
                    <p>For example, Andy’s<note n="2" xml:id="d93fn2">

                        success in Africa is based not only on our approach to Rhodesia and Namibia
                        but also on the series of consultative trips he has taken to the region and
                        the rapport he has helped you establish with African leaders. Moreover, I
                        believe it is fair to say that the Chinese would have never agreed to the
                        kind of flexibility and movement that has now developed in our relationship
                        if I had simply put a negotiating proposal before them on the table. Prior
                        to my visit, they were insisting that everything depended on normalization;
                        now they have in effect accepted the segmentation of the relationship into
                        three parts (the process of normalization; the expansion of <hi
                            rend="italic">governmental</hi> bilateral relations; consultations on
                        international issues). But that emerged as a byproduct of prolonged
                        discussions (some 15 hours) on broad subjects, which contributed to greater
                        mutual understanding.</p>
                    <p>I think we need to do that also with the Soviets. <persName

                        some accommodation. We have not done enough of that—and <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> has hinted to me as much. Given
                        the present frictions, an effort to clear the air—but on the basis of
                        firmness regarding those matters which we consider important (notably their
                        military buildup and their conduct in the third world)—is needed.</p>
                    <p>Historically, a phase of friction in U.S.-Soviet relations has contributed to
                        the emergence of new “rules of the game,” regarding either restraint in the
                        use of conventional forces, or on strategic matters, or even regarding
                        espionage. We now need to develop similar understandings regarding restraint
                        and accommodation on such matters as the use of military proxies or direct
                        military intrusion into third world conflicts. But that will require candid
                        and prolonged discussions.</p>
                    <p>In general, our approach has been one in which we have focused on the
                        negotiation of specific issues, in a legal-contractual fashion, somewhat
                        neglecting the need to develop and sustain a political dialogue.</p>
                    <p>I would think that it would be especially useful if you would dispatch
                        periodically Cy, me, Andy, and others—to talk to the principal leaders with
                        whom we are trying to maintain or develop closer relations: this would be
                        flattering even to Giscard, or <persName corresp="#p_SH_1"
                            >Schmidt</persName>, or <persName corresp="#p_FT_1"
                        >Fukuda</persName>—and certainly to the Shah, or <persName
                            corresp="#p_FAAS_1">Fahd</persName>, or Obasanjo, or <persName
                            corresp="#p_DM_1">Desai</persName>; and it would also be useful with
                            <persName corresp="#p_HG_2">Hua</persName>, or <persName
                            corresp="#p_TJB_1">Tito</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GE_2"
                            >Gierek</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CN_1">Ceausescu</persName>,
                        etc. This could supplement your direct personal contact with these leaders,
                        and in some cases could reinforce any ongoing negotiations.</p>
                    <p>From the domestic point of view, doing the above would also convey the
                        feeling that you are <hi rend="italic">deliberately orchestrating</hi> some
                        of the diversity of viewpoints around you on behalf of your strategic goals.
                        Incidentally, the Soviets have long used, and quite effectively, the tactic
                        of occasionally sending “hard” spokesmen to convey a soft message, and
                        “soft” spokesmen to convey a hard message, in order to enhance the
                        credibility of that message, and to show that the “soft” and “hard” options
                        are deliberate instruments of policy and not merely reflections of internal
                        vacillation. <gloss target="#t_FDR_1">FDR</gloss> did some of the same, and
                        it is in your interest to promote also such a perception of yourself.</p>
                    <p>Finally, there is the fact that such consultations—conducted on a regular
                        basis with ten or so top leaders around the world—would reduce some of the
                        foreign misunderstandings and anxieties regarding our policy.</p>
                    <p>Cy is departing tonight for the Middle East where he will, in effect, carry

                        voted with the Administration.</p>
                    <p>Based on the above, here are a few observations:</p>
                    <p>1. The 3 out of 4 votes must be watched most carefully for <hi rend="italic"
                            >defections.</hi> It probably contains many Democrats who think they
                        have done enough and many Republicans who may think they have done too much
                        already.</p>
                    <p>2. We should probably work the most on those who have voted with us half the
                        time. The split seems to be on liberal/conservative lines, based on fairly
                        emotional issues. Less emotional issues may produce different divisions,
                        thus we must work with this group closely.</p>
                    <p>3. Those who never vote with the Administration are clearly doing it for
                        party reasons and are hopeless.</p>
                    <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_BHHJ_1">Baker</persName>’s support and that of the
                        Republicans is what has made up for Democratic defections. It should be
                        noted, however, that the Republican group that supports us shifts and that
                        we won without <persName corresp="#p_BHHJ_1">Baker</persName> on
                        Rhodesia.</p>

                    <p>Recent polls indicate that a majority of Americans are now dissatisfied with
                        how U.S. military power compares to that of the Soviet Union. The proportion
                        of the public feeling such dissatisfaction has been rising since late 1976,
                        when it stood at 41 percent. Late this spring, it reached 55 percent.</p>

                        equal”). The increased dissatisfaction with America’s relative military
                        power comes from the increased number who have come to perceive the United
                        States as being weaker than the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>In a poll taken last month, 42 percent of the public said the United States
                        was militarily weaker than the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> (up
                        from 27 percent in late 1976). Only 12 percent said the United States was

                    <p>Two years ago Brezhnev had this to say about the relationship between foreign
                        policy and economic relations: “In foreign economic relations, politics and
                        economics, diplomacy and commerce, industrial production and trade are woven
                        together. Consequently, the approach to them and the management of them must
                        be integrated, tying into one knot the efforts of all departments and, our
                        political and economic interests. This is precisely how the Party’s Central
                        Committee has posed this important question.”</p>

                        and from the world. So they cannot see Africa as an open, unimpeded avenue.
                        Also, in Europe they face the problem of Euro-Communism. And in Eastern Asia

                        perspective, I would feel that what causes us problems also causes him
                        problems. He doesn’t want to see Angola or Cuba or Vietnam or China turn to
                        the West; or have Mozambique turn to us for trade; or to see trade between
                        us and Eastern Europe build up. If I were Brezhnev, I would hate to see
                        these things happen. We have to take advantage of our opportunities and it
                        is for this group to see that we do.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Brown:</hi> The Soviets are not a likable partner. When
                        they get in, they seek to dominate. But if you compare their situation with
                        five years ago, they are better off even if they do have the problems the
                        President cited. Their influence with India, Pakistan and so forth, depends
                        on their military power. They don’t have much in the way of economic power.
                        Though the Soviets do have real worries, they do have levers—above all the
                        military. In all of the places we have talked about, they feel the Soviets
                        are relatively more powerful, vis-a-vis the U.S., than they were five years
                        ago. There is a certain ambivalence in response: for example, it has moved
                        the Europeans to spend more. The Soviets are respected and feared, not
                        loved, but they have options. So the Soviets may have certain apprehensions
                        but do think they are much better off today than they were.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The President:</hi> We should enumerate the areas where we
                        think we have a problem—political, trade, or military influence. We should
                        approach each country or area as a separate question to be addressed.
                        Congress is more aware of the need for peaceful competition with the Soviets
                        than ever before. We should plan our political strategy on this basis and
                        consult with Congress and get them aboard. For example, Mozambique and
                        Angola are good cases for moving. What are others? We need to do this on a
                        country-by-country basis: where we should move, what the problems are, the
                        key Congressional elements to get on board, how to win public approval for
                        our efforts. Our strength should help us. Brezhnev is vulnerable to
                        competition. We have gotten the Allies to go with us. We should explore how
                        we can do this with others.</p>

                        and a U.S. base could be stabilizing. I don’t know if we should do it, or
                        how rapid the Soviet reaction would be. This is one place for a military
                        presence and there may be others in <pb n="451" facs="0492" xml:id="pg_451"
                        />the world. We should publicize our military presence elsewhere in the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>Twelve months of our propaganda against the Cubans in Africa has led to
                        worldwide pressure on them to get out. They are moving out of Ethiopia and
                        it will be hard for them to stay in Angola.</p>
                    <p>Our reputation for weakness, vis-a-vis the Soviets, is not deserved. Many of
                        us are guilty of this. For example, at defense budget time, we tend to play
                        up Soviet military capabilities and downplay our own. When we decided to
                        have a public demonstration of our defense capabilities, the cruise missile
                        test failed. We need a careful public relations effort to show that we are
                        strong militarily as well as economically and politically. We recognize the
                        Soviet buildup, but we are not vulnerable or weak. We have to put all of
                        this into proper perspective and correct the weaknesses we have
                        acknowledged. We have to do this in the defense budget for 1980 and decide
                        what is best for us.</p>

                        we have to make measured responses to the Soviets on the defense level; 2)
                        politically, we are in one of those periods of friction with the Soviets
                        which in the past have tended to produce new rules governing the
                        relationship. The Soviets may learn from the costs they are now incurring,
                        e.g., developments in the non-aligned movement and the Chinese move into
                        Africa and now Europe. So we need to exercise considerable caution in how we
                        handle the Soviets in this period of friction. We should insulate <gloss

                        as we can. But we should be wary of initiatives that invite the Soviets to
                        forget what has happened (the difficulties they have created) and make sure
                        we make them reflect on the political costs of their actions. If we do this
                        it may result, as it has in the past, in greater restraint in their future
                        behavior. We must let them know that Third World turbulence will be with us
                        for a long time and that their relations with us will be affected by how the
                        Soviets behave. I think we are on the right course and we should keep on

                        are military advantages in relation to the region. And a peace agreement in

                            Nation, ladies and gentlemen:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>It’s been more than 2,000 years since there was peace between Egypt and a
                        free Jewish nation. If our present expectations are realized, this year we
                        shall see such peace again.</p>
                    <p>The first thing I would like to do is to give tribute to the two men who made
                        this impossible dream now become a real possibility, the two great leaders
                        with whom I have met for the last 2 weeks at Camp David: first, President
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Anwar Sadat</persName> of Egypt, and the
                        other, of course, is Prime Minister Menahem <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                            >Begin</persName> of the nation of Israel.</p>
                    <p>I know that all of you would agree that these are two men of great personal
                        courage, representing nations of peoples who are deeply grateful to them for
                        the achievement which they have realized. And I am personally grateful to
                        them for what they have done.</p>
                    <p>At Camp David, we sought a peace that is not only of vital importance to
                        their own two nations but to all the people of the Middle East, to all the
                        people of the United States, and, indeed, to all the world as well.</p>
                    <p>The world prayed for the success of our efforts, and I am glad to announce to
                        you that these prayers have been answered.</p>
                    <p>I’ve come to discuss with you tonight what these two leaders have
                        accomplished and what this means to all of us.</p>
                    <p>The United States has had no choice but to be deeply concerned about the
                        Middle East and to try to use our influence and our efforts to advance the
                        cause of peace. For the last 30 years, through four wars, the people of this
                        troubled region have paid a terrible price in suffering and division and
                        hatred and bloodshed. No two nations have suffered more <pb n="465"
                            facs="0506" xml:id="pg_465"/>than Egypt and Israel. But the dangers and
                        the costs of conflicts in this region for our own Nation have been great as
                        well. We have longstanding friendships among the nations there and the
                        peoples of the region, and we have profound moral commitments which are
                        deeply rooted in our values as a people.</p>
                    <p>The strategic location of these countries and the resources that they possess
                        mean that events in the Middle East directly affect people everywhere. We
                        and our friends could not be indifferent if a hostile power were to
                        establish domination there. In few areas of the world is there a greater
                        risk that a local conflict could spread among other nations adjacent to them
                        and then, perhaps, erupt into a tragic confrontation between us super powers
                        ourselves.</p>
                    <p>Our people have come to understand that unfamiliar names like Sinai, Aqaba,
                        Sharm el Sheikh, Ras en Naqb, Gaza, the West Bank of Jordan, can have a
                        direct and immediate bearing on our own well-being as a nation and our hope
                        for a peaceful world. That is why we in the United States cannot afford to
                        be idle bystanders and why we have been full partners in the search for
                        peace and why it is so vital to our Nation that these meetings at Camp David
                        have been a success.</p>
                    <p>Through the long years of conflict, four main issues have divided the parties
                        involved. One is the nature of peace—whether peace will simply mean that the
                        guns are silenced, that the bombs no longer fall, that the tanks cease to
                        roll, or whether it will mean that the nations of the Middle East can deal
                        with each other as neighbors and as equals and as friends, with a full range
                        of diplomatic and cultural and economic and human relations between them.
                        That’s been the basic question. The Camp David agreement has defined such
                        relationships, I’m glad to announce to you, between Israel and Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The second main issue is providing for the security of all parties involved,
                        including, of course, our friends, the Israelis, so that none of them need
                        fear attack or military threats from one another. When implemented, the Camp
                        David agreement, I’m glad to announce to you, will provide for such mutual
                        security.</p>
                    <p>Third is the question of agreement on secure and recognized boundaries, the
                        end of military occupation, and the granting of self-government or else the
                        return to other nations of territories which have been occupied by Israel
                        since the 1967 conflict. The Camp David agreement, I’m glad to announce to
                        you, provides for the realization of all these goals.</p>
                    <p>And finally, there is the painful human question of the fate of the
                        Palestinians who live or who have lived in these disputed regions. The Camp
                        David agreement guarantees that the Palestinian people may participate in
                        the resolution of the Palestinian problem in all its aspects, <pb n="466"
                            facs="0507" xml:id="pg_466"/>a commitment that Israel has made in
                        writing and which is supported and appreciated, I’m sure, by all the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>Over the last 18 months, there has been, of course, some progress on these
                        issues. Egypt and Israel came close to agreeing about the first issue, the
                        nature of peace. They then saw that the second and third issues, that is,
                        withdrawal and security, were intimately connected, closely entwined. But
                        fundamental divisions still remained in other areas—about the fate of the
                        Palestinians, the future of the West Bank and Gaza, and the future of
                        Israeli settlements in occupied Arab territories.</p>
                    <p>We all remember the hopes for peace that were inspired by President <persName
                            corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s initiative, that great and historic

                        the world, and by the warm and genuine personal response of Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Begin</persName> and the Israeli people, and
                        by the mutual promise between them, publicly made, that there would be no
                        more war. These hopes were sustained when Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_BM_1">Begin</persName> reciprocated by visiting Ismailia on
                        Christmas Day.<note n="3" xml:id="d96fn3">

                        slower pace through the early part of the year. And by early summer, the
                        negotiations had come to a standstill once again.</p>
                    <p>It was this stalemate and the prospect for an even worse future that prompted
                        me to invite both President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> and
                        Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Begin</persName> to join me at
                        Camp David. They accepted, as you know, instantly, without delay, without
                        preconditions, without consultation even between them.</p>
                    <p>It’s impossible to overstate the courage of these two men or the foresight
                        they have shown. Only through high ideals, through compromises of words and
                        not principle, and through a willingness to look deep into the human heart
                        and to understand the problems and hopes and dreams of one another can
                        progress in a difficult situation like this ever be made. That’s what these
                        men and their wise and diligent advisers who are here with us tonight have
                        done during the last 13 days.</p>
                    <p>When this conference began, I said that the prospects for success were
                        remote. Enormous barriers of ancient history and nationalism and suspicion
                        would have to be overcome if we were to meet our objectives. But President
                            <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> and Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Begin</persName> have overcome these
                        barriers, exceeded our fondest expectations, and have signed two <pb n="467"
                            facs="0508" xml:id="pg_467"/>agreements that hold out the possibility of
                        resolving issues that history had taught us could not be resolved.</p>
                    <p>The first of these documents is entitled, “A Framework for Peace in the
                        Middle East Agreed at Camp David.” It deals with a comprehensive settlement,
                        comprehensive agreement, between Israel and all her neighbors, as well as
                        the difficult question of the Palestinian people and the future of the West
                        Bank and the Gaza area.</p>
                    <p>The agreement provides a basis for the resolution of issues involving the
                        West Bank and Gaza during the next 5 years. It outlines a process of change
                        which is in keeping with Arab hopes, while also carefully respecting
                        Israel’s vital security.</p>
                    <p>The Israeli military government over these areas will be withdrawn and will
                        be replaced with a self-government of the Palestinians who live there. And
                        Israel has committed that this government will have full autonomy. Prime
                        Minister <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Begin</persName> said to me several
                        times, not partial autonomy, but full autonomy.</p>
                    <p>Israeli forces will be withdrawn and redeployed into specified locations to
                        protect Israel’s security. The Palestinians will further participate in
                        determining their own future through talks in which their own elected
                        representatives, the inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza, will negotiate
                        with Egypt and Israel and Jordan to determine the final status of the West
                        Bank and Gaza.</p>
                    <p>Israel has agreed, has committed themselves, that the legitimate rights of
                        the Palestinian people will be recognized. After the signing of this
                        framework last night, and during the negotiations concerning the
                        establishment of the Palestinian self-government, no new Israeli settlements
                        will be established in this area. The future settlements issue will be
                        decided among the negotiating parties.</p>
                    <p>The final status of the West Bank and Gaza will be decided before the end of
                        the 5-year transitional period during which the Palestinian Arabs will have
                        their own government, as part of a negotiation which will produce a peace
                        treaty between Israel and Jordan specifying borders, withdrawal, all those
                        very crucial issues.</p>
                    <p>These negotiations will be based on all the provisions and the principles of
                        Security Council Resolution 242, with which you all are so familiar. The
                        agreement on the final status of these areas will then be submitted to a
                        vote by the representatives of the inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza,
                        and they will have the right for the first time in their history, the
                        Palestinian people, to decide how they will govern themselves
                        permanently.</p>
                    <p>We also believe, of course, all of us, that there should be a just settlement
                        of the problems of displaced persons and refugees, which takes into account
                        appropriate United Nations resolutions.</p>
                    <pb n="468" facs="0509" xml:id="pg_468"/>
                    <p>Finally, this document also outlines a variety of security arrangements to
                        reinforce peace between Israel and her neighbors. This is, indeed, a
                        comprehensive and fair framework for peace in the Middle East, and I’m glad
                        to report this to you.</p>
                    <p>The second agreement is entitled, “A Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace
                        Treaty Between Egypt and Israel.” It returns to Egypt its full exercise of
                        sovereignty over the Sinai Peninsula and establishes several security zones,
                        recognizing carefully that sovereignty right for the protection of all
                        parties. It also provides that Egypt will extend full diplomatic recognition
                        to Israel at the time the Israelis complete an interim withdrawal from most
                        of the Sinai, which will take place between 3 months and 9 months after the
                        conclusion of the peace treaty. And the peace treaty is to be fully
                        negotiated and signed no later than 3 months from last night.</p>
                    <p>I think I should also report that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                            >Begin</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                            >Sadat</persName> have already challenged each other to conclude the
                        treaty even earlier. And I hope they—[<hi rend="italic">applause</hi>]. This
                        final conclusion of a peace treaty will be completed late in December, and
                        it would be a wonderful Christmas present for the world.</p>
                    <p>Final and complete withdrawal of all Israeli forces will take place between 2
                        and 3 years following the conclusion of the peace treaty.</p>
                    <p>While both parties are in total agreement on all the goals that I have just
                        described to you, there is one issue on which agreement has not yet been
                        reached. Egypt states that agreement to remove the Israeli settlements from
                        Egyptian territory is a prerequisite to a peace treaty. Israel says that the
                        issue of the Israeli settlements should be resolved during the peace
                        negotiations themselves.</p>
                    <p>Now, within 2 weeks, with each member of the Knesset or the Israeli
                        Parliament acting as individuals, not constrained by party loyalty, the
                        Knesset will decide on the issue of the settlements. Our own Government’s
                        position, my own personal position is well known on this issue and has been
                        consistent. It is my strong hope, my prayer, that the question of Israeli
                        settlements on Egyptian territory will not be the final obstacle to
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>None of us should underestimate the historic importance of what has already
                        been done. This is the first time that an Arab and an Israeli leader have
                        signed a comprehensive framework for peace. It contains the seeds of a time
                        when the Middle East, with all its vast potential, may be a land of human
                        richness and fulfillment, rather than a land of bitterness and continued
                        conflict. No region in the world has greater natural and human resources
                        than this one, and nowhere have they been more heavily weighed down by
                        intense hatred and frequent war. These agreements hold out the real
                        possibility that this burden might finally be lifted.</p>
                    <pb n="469" facs="0510" xml:id="pg_469"/>
                    <p>But we must also not forget the magnitude of the obstacles that still remain.
                        The summit exceeded our highest expectations, but we know that it left many
                        difficult issues which are still to be resolved. These issues will require
                        careful negotiation in the months to come. The Egyptian and Israeli people
                        must recognize the tangible benefits that peace will bring and support the
                        decisions their leaders have made, so that a secure and a peaceful future
                        can be achieved for them. The American public, you and I, must also offer
                        our full support to those who have made decisions that are difficult and
                        those who have very difficult decisions still to make.</p>
                    <p>What lies ahead for all of us is to recognize the statesmanship that
                        President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> and Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Begin</persName> have shown and to invite
                        others in that region to follow their example. I have already, last night,
                        invited the other leaders of the Arab world to help sustain progress toward
                        a comprehensive peace.</p>
                    <p>We must also join in an effort to bring an end to the conflict and the
                        terrible suffering in Lebanon. This is a subject that President <persName
                            corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> discussed with me many times while I
                        was in Camp David with him. And the first time that the three of us met
                        together, this was a subject of heated discussion. On the way to Washington
                        last night in the helicopter, we mutually committed ourselves to join with
                        other nations, with the Lebanese people themselves, all factions, with
                        President Sarkis, with Syria and Saudi Arabia, perhaps the European
                        countries like France, to try to move toward a solution of the problem in
                        Lebanon, which is so vital to us and to the poor people in Lebanon, who have
                        suffered so much.</p>
                    <p>We will want to consult on this matter and on these documents and their
                        meaning with all of the leaders, particularly the Arab leaders. And I’m
                        pleased to say to you tonight that just a few minutes ago, King <persName
                            corresp="#p_HT_3">Hussein</persName> of Jordan and King Khalid of Saudi
                        Arabia, perhaps other leaders later, but these two have already agreed to
                        receive Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>, who will be
                        leaving tomorrow to explain to them the terms of the Camp David
                            agreement.<note n="4" xml:id="d96fn4">The records of <persName

                        their support for the realization of the new hopes and dreams of the people
                        of the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>This is an important mission, and this responsibility, I can tell you, based
                        on my last 2 weeks with him, could not possibly rest on the shoulders of a
                        more able and dedicated and competent man than Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cyrus Vance</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Finally, let me say that for many years the Middle East has been a textbook
                        for pessimism, a demonstration that diplomatic ingenuity <pb n="470"
                            facs="0511" xml:id="pg_470"/>was no match for intractable human
                        conflicts. Today we are privileged to see the chance for one of the
                        sometimes rare, bright moments in human history—a chance that may offer the
                        way to peace. We have a chance for peace, because these two brave leaders
                        found within themselves the willingness to work together to seek these
                        lasting prospects for peace, which we all want so badly. And for that, I
                        hope that you will share my prayer of thanks and my hope that the promise of
                        this moment shall be fully realized.</p>
                    <p>The prayers at Camp David were the same as those of the shepherd King David,
                        who prayed in the 85th Psalm, “Wilt thou not revive us again; that thy
                        people may rejoice in thee? . . . I will hear what God the Lord will speak:
                        for he will speak peace unto his people, and unto his saints: but let them
                        not return again unto folly.”</p>
                    <p>And I would like to say, as a Christian, to these two friends of mine, the
                        words of Jesus, “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be the children
                        of God.”</p>

                    <p>The President first wanted to tell the Minister that he was glad to have him
                        come back to Washington for this meeting. He was happy to note that
                        relations between our two countries appeared to be rapidly improving. He
                        believed that a matter of first priority for our two states was successful
                        completion of the work on the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                            Agreement.<note n="2" xml:id="d97fn2">In his weekly report, September
                            29, <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> suggested that it
                            would be helpful for <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> to
                            stress to <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> several points
                            made previously: “that we desire to improve the relationship, that it is
                            our determination to seek <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, but
                            that the overall status of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>-Soviet
                            relationship is not immune to events in key parts of the world. In this
                            connection, we are concerned about Cuban/Soviet behavior in Africa and
                            Soviet attacks on the Camp David Accords.” The President underlined
                            “improve the relationship,” “seek <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss>,” “not immune,” “Africa,” and “Camp David Accords.”

                        be accomplished this morning. The President also wanted <persName

                        detente remained a major aim and keystone of our policy. We wanted our
                        relations with the Soviet Union to be based on mutual respect and mutual
                        advantage. There had been mention of competition as well as cooperation
                        between us. The President wanted to put major emphasis on cooperation.<note

                            following point: “In brief, I think it is important to use the meeting
                            with <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> also to communicate
                            a broader message: that as you said at Annapolis, détente should be <hi

                        quite frankly that over the recent period our relations had worsened. It was
                        true, of course, that he did discern a somewhat more positive note in recent
                        statements by the President’s representatives, in the President’s comments
                        today and in some press articles, indicating that in<note n="5"

                        there had been somewhat of a turning point for the better. That might be so,
                        but he had to say that he had not discerned anything truly substantive to
                        indicate an improvement in our relations. The fact that our relations had
                        become worse as compared to the past was known to the whole world, and this
                        could not fail to concern and perplex the Soviet Union. He wanted to convey
                        this to the President in all frankness. He had taken note of the President’s
                        pronouncement, contained in his message to Brezhnev, where the President had
                        used words to the effect that we should not try to place the blame for the
                        worsening of relations between us, but should look ahead.<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d97fn6">Presumable reference is to the President’s September 2
                            letter to Brezhnev. In it, the President commented: “I am distressed, as
                            I know you are, that relations between our two countries have not
                            developed well. We would each have our own explanation of why this has
                            been the case, but I do not believe it would be useful to repeat
                            familiar arguments about who or what is to blame.” The President’s
                            letter is printed in <ref target="frus1977-80v05#d142">

                        he would point out that the Soviet Union was not prepared to assume any
                        blame for the worsening of relations and he wanted the President to know
                        that.</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> noted that in those matters
                        where our respective views did not fully coincide, or did not coincide at
                        all, affairs could be conducted in a number of different ways. These
                        differences could be discussed without crossing a certain line, throwing
                        back the relations between us.<note n="7" xml:id="d97fn7">The sentence
                            originally began with “These.” <persName corresp="#p_KWD_1"
                                >Krimer</persName> deleted it and capitalized “differences.”</note>
                        These relations had been laboriously built up between the Soviet Union and
                        the United States and the process had not been easy. Quite the contrary, it
                        had been an arduous and difficult road. On the one hand, relations between
                        us could be conducted with the use of fine instruments, seeking ways to
                        bridge gaps and to come to mutual understanding. On the other hand, one
                        could also use an axe, raising and dropping it repeatedly to sever the
                        threads that existed between us. Again, speaking quite frankly, he would
                        point out that in his view the latter method was the one used by the United
                        States quite frequently in the recent past. Of course, such a situation
                        could not but have a negative impact on the delicate process called
                        international detente. He <pb n="473" facs="0514" xml:id="pg_473"/>would
                        hope that in all assessments of each other’s policy neither side would fail
                        to observe a certain sense of proportion and not go beyond a certain limit.
                        As seen by many people, one or two statements by the leaders of one of our
                        countries were quite enough to derail detente. Of course, it would not be
                        much of a detente if that were really true. He regarded it as a process that
                        goes much deeper, one that was based on the hearts and minds of literally
                        hundreds of millions of people.<note n="8" xml:id="d97fn8">
                            <persName corresp="#p_KWD_1">Krimer</persName> substituted “détente” for
                            “it.”</note> He did believe that if one plotted detente as a curve on a
                        graph, on the whole that curve was pointing upward. There were ups and
                        downs, to be sure, but on the whole if one felt the pulse of hundreds and
                        hundreds of millions of people all over the world, detente was on an upward
                        track. It was a process that needed to be developed and was developing, but
                        the greater the effort applied in that direction the better and stronger it
                        would be. For its part, the Soviet Union was fully prepared to do all in its
                        power to promote everything that furthered detente, and to preserve in our
                        mutual relations everything that had been achieved in the past, and boldly
                        go further.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to assure the
                        President that in all its actions the Soviet Union was not trying to
                        undercut relations between the United States and third countries so long as
                        these relations were not directed against the Soviet Union. He and the
                        Soviet leadership felt that conditions were now ripe for going ahead,
                        improving and strengthening our relations.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> noted that in his statement
                        today the President had not referred to one thought which he had repeatedly
                        expressed in the past. Perhaps that was only an oversight, but it was an
                        axiom of foreign policy that the nature of relations between the Soviet
                        Union and the United States to an enormous extent determined the general
                        world situation, the state of detente, the state of East-West relations and
                        the international atmosphere as a whole. That was indisputable, and it was
                        an idea the President had put forward in the past and, with which the Soviet
                        Union agreed wholeheartedly.<note n="9" xml:id="d97fn9">Krimer deleted the

                        <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> said that was one aspect of

                        situation throughout the world. That was not necessarily to everyone’s
                        liking and he was aware of the many epithets being directed at each of us,
                        but particularly at the Soviet Union, referring to superpowers, to attempts

                    <p>As the dust blown up by the crisis in Nicaragua settles for the moment, and
                        the mediators try to patch together an “enduring democratic solution,” I
                        think it is important to step back and ask ourselves: Can a Nicaraguan-type
                        crisis happen again?<note n="2" xml:id="d98fn2">Documentation on the

                        prevent similar crises?</p>
                    <p>The simple answer is that it can happen again, and is likely to in El
                        Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. The conditions which gave rise to the
                        crisis in Nicaragua exist in these countries, only in a more advanced
                        state.</p>

                    <p>The unique element in Nicaragua is, of course, <persName corresp="#p_SD_1"
                            >Somoza</persName>, but I believe that his presence meant only that
                        violence and polarization would occur in Nicaragua <hi rend="italic"
                            >first</hi>; not that it won’t occur elsewhere. In a few years, if we
                        don’t address the underlying problems in Central America, the Nicaraguan
                        crisis of 1978 will seem easy in comparison. <hi rend="italic">I would urge

                        <hi rend="roman">I.</hi> Characteristics Common to the Region</p>
                    <p>The three Central American countries share (with Nicaragua) the following
                        tragic characteristics:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Political Alignment: Three Groups.</hi> (1) A strong,
                        intransigent military government with little or no popular support; (2)
                        revolutionary guerrilla groups which are predominantly indigenous but
                        maintain ties with the Cubans and with each other; and (3) a relatively weak
                        but hopeful middle, which includes political parties (Christian and Social
                        Democrats), the Church, and small business. Since the middle of the
                        political spectrum in Central America is considerably to the right of that
                        in the U.S., the political middle is generally quite conservative by U.S.
                        standards.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Severe Structural Problems</hi>. Economic inequality;
                        rapid population growth; inadequate bureaucratic capabilities; and slow
                        economic growth.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Continued Massive U.S. Presence</hi>. The U.S. influence
                        and presence in this region remains very formidable. The perception of U.S.
                        influence often is greater than the reality but in Central America that is
                        both an asset and liability: it enables us to more easily achieve some of
                        our objectives, but it also stimulates a negative and reactive nationalism
                        among some and a “Fanonian” immaturity among others.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d98fn3">Reference is to Frantz Fanon, an influential

                    </p>
                    <p>The U.S. commitment to human rights and democratization is clearly and widely
                        understood. The military governments that once felt they could serve the
                        U.S. interest in stability in whatever way they wanted now feel inhibited
                        from using violence or torture to suppress political opposition or to
                        eliminate guerrilla movements. As <persName corresp="#p_THO_1"
                            >Torrijos</persName> likes to say, “After <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName>, military dictators have to count to 10 before
                        killing someone.” Both the democratic opposition and the guerrillas seem
                        intent on taking advantage of this new situation.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Political Polarization</hi>. Government-sanctioned
                        counter-terrorism was the rule before the <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> Administration. Now, the military governments—like
                            <persName corresp="#p_SD_1">Somoza</persName>’s—have begun harassing the
                        middle. The left has done this as well. Polarization has increased as the
                        middle has been <pb n="476" facs="0517" xml:id="pg_476"/>forced to choose
                        sides. If the opposition prevails in Nicaragua, the democratic middle in
                        these other countries may conclude that it is time to throw their fate in
                        with the guerrillas against the government.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Transnational Linkages</hi>. The extremes have obtained
                        help, training, and encouragement from abroad. The military has obtained
                        arms from the Israelis, Argentines, and the international black market. The
                        left is getting increasing help from each other. A recent intelligence
                        report suggests that the Cubans have also decided to encourage local—in this
                        case, Honduran cadres—to assist in training and equipping their comrades,
                        the <gloss target="#t_TP_1">TP</gloss> faction of the Sandinistas.</p>
                    <p>These conditions combine to present U.S. policy with two major problems,
                        perhaps dilemmas:</p>
                    <p>1. How do we deal with the fact that the political middle is under attack
                        from the two extremes? What can we do to effectively promote our human
                        rights policy?</p>
                    <p>2. How do we reconcile our goal of wanting to discard a century of U.S.
                        paternalism with a need and an instinct to try to manage events rather than
                        let them manage us?</p>
                    <p>Regardless of the outcome in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala
                        will continue to be plagued by polarization. The left will harass, and the
                        right will repress, creating more support for the left. The political
                        dynamic is almost inevitable. Moreover, whatever happens in Nicaragua will
                        spill over to its neighbors, and indeed it already has.</p>

                        Framework</p>
                    <p>If I may borrow one of your analytic modes, I think the problem of Central
                        America can be best understood by viewing it in three concentric
                        circles:</p>
                    <p>1. The internal political upheavals in El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala.</p>
                    <p>2. The relationship of those countries with each other and with Costa Rica
                        and Panama. (Dealing not only with the problem of international terrorism,
                        but also with the El Salvador-Honduras border dispute, Belize, and the
                        Central American Common Market.)</p>
                    <p>3. The larger relationship of Central America to the U.S., Mexico, Venezuela,
                        Colombia, and the Caribbean.</p>
                    <p>A. Our <hi rend="italic">goals</hi> are the following:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Internal Politics in Central America.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>(a) Strengthen the democratic center in each country and the links between
                        these groups in different countries.</p>
                    <p>(b) Provide an atmosphere conducive to the eventual evolution of
                        democratically-elected governments.</p>
                    <pb n="477" facs="0518" xml:id="pg_477"/>
                    <p>(c) Encourage a more equitable distribution of wealth and the necessary
                        socio-economic reforms which will permit this.</p>
                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Central America</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Our goals are to strengthen the peace by assisting in the settlement of
                        long-standing territorial disputes and to promote economic cooperation and
                        integration.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Caribbean Basin</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Our goals have been spelled out in the President’s Caribbean policy.</p>
                    <p>The first circle—internal politics in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala—is
                        the most urgent, but we will not have a coherent and positive policy until
                        we have begun to address all three sets of problems associated with each
                        concentric circle.</p>
                    <p>B. Our <hi rend="italic">means</hi> for pursuing these goals are
                        considerable. We have relatively large bilateral assistance programs to
                        these small and poor countries, and a large proportion of the loans they
                        receive from the Inter-American Development Bank are concessional (from
                            <gloss target="#t_FSO_1">FSO</gloss>) over which we have a veto. This
                        leverage has in the past translated into real influence. For example, our
                        decision to withhold support for a loan to build a hydroelectric project in
                        El Salvador last year led the government to lift the state of siege.
                        Unfortunately, we continue to deal with aid and loans one at a time without
                        any overall strategic approach.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the most important source of U.S. influence is simply U.S. symbolic
                        support, including Presidential attention. An expression of interest by the
                        President in the 10-year-old El Salvador-Honduras border dispute encouraged
                        the Hondurans to ratify a mediation agreement in September 1977 (during the
                        Canal Treaty signing in Washington).<note n="4" xml:id="d98fn4">In his diary
                            entry for September 8, 1977, the President noted that he had met with
                            President Romero that day: “My major purpose was to get El Salvador to
                            agree to a mediation formula for the border dispute with Honduras. He
                            agreed to move on this, which has kept the Pan-American Highway closed
                            for a long time and resulted in severing of relationships altogether
                            between Honduras and El Salvador. Before they left Washington, this was
                            done.” (<hi rend="italic">White House Diary,</hi> p. 94)</note> I would
                        guess that a small touch by the President at a well-timed moment could have
                        a large impact on this area. (We may want to factor into a future review the
                        possibility of a short visit by the President—perhaps as a follow-on to a
                        Mexico trip<note n="5" xml:id="d98fn5">

                        area, and to stimulate negotiations on El Salvador-Honduras, Belize, or on
                        economic integration to try to reach a conclusion before that. Such a visit
                        would also help to restore some sense of stability to a region still rocking
                        with Nicaragua.)</p>

                        American policy. The scenario is the same as what may face us in Nicaragua:
                        a choice between supporting an unpopular military dictator or intervening to
                        prevent a Communist take-over. Neither alternative is satisfactory, but in
                        order to face a different choice, we have to begin developing a strategy now
                        to mobilize U.S. influence in support of the goals listed above.<note n="6"

                        reacting to events at points of relatively little influence; we need to get
                        in front of the political process in Central America rather than get pulled

                    <p rend="center">The U.S. and the Third World: Partners or Plaintiffs</p>
                    <p>Eight years ago I spoke to the Commonwealth Club on the subject “The United
                        States and the Third World.” That was in 1970, the year of the 25th
                        anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. My remarks at that time
                        dwelt on the growing influence of the newly independent nations in the
                        United Nations and in world affairs generally. I dwelt also on growing
                        differences which were appearing between the views of these countries and
                        those of the United States. This was true with respect to the process of
                        decolonization, trade, and racial discrimination.</p>
                    <p>In 1970 most Americans were only vaguely aware of the potential power and
                        influence of the developing countries. The general opinion was that the
                        newly independent countries of this century would not, for many years to
                        come, be major factors in either economic or political affairs.</p>
                    <p>A series of events over the last 6 years has shaken that view. In 1973 the
                        Arab oil-producing states successfully mounted an embargo against the United
                        States. Once the oil-producing states understood their power as a result of
                        the embargo, they moved successfully to raise the price of oil dramatically.
                        Other developing countries, instead of expressing dismay at the impact of
                        the price rises on their own economies, saw benefits for the developing
                        world in general in relating similar tactics to other commodities. In 1974
                        in Algiers the new international economic order was born with its strong
                        demands for greater equality in economic relations between the developed and
                        the developing countries.<note n="2" xml:id="d99fn2">The fourth conference

                        That session brought home starkly to American policymakers for the first
                        time the potential impact of these demands on our political as well as our

                        confrontations the previous year still fresh in their minds, both sides
                        began to rethink their respective positions and to search for areas of

                        ongoing dialogue and resulted in concrete progress on some issues such as
                        food and agriculture and technical assistance. And while <gloss

                    <p>As a result, <gloss target="#t_CIEC_1">CIEC</gloss> was succeeded by the

                        relating to the North-South dialogue. The developing countries would like to
                        give it a decisionmaking role. We continue to believe decisions on major
                        economic issues should be made by existing organizations having
                        responsibilities in the specific functional areas, for example, the <gloss

                    <p>There were other elements to the dialogue. The year 1976 saw the Nairobi

                        willingness to maintain a constructive dialogue regarding the demands of the
                        developing countries. This willingness to engage in dialogue was, however,
                        clearly separated from any affirmation of the legitimacy of all the other
                        demands of these countries. Subsequently, at Colombo, Sri Lanka, the
                        nonaligned nations met and found that economic issues had replaced political
                        issues as the prime vehicles for expressing their aspirations and
                            frustrations.<note n="7" xml:id="d99fn7">The fifth annual conference of

                    </p>
                    <p>I have been speaking to you about the Third World. I know that there are
                        those who question the validity of this term. They rightly point out that
                        there is a tremendous difference between the least developed and the middle
                        countries. This is true. Nevertheless, the strong feelings which exist among
                        these countries arising from a common heritage of colonialism, from their
                        perception of themselves as economically developing nations and from a
                        feeling that they lack a voice in major economic decisions affecting them,
                        give these countries a solidarity which is a reality. That solidarity
                        withstood differences over the oil crisis. It has withstood general
                        differences of view, for example, between those countries that are
                        interested in debt relief and those countries which are more concerned about
                        their international credit standing.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Importance of the North-South Relationship</p>
                    <p>It has been my experience that audiences attuned to the more exciting
                        political aspects of foreign affairs do not find equal stimulation in
                        discussions of economic issues. Yet, the average American citizen—concerned
                        for his job, his standard of living, and the value of the dollar at home and
                        abroad—has good reason to pay attention to the demands, sometimes excessive,
                        of the Third World nations. Only a few statistics will illustrate why.</p>
                    <p>• In 1977, 35% of total U.S. exports—$42 billion—went to developing
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>• The United States sells more manufactured goods to the developing countries
                        than to Western Europe, Japan, and all the Communist countries combined.</p>
                    <p>• The developing countries accounted for more than half of all U.S. exports
                        of industrial machinery, electrical machinery, and aircraft.</p>
                    <p>• They bought 50% of our wheat exports, 60% of our cotton exports, 70% of our
                        rice exports, and 90% of our coal exports.</p>
                    <p>• The United States imported goods worth $67 billion from developing
                        countries in 1977—45% of our total imports.</p>
                    <pb n="482" facs="0523" xml:id="pg_482"/>
                    <p>These are impressive statistics, but they are hard to relate to our everyday
                        lives. It perhaps comes closer to home if we address the importance of the
                        North-South relationship in terms of questions like:</p>

                    <p>• How much will it cost to fill it up?</p>
                    <p>• How much more would you need to pay for a chocolate bar, for coffee, for
                        copper wire, if the developing countries should seek to emulate the
                        Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and restrict supplies or raise
                        prices?</p>
                    <p>• How many workers would be laid off in your community if developing
                        countries shifted their purchases from the United States to other
                        suppliers?</p>
                    <p>Each issue has implications for our daily lives as well as for our
                        relationship with two-thirds of the peoples of the world. The developing
                        nations have addressed themselves to several key issues. Each one presents
                        us with problems, particularly in a time of economic difficulties. Approval
                        of new departures for any one of them could face strong opposition in the
                        Congress. Yet each one is a key to whether we shall be partners or
                        adversaries in our relations with the developing world. Let me take briefly
                        each one in turn.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic Issues</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Trade.</hi> The first is trade. The developing countries
                        want improved access to our markets for their exports. They want special and
                        preferential treatment for their manufactured products.</p>
                    <p>We believe improved market access is desirable and in our own interest. In
                        the event of injury to domestic industry, of course, we must take temporary
                        measures to protect jobs and producers, preferably through adjustment
                        assistance or, if necessary, through restrictions at the borders.</p>
                    <p>There has been hard bargaining with many developing countries in the
                        multilateral trade negotiations which have just wound up work in Geneva.
                        These extended and complex negotiations have offered the developing
                        countries an opportunity to gain benefits. Unfortunately, we feel they have
                        not fully availed themselves of these opportunities.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Aid.</hi> The developing countries also seek an
                        increase in the transfer of resources which they need for economic
                        development. They wish a level of economic assistance from developed
                        countries which would represent seven-tenths of 1% of such countries’ gross
                        national product. The implications of this demand are illustrated by two
                        simple facts.</p>
                    <p>• The enthusiasm for foreign aid in the United States is declining. In 1970
                        we ranked seventh among the developed countries in the per<pb n="483"
                            facs="0524" xml:id="pg_483"/>centage of our gross national product
                        transferred concessionally to developing countries. Today we have dropped to
                        twelfth.</p>
                    <p>• We have changed our approach to foreign aid in part as a result of
                        congressional legislation. In the face of a continued need by many countries
                        for infrastructure assistance, particularly in Africa, we are concentrating
                        more and more on the needs of the poor. We look to the multilateral
                        institutions to provide infrastructure assistance. We are unable to supply
                        straight budgetary assistance to meet the special problem of middle-income
                        countries. This problem is particularly acute in the Caribbean.</p>
                    <p>Some of the most active negotiations have related to commodities. The
                        developing countries have given a high priority to stabilizing broad
                        fluctuations in commodity prices which have such a profound effect on
                        countries depending almost entirely on one or two primary products.</p>
                    <p>We have now indicated our acceptance in principle of the idea of a common
                        fund which would be used to help commodity agreements to stabilize commodity
                            prices.<note n="8" xml:id="d99fn8">The Common Fund negotiations began in
                            Geneva in November 1977; see <ref target="#d58fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                58</ref>. Talks on the Common Fund were scheduled to resume in
                            Geneva on November 14, 1978. On November 16, <hi rend="italic">The
                                Washington Post</hi> reported that the <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                                >Carter</persName> administration agreed to make a direct
                            contribution to the Fund. (Hobart Rowen, “U.S., in Key Shift, Accepts
                            Demand of Third World,” p. A–21) See also <ref

                        differences over the form of such a fund and whether it would also be used
                        to provide resources not directly related to stabilization of commodity
                        prices. Those who follow both our relations with the developing countries
                        and our relations with Congress will hear more of the common fund in the
                        days ahead.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Debt Relief.</hi> Debt is a highly important and highly
                        emotional issue, as it is with individuals. We have always taken the
                        position that debt relief should be conditioned upon a debtor country
                        promising to undertake a comprehensive sound economic development or
                        stabilization program, one that would insure that excesses in resource
                        mismanagement are not repeated. Many feel strongly that the developed
                        countries have an obligation to relieve them of their debt burden. We are
                        now committed to debt forgiveness for the poorest countries and are studying
                        how much relief we should provide in 1980.</p>
                    <p>The two principal multilateral financial institutions—the World Bank and the
                        International Monetary Fund—were founded well before the creation of most of
                        the nations in the United Nations today. Newly independent countries and
                        many other Third World countries as well wish to move away from voting in
                        international institutions based on financial contributions toward a one
                        state, one vote system giving a <pb n="484" facs="0525" xml:id="pg_484"
                        />preponderant voice to the developing countries. Such a move in the minds
                        of many in the United States would represent a departure from the
                        objectivity and nonpolitical character of these institutions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Technology Transfers.</hi> Developing countries today must
                        often pay very large amounts in order to obtain the rights to technology
                        which they feel important for their industrial development. They are seeking
                        to liberalize the transfer of technology believing that this would speed up
                        the closing of the gap between rich nations and poor nations. They also seek
                        support for expanding their indigenous capacity to develop and adopt such
                        technology.</p>
                    <p>There is, of course, a vast quantity of technology which is noncommercially
                        held, and we have ongoing programs which seek to make that available to the
                        developing countries. On the other hand, technology of commercial value held
                        by firms in the investing nations has a value which these firms,
                        understandably, do not wish to relinquish without a return on their
                        investment. Various ways by which this privately owned technology can be
                        more easily transferred are under consideration. The matter remains a
                        significant and controversial issue.</p>
                    <p>Foreign direct investments are an important source of economic resources and
                        technology for the developing countries. Differing views exist, however, on
                        whether such investments are beneficial to the developing nations. For more
                        than a year the U.N. Commission on Transnational Corporations has sought to
                        elaborate a code of conduct within which such corporations could operate to
                        the satisfaction of both sides. In the view of the developed world, private
                        foreign investment represents one of the best and least political means by
                        which transfers of both capital and technology can be effected. And while
                        the corporate investors are willing to accommodate to demands for sharing of
                        ownership and management which will provide greater benefits and
                        opportunities for the people of the countries involved, they must ask and
                        receive some kind of assurance that, once having invested their capital, the
                        rules of the game will not be changed in ways which result in the loss of
                        their investment.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Political Issues</p>
                    <p>I have dwelt today upon the economic issues which are under constant
                        discussion between the developed nations of the North and the developing
                        countries of the South. When nations gather, increasingly these are the
                        concerns that trouble them most. And these concerns have a direct impact on
                        political relations which in turn can affect the climate in which the
                        economic issues are resolved. One soon finds that there is no distinction
                        between political and economic affairs when the livelihood and security of
                        nations is involved.</p>
                    <p>The strong efforts of the United States to resolve the problems in the Middle
                        East have a direct bearing upon our access to the vital re<pb n="485"
                            facs="0526" xml:id="pg_485"/>sources of this region and to the economic
                        health of the nations processing these resources.</p>
                    <p>The political issues of South Africa, Namibia, and Southern Rhodesia can
                        cloud our dialogue with African states on other issues, even when our
                        position on such matters as trade, development assistance, commodity policy,
                        and debt rescheduling is clear and positive.</p>
                    <p>The danger of political instability in key areas threatening our national
                        security is ever present. One needs only to look at events in Iran and
                        consider the effects of a change in the orientation of that country on our
                        strategic and economic interests in the area, or to look at Nic-aragua and
                        think about the implications of spreading unrest in Central America, our
                        doorstep, to understand the political-economic interrelationship.</p>
                    <p>Finally, there are a whole series of foreign policy issues of prime
                        importance to us—nuclear nonproliferation, human rights, arms control—which
                        cannot be moved forward in a meaningful fashion without the cooperation of
                        the Third World countries.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, in our national interest, we wish to do what we can to see that
                        Third World societies evolve in ways which are compatible with the kind of
                        world we wish to live in and leave to our children. If we ignore these
                        countries, their needs, and their aspirations, we will forfeit our ability
                        to exert this influence which can be so important to our own future.</p>
                    <p>So, the issues that we face in dealing with the Third World have implications
                        not just for our daily lives, but also for our national security now and our
                        future in the society of men. Thus, the fostering and strengthening of the
                        dialogue between the North and the South is extremely important to all of
                        us.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Fostering a Positive Dialogue</p>
                    <p>The coming year will see a large number of international conferences devoted
                        to fundamental questions of relations between developed and developing
                        countries. Negotiations have recently begun under <gloss
                            target="#t_UNCTAD_1">UNCTAD</gloss> auspices on a new international
                        wheat agreement; in April the law of the sea conference will resume
                        consideration of who controls the vast mineral resources of the deep
                        seabeds; in June <gloss target="#t_UNCTAD_1">UNCTAD</gloss> 5 convenes in
                        Manila; in August the U.N. Conference on Science and Technology for
                        Development begins in Vienna; and in 1980 we expect a U.N. General Assembly
                        special session on development. Moreover, progress is being made in
                        developing a positive dialogue with the Third World.</p>
                    <p>One can point to the Association of the South East Asian Nations. These five
                        nations—Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand—are
                        important friends and trading partners particularly <pb n="486" facs="0527"
                            xml:id="pg_486"/>of the states on the west coast. They are keenly
                        interested in all of the North-South issues. They have taken a leading and
                        constructive role in the international discussions of these issues. They
                        have had direct dialogues with the United States, the European Economic
                        Community, Japan, Canada, and Australia. In addition, they are reconciling
                        difficult trade matters among themselves. They are demonstrating by their
                        own growth the very great potential which exists in the developing
                        countries. They have received and deserved strong support from us. Their
                        progress demonstrates that despite the complexity of these issues, dialogue
                        can bring positive results for both.</p>
                    <p>In 1978 relations between the United States and the Third World remain a
                        significant part of our foreign policy agenda. As much as any other issue
                        these matters bear directly on your daily life and mine. It is the hope of
                        those of us who deal with them that, despite the complex nature of these
                        issues, they will receive the serious attention of those concerned with
                        foreign affairs. We hope in turn that organizations such as those
                        represented here today will lend their support for a positive and
                        constructive role for the United States in this ongoing discussion with
                        nations which represent three-fifths of the world’s population.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">On Negotiating</p>
                    <p>The comments which follow are not meant to be just negative—but I feel that I
                        should share my concern that the way we have been conducting our
                        negotiations on some key issues may be reducing our credibility and
                        therefore also our ability to attain our goals.</p>

                    <p>In negotiations there often comes the time to force the issue to a head by
                        making the other side take stock of the consequences of failure. One should
                        even be willing to deliberately create such circumstances, as <persName
                            corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> has done from time to time. Of
                        course, before one does so one should carefully marshal one’s resources and
                        calculate timing very carefully.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>We have been dribbling our concessions, and asserting from time to time that
                        we would go no further. Yet time after time we would then make additional
                            concessions.<note n="2" xml:id="d100fn2">In the left-hand margin next to
                            this paragraph, the President wrote: “<gloss target="#t_SU_1">SU</gloss>
                            does the same.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The latest example pertains to the ALCMs: as a major concession we told the
                        Soviets that we would accept the limit of 35 as an average. The Soviets
                        countered with 25. We immediately offered 30 as a compromise. The Soviets
                        are now talking of a figure of between 25 and 30 as the outcome, despite our
                        accommodation on the definition issue.<note n="3" xml:id="d100fn3">In the
                            left-hand margin next to this paragraph, the President wrote: “Only
                            symbolically important.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Indeed, Cy put the new definition to <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1"
                            >Dobrynin</persName> earlier this week on the assumption that this would
                        solve all the remaining issues—an assumption <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1"
                            >Dobrynin</persName> led us to suspect is true. The opposite has
                        happened, and the Soviets are even reopening some old issues.</p>
                    <p>I am convinced the Soviets want a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        agreement, and I think there is a good probability that we could have
                        obtained one some months ago had we been prepared to establish credibly the
                        position that we are no longer able to make further adjustments and that we
                        can wait.<note n="4" xml:id="d100fn4">In the right-hand margin next to this

                    <p>We told the Cubans we would not go to Havana without an expectation of
                        concrete positive developments—by which we clearly meant their troops in
                        Africa. We then proposed to go to Havana if they would simply let out the
                        four American political prisoners. When they refused to do even that, we end
                        up sending a delegation anyway, albeit at a somewhat lower level. This does
                        not help our credibility.<note n="5" xml:id="d100fn5">At the end of this

                    <p>I suspect that the root cause of our current difficulty is that <persName

                        anything; and that <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> and the
                        Saudis no longer have confidence that we can deliver either on the wider
                        peace nor on regional protection from the Soviets. Not having pressed at
                        Camp David for some direct linkage between the accords, we have failed to
                        respond in any concrete way to <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                        >Begin</persName>’s subsequent negative actions regarding the West
                            Bank.<note n="6" xml:id="d100fn6">The President bracketed this paragraph
                            and added the following in the left-hand margin next to this paragraph:
                            “What have you suggested?”</note>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">South Africa</p>
                    <p>The basic reason why our difficulties are mounting is that our
                        middle-of-the-road solutions are collapsing as the situation becomes
                        polarized. The fact of the matter is that neither the whites nor the blacks
                        take us very seriously. There is no bite to our proposals, because we are
                        visibly reluctant to press the Soviet-Cuban issue (and thus leave the
                        radical blacks with an increasingly attractive militant option), or to apply
                        sanctions to the whites (thus encouraging them to engage in dilatory
                            tactics).<note n="7" xml:id="d100fn7">The President underlined the
                            phrase “the radical blacks” and added the following in the left-hand

                    </p>
                    <p>In brief, we should be prepared to demonstrate to all concerned that the U.S.
                        has clout as well as patience, and that there are evident and predictable
                        costs for disregarding U.S. interests. Instead, we have given rise to the
                        view that the best way of dealing with us is to simply keep nibbling away,
                        and that eventually the U.S. will simply adjust its position. <hi

                    <p>There is no question in my mind that we are confronting the beginning of a
                        major crisis, in some ways similar to the one in Europe in the late 40’s.
                        Fragile social and political structures in a region of vital importance to
                        us are threatened with fragmentation.</p>
                    <p>The resulting political vacuum might well be filled by elements more
                        sympathetic to the Soviet Union. This is especially likely since there is a
                        pervasive feeling in the area that the U.S. is no longer in a position to
                        offer effective political and military protection.</p>
                    <p>If the above analysis is correct, the West as a whole may be faced with a
                        challenge of historic proportions. A shift in Iranian/Saudi orientation
                        would have a direct impact on trilateral cohesion, and it would induce in
                        time more “neutralist” attitudes on the part of some of our key allies. In a
                        sentence, it would mean a fundamental shift in the global structure of
                        power.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName> confronted a similar
                        crisis in the late 40’s in Western Europe. At that time, internal weaknesses
                        also interacted with an external challenge. It took a very major and
                        collective effort to respond effectively. That response involved a long-term
                        solution for political initiatives as well as more direct security
                        commitments.</p>
                    <p>I have asked an interagency group to review this problem on an urgent basis.
                        Though <persName corresp="#p_BGW_1">Ball</persName> will work primarily on
                        Iran, I might have him give some thought to this subject as well.</p>
                    <p>Before too long, we may have to consult also with our primary allies
                        regarding the need for a collective response, lest the kind of instability
                        that we are seeing in Pakistan and Iran becomes also manifest in the Persian
                        Gulf. This subject will doubtless come up in the January meeting, and before
                        then we will have some recommendations for you regarding what needs to be
                        done by the U.S. alone, by the U.S. and its principal allies, and by the
                        countries directly concerned.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, it might be appropriate for you to mention this emerging
                        problem in some of your discussions with Congressional leaders and also to

                        throughout the world to enhance human rights. No force on Earth can separate
                        us from that commitment.</p>
                    <p>This week we commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
                        Human Rights. We rededicate ourselves—in the words of Eleanor Roosevelt, who
                        was the chairperson of the Human Rights Commission—to the Universal
                        Declaration as, and I quote from her, “a common standard of achievement for
                        all peoples of all nations.”</p>
                    <p>The Universal Declaration and the human rights conventions that derive from
                        it do not describe the world as it is. But these documents are very
                        important, nonetheless. They are a beacon, a guide to a future of personal
                        security, political freedom, and social justice.</p>
                    <p>For millions of people around the globe that beacon is still quite distant, a
                        glimmer of light on a dark horizon of deprivation and repression. The
                        reports of Amnesty International, the International Commis<pb n="491"
                            facs="0532" xml:id="pg_491"/>sion of Jurists, the International League
                        for Human Rights, and many other nongovernmental human rights organizations
                        amply document the practices and conditions that destroy the lives and the
                        spirit of countless human beings.</p>
                    <p>Political killings, tortures, arbitrary and prolonged detention without trial
                        or without a charge, these are the cruelest and the ugliest of human rights
                        violations. Of all human rights, the most basic is to be free of arbitrary
                        violence, whether that violence comes from government, from terrorists, from
                        criminals, or from self-appointed messiahs operating under the cover of
                        politics or religion.</p>
                    <p>But governments—because of their power, which is so much greater than that of
                        an individual—have a special responsibility. The first duty of a government
                        is to protect its own citizens, and when government itself becomes the
                        perpetrator of arbitrary violence against its citizens, it undermines its
                        own legitimacy.</p>
                    <p>There are other violations of the body and the spirit which are especially
                        destructive of human life. Hunger, disease, poverty are enemies of human
                        potential which are as relentless as any repressive government.</p>
                    <p>The American people want the actions of their government, our government,
                        both to reduce human suffering and to increase human freedom. That’s
                        why—with the help and encouragement of many of you in this room—I have
                        sought to rekindle the beacon of human rights in American foreign policy.
                        Over the last 2 years we’ve tried to express these human concerns as our
                        diplomats practice their craft and as our Nation fulfills its own
                        international obligations.</p>
                    <p>We will speak out when individual rights are violated in other lands. The
                        Universal Declaration means that no nation can draw the cloak of sovereignty
                        over torture, disappearances, officially sanctioned bigotry, or the
                        destruction of freedom within its own borders. The message that is being
                        delivered by all our representatives abroad—whether they are from the
                        Department of State or Commerce or Agriculture or Defense or whatever—is
                        that the policies regarding human rights count very much in the character of
                        our own relations with other individual countries.</p>
                    <p>In distributing the scarce resources of our foreign assistance programs, we
                        will demonstrate that our deepest affinities are with nations which commit
                        themselves to a democratic path to development. Toward regimes which persist
                        in wholesale violations of human rights, we will not hesitate to convey our
                        outrage, nor will we pretend that our relations are unaffected.</p>
                    <p>In the coming year, I hope that Congress will take a step that has been long
                        overdue for a generation, the ratification of the Convention <pb n="492"
                            facs="0533" xml:id="pg_492"/>on the Prevention and Punishment of the
                        Crime of Genocide.<note n="3" xml:id="d101fn3">See <ref target="#d9fn7"
                                >footnote 7, Document 9</ref>.</note> As you know, the genocide
                        convention was also adopted by the United Nations General Assembly 30 years
                        ago this week, 1 day before the adoption of the Universal Declaration. It
                        was the world’s affirmation that the lesson of the Holocaust would never be
                        forgotten, but unhappily, genocide is not peculiar to any one historical
                        era.</p>
                    <p>Eighty-three other nations have ratified the genocide convention. The United
                        States, despite the support of every President since 1948, has not. In
                        international meetings at the United Nations and elsewhere, when I meet with
                        foreign leaders, we are often asked why. We do not have an acceptable
                        answer.</p>
                    <p>I urge the United States Senate to observe this anniversary in the only
                        appropriate way, by ratifying the genocide convention at the earliest
                        possible date.</p>
                    <p>This action must be the first step toward the ratification of other human
                        rights instruments, including those I signed a year ago.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d101fn4">See <ref target="#d9fn9">footnote 9, Document
                            9</ref>.</note> Many of the religious and human rights groups
                        represented here have undertaken a campaign of public education on behalf of
                        these covenants. I commend and appreciate your efforts.</p>
                    <p>Refugees are the living, homeless casualties of one very important failure on
                        the part of the world to live by the principles of peace and human rights.
                        To help these refugees is a simple human duty. As Americans, as a people
                        made up largely of the descendants of refugees, we feel that duty with
                        special keenness.</p>
                    <p>Our country will do its utmost to ease the plight of stranded refugees from
                        Indochina and from Lebanon and of released political prisoners from Cuba and
                        from elsewhere. I hope that we will always stand ready to welcome more than
                        our fair share of those who flee their homelands because of racial,
                        religious, or political oppression.</p>
                    <p>The effectiveness of our human rights policy is now an established fact. It
                        has contributed to an atmosphere of change—sometimes disturbing—but which
                        has encouraged progress in many ways and in many places. In some countries,
                        political prisoners have been released by the hundreds, even thousands. In
                        others, the brutality of repression has been lessened. In still others
                        there’s a movement toward democratic institutions or the rule of law when
                        these movements were not previously detectable.</p>
                    <p>To those who doubt the wisdom of our dedication, I say this: Ask the victims.
                        Ask the exiles. Ask the governments which continue to practice repression.
                        Whether in Cambodia or Chile, in Uganda or South <pb n="493" facs="0534"
                            xml:id="pg_493"/>Africa, in Nicaragua or Ethiopia or the Soviet Union,
                        governments know that we in the United States care. And not a single one of
                        those who is actually taking risks or suffering for human rights has ever
                        asked me to desist in our support of basic human rights. From the prisons,
                        from the camps, from the enforced exiles, we receive one message: Speak up,
                        persevere, let the voice of freedom be heard.</p>
                    <p>I’m very proud that our Nation stands for more than military might or
                        political might. It stands for ideals that have their reflection in the
                        aspirations of peasants in Latin America, workers in Eastern Europe,
                        students in Africa, and farmers in Asia.</p>
                    <p>We do live in a difficult and complicated world, a world in which peace is
                        literally a matter of survival. Our foreign policy must take this into
                        account. Often, a choice that moves us toward one goal tends to move us
                        further away from another goal. Seldom do circumstances permit me or you to
                        take actions that are wholly satisfactory to everyone.</p>
                    <p>But I want to stress again that human rights are not peripheral to the
                        foreign policy of the United States. Our human rights policy is not a
                        decoration. It is not something we’ve adopted to polish up our image abroad
                        or to put a fresh coat of moral paint on the discredited policies of the
                        past. Our pursuit of human rights is part of a broad effort to use our great
                        power and our tremendous influence in the service of creating a better
                        world, a world in which human beings can live in peace, in freedom, and with
                        their basic needs adequately met.</p>
                    <p>Human rights is the soul of our foreign policy. And I say this with
                        assurance, because human rights is the soul of our sense of nationhood.</p>
                    <p>For the most part, other nations are held together by common racial or ethnic
                        ancestry, or by a common creed or religion, or by ancient attachments to the
                        land that go back for centuries of time. Some nations are held together by
                        the forces, implied forces of a tyrannical government. We are different from
                        all of those, and I believe that we in our country are more fortunate.</p>
                    <p>As a people we come from every country and every corner of the Earth. We are
                        of many religions and many creeds. We are of every race, every color, every
                        ethnic and cultural background. We are right to be proud of these things and
                        of the richness that lend to the texture of our national life. But they are
                        not the things which unite us as a single people.</p>
                    <p>What unites us—what makes us Americans—is a common belief in peace, in a free
                        society, and a common devotion to the liberties enshrined in our
                        Constitution. That belief and that devotion are the sources of our sense of
                        national community. Uniquely, ours is a nation founded on an idea of human
                        rights. From our own history we know how powerful that idea can be.</p>
                    <pb n="494" facs="0535" xml:id="pg_494"/>
                    <p>Next week marks another human rights anniversary—Bill of Rights Day. Our
                        Nation was “conceived in liberty,” in Lincoln’s words, but it has taken
                        nearly two centuries for that liberty to approach maturity.</p>
                    <p>For most of the first half of our history, black Americans were denied even
                        the most basic human rights. For most of the first two-thirds of our
                        history, women were excluded from the political process. Their rights and
                        those of Native Americans are still not constitutionally guaranteed and
                        enforced. Even freedom of speech has been threatened periodically throughout
                        our history. Only in the last 10 to 12 years have we achieved what Father
                            <persName corresp="#p_HT_1">Hesburgh</persName> has called “the legal
                        abandonment of more than three centuries of apartheid.” And the struggle for
                        full human rights for all Americans—black, brown, and white; male and
                        female; rich and poor—is far from over.</p>
                    <p>To me, as to many of you, these are not abstract matters or ideas. In the
                        rural Georgia country where I grew up, the majority of my own fellow
                        citizens were denied many basic rights—the right to vote, the right to speak
                        freely without fear, the right to equal treatment under the law. I saw at
                        first hand the effects of a system of deprivation of rights. I saw the
                        courage of those who resisted that system. And finally, I saw the cleansing
                        energies that were released when my own region of this country walked out of
                        darkness and into what <persName corresp="#p_HHH_1">Hubert

                    <p>The American Bill of Rights is 187 years old, and the struggle to make it a
                        reality has occupied every one of those 187 years. The Universal Declaration
                        of Human Rights is only 30 years old. In the perspective of history, the
                        idea of human rights has only just been broached.</p>
                    <p>I do not draw this comparison because I want to counsel patience. I draw it
                        because I want to emphasize, in spite of difficulties, steadfastness and
                        commitment.</p>
                    <p>A hundred and eighty-seven years ago, as far as most Americans were
                        concerned, the Bill of Rights was a bill of promises. There was no guarantee
                        that those promises would ever be fulfilled. We did not realize those
                        promises by waiting for history to take its inevitable course. We realized
                        them because we struggled. We realized them because many sacrificed. We
                        realized them because we persevered.</p>

                    <p>For millions of people around the world today the Universal Declaration of
                        Human Rights is still only a declaration of hope. Like all of you, I want
                        that hope to be fulfilled. The struggle to fulfill it will last longer than
                        the lifetimes of any of us. Indeed, it will last as long as the lifetime of
                        humanity itself. But we must persevere.</p>
                    <p>And we must persevere by ensuring that this country of ours, leader in the
                        world, which we love so much, is always in the forefront of those who are
                        struggling for that great hope, the great dream of universal human

                    <p>a. In the <hi rend="italic">Middle East</hi>, there is a greater chance of
                        setting in motion a process that could lead to peace than at any time since
                        the creation of Israel. (C)</p>

                    <p>b. In <hi rend="italic">Central Europe</hi>, a <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> buildup has been launched, which seems likely to restore
                        the military stability that had been called into question by Soviet military
                        programs in the mid-1970s. (C)</p>
                    <p>These are big improvements. There are still a lot of risks ahead,
                        particularly in unstable countries on the periphery of the <gloss

                        December 1976. This improvement was made possible because we had our
                        priorities right: During the campaign you said that the main focus of <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> foreign policy should be on constructive
                        cooperation with our friends. What we have done to this end in Europe and
                        the Middle East has been more important in reducing risk of war than
                        anything that has been, or could have been, accomplished in direct dealings
                        with the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>. (C)</p>
                    <p>Substantial progress has also been made in those dealings, however; the main
                        advantage of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>-II may be in paving the

                        agreement, in which we can get at the principal cause of nuclear
                        instability: technological change. This argues for seeking a <gloss

                        anti-inflation program achieving its goals. This will probably, as I
                        suggested after the London Summit, have to be our central task for the next
                        several years: Like European countries and Japan in the early 1970’s, we
                        will have to stick to tight fiscal and monetary policies, de<pb n="499"
                            facs="0540" xml:id="pg_499"/>spite the pressures that slowing growth and
                        rising unemployment may create for premature reflation. (U)</p>
                    <p>This anti-inflation campaign will, by its nature, call into question some of
                        the other policies described above—e.g., the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> defense build-up, allowing <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss> oil prices to rise to world levels in 1980, and increasing
                        our aid for developing countries. Posing this dilemma doesn’t tell us <hi
                            rend="italic">what</hi> decisions we should make about these problems.
                        But it does suggest <hi rend="italic">how</hi> we should make them. When
                        other industrial countries faced similar choices, we were quick to remind
                        them that their decisions affected us and that we wanted to be consulted.
                        The reverse is even more true, given our central position in the alliance.
                        (C)</p>
                    <p>This won’t be easy: It’s hard enough to make choices within the pluralistic
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> government, let alone involve other
                        countries. Yet it will be the price of holding together the alliance among
                        industrial democracies on which our security and prosperity depends. A
                        defense program that involves less than a 3% increase, an aid program that
                        doesn’t rise as rapidly as we had hoped, oil prices that reach world levels
                        in 1981 rather than 1980—these changes may be manageable. But only if our
                        allies feel that their views and interests have been taken into account, as
                        we make these hard choices in the next two years. (C)</p>

                    <p>The world-awakening to human rights and fundamental freedoms that emerged in
                        1948 in the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has taken
                        on a new urgency in the past few years. For perhaps the first time in
                        history we can truly say that there is a worldwide human rights movement,
                        and it is steadily gaining force.</p>
                    <p>Mahatma Gandhi in 1921 wrote that every good movement passes through five
                        stages: indifference, ridicule, abuse, repression, and, finally, respect. We
                        know that human rights abuses are usually, when first noted, regarded with
                        indifference. Then will come the ridicule, then the abuse, and perhaps even
                        the repression. This is the path of progress. It has been true in the United
                        States, India, across the African <pb n="500" facs="0541" xml:id="pg_500"
                        />Continent. It is no less true in the East or Middle East than it has been
                        in the West and South. It is part of the process of widening participation
                        in the public dialogue, of expanding the concerns and concepts we use when
                        we develop public and international policy.</p>
                    <p>There is no room for self-righteousness and self-congratulation in the field
                        of human rights. Each of our nations has people of vision and people of
                        fear, those who create and those who repress and torture. I believe we
                        should identify particular problems and work together toward solving them.
                        It is better to solve one small problem than to engage in political
                        fireworks about the grand issues of our time. We have the potential of a new
                        pragmatism in these halls, and I hope it grows.</p>
                    <p>Behind this new pragmatism is, I think, the growing realization that we,
                        indeed, have common goals and that if we stop fearing and fighting each
                        other we might find some practical solutions. The task is too serious to
                        waste our effort in nonproductive exercises. We are faced with the necessity
                        of promoting worldwide rapid, peaceful social change if we are to move
                        toward the goals of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
                    <p>In 1967, a few months before his death, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,
                        reflected on the next steps of the struggle for full human rights and came
                        to the conclusion that the crisis of the modern world is international in
                        scope and that this is a crisis that “involves the poor, the dispossessed,
                        and the exploited of the whole world.”<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">King
                            delivered these remarks as part of five lectures he delivered for the

                    <p>Today, more than 1 billion people live in conditions of abject
                        poverty—starving, idle, and numbed by ignorance. Life expectancy in the
                        poorest countries is only slightly greater than half that in the
                        industrialized countries.</p>
                    <p>The sad fact is that most of the people in these countries who were born in
                        the year we adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are not around
                        anymore to celebrate this occasion. And most of those who are still here
                        have very little to celebrate. Three quarters of their number in these
                        countries do not have access to safe water. They cannot read the speeches we
                        make today honoring human rights. They earn less money in a year than most
                        of us in this hall of the United Nations earn in 1 day—and even that is only
                        a figure of speech, since most of them have never been paid at all for their
                        work.</p>
                    <p>The birthright of these people has been disregarded, denied, and violated,
                        although it was done not by torturers, not by jailers, not by persecution,
                        and not by repressive government. As President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> re<pb n="501" facs="0542" xml:id="pg_501"/>minded us
                        a week ago: “Hunger, disease, poverty are enemies of human potential which
                        are as relentless as any repressive government.”<note n="3" xml:id="d103fn3"
                            >Made at a ceremony on Dec. 6, 1978, commemorating the adoption of the
                            Universal Declaration (for full text, see BULLETIN of Jan. 1979, p. 1)
                            [Footnote in the original. The President’s address is printed as <ref

                    </p>
                    <p>The freedoms from arbitrariness, torture, and cruel punishment are the rights
                        of everyone by the simple fact that he or she is born. The freedom of
                        thought, speech, religion, press, and participation in public affairs are so
                        fundamental that they enhance the quality of our life and character as
                        individuals. Their exercise cannot be made dependent on any other
                        considerations. But we must understand too that these rights are hollow for
                        any individual who starves to death. Therefore, the human rights struggle is
                        not only a defense of our individual liberty but also a struggle to protect
                        life.</p>
                    <p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a call for worldwide movements
                        to promote human rights. This call is often heard with alarm by many who
                        believe that there is far more to lose than to gain by encouraging
                        political, economic, and social change. Perhaps, in the short run, there is
                        some cost for those who have special privilege or for those who have an
                        investment in thinking of themselves—as a nation or class or race—as
                        superior or more advanced than others. But the plain lesson of history is
                        that as the circle of participation in society widens, almost everyone
                        profits. They profit not just in a better standard of living for everyone
                        but in the productivity of the economy, in better social services for
                        everyone, in wider political participation, and in more freedom and more
                        protection for human rights.</p>
                    <p>The process of change entails risks. But change is inevitable. It is not a
                        question of being able to withstand change or even of directing it; it is a
                        question of understanding change and cooperating with it. The change of our
                        time, the basic dynamic of our time, leads to more participation by more
                        people in society. Poverty is the basic obstacle to the realization of human
                        rights for most people in the world today. Where poverty is the problem,
                        participation is the answer, participation in the economic life of the
                        society. Economic growth must be pursued with equity in mind and not just
                        for the profit of the few at the top or for the power of the state and the
                        government. The ultimate goal of economic development must be equity, with
                        broader participation in production and consumption by all as the main
                        objective. Speaking before the opening session of the 8th General Assembly
                        of the Organization of American States [June 21, 1978], President <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> said: “The challenge <pb n="502"
                            facs="0543" xml:id="pg_502"/>of economic development is to help the
                        world’s poor lift themselves out of misery.”<note n="4" xml:id="d103fn4">The

                    </p>
                    <p>He called upon that Assembly to join together the concepts of economic
                        development and social justice: “We must also devote our common energies to
                        economic development and the cause of social justice. Benefits of the
                        world’s economy must be more fairly shared, but the responsibilities must be
                        shared as well.”</p>
                    <p>To share responsibility is to make more participation possible. The more
                        participation, the wiser will be the government. Prime Minister Manley made
                        a stirring affirmation of his own faith in democracy when he spoke to us in
                        October. He was, you will recall, urging us to united efforts in the
                        struggle against apartheid. He said: “We believe that any government which
                        has the courage to mobilize its people and tell the truth will receive the
                        overwhelming support of its citizens.” I also believe that. We must let our
                        people hear the truth, the whole truth. And we must not be afraid to
                        mobilize our citizens to participate more fully in the political and
                        economic processes.</p>
                    <p>Expanding participation should not be limited, however, to government
                        initiative. There is an important role for nongovernmental organizations.
                        For the last year the Government of India has been reminding us of the
                        importance of autonomous—and I stress that word—autonomous national human
                        rights institutions.</p>
                    <p>We need not fear change if we build into it more equity and more
                        participation. Indeed, fear of social change is the thing we need to fear
                        the most. If we are afraid of it and try to preserve that which is already
                        eroding beneath our feet, we will fail, because the dynamic of history is to
                        widen the circle of those who participate in society. Whether the struggle
                        is for medical care for those who do not have it, bread for those who are
                        hungry, freedom from prison for those imprisoned for conscience’s sake,
                        freedom of the press to print dissenting opinions, a job for those who are
                        unemployed, the right to self-determination of majorities oppressed by
                        minorities, the right of workers to organize, the right to speak one’s own
                        language in one’s own school—all of these are demands for more participation
                        and more dignity.</p>
                    <p>If we invest just half as much energy and imagination in building a world
                        community of the people as we have wasted in resisting the aspirations of
                        the people, we will overcome.</p>
                    <p>I believe that we are at the end of the period of cold wars, in the middle of
                        the era of detente, and just beginning to find ways to build the structures
                        of cooperation. Cooperation will demand a different sub<pb n="503"
                            facs="0544" xml:id="pg_503"/>stance and different style than
                        confrontation. It will take a while for us to learn how to change, and I am
                        afraid that we will all carry with us for some years some of the
                        characteristics of confrontational politics. But it is more rewarding for
                        everyone, even if it is more difficult and demanding, to practice the art of
                        building community and cooperation for the common good. I believe we can get
                        just as excited about building something as we can about protecting
                        something. I believe that cooperation for the common good of humankind can
                        be as powerful an incentive to our imaginations as fear for our survival.
                        Indeed, I submit that cooperation for the common good, for the protection
                        and promotion of human rights, is the way to survival.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps some neglected methods can be of great help to us in the struggle to
                        promote and protect human rights.</p>
                    <p>First, an emphasis on autonomous, national institutions. We have not given
                        due credit, nor due attention, to the creative role of independent, private
                        institutions, dedicated to the protection and promotion of human rights. My
                        own experience was with the civil rights movement and the churches of this
                        country, and I know what they were able to do in a few short years. Also,
                        the role of a free and responsible press needs to be recognized. The press
                        can be a guardian of the public interest and a critic of the abuses—where
                        they exist—of public power, and of private power, for that matter.</p>
                    <p>A second way to promote human rights is the use of the United Nations and of
                        government authority and influence as a catalyst and agent of goodwill in
                        stimulating a process of participation by those who have common interests
                        and concerns. The United Nations and interested nations are doing this in
                        the case of Zimbabwe and Namibia, where the effort is not to impose a
                        solution but to facilitate the building of communication among all the
                        parties which are concerned, so that by talking to one another they learn to
                        formulate their own solutions to their own problems.</p>
                    <p>This is what the United States has been trying to do in the Middle East;
                        acting not as a judge between Egypt and Israel but as a mediator, trying to
                        be a catalyst in a process of ever-expanding conversation and cooperation.
                        This is what the United States, the Dominican Republic, and Guatemala are
                        trying to do in Nicaragua; not the imposition of an external answer but the
                        strengthening of the process of consultation among all parties involved so
                        they can find their own answers.<note n="5" xml:id="d103fn5">Reference is to
                            the ongoing tripartite mediation efforts in Nicaragua.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I believe we can be even more active in this way than we have been at the
                        United Nations. It is not enough to halt conflicts and to provide buffer or
                        peacekeeping forces. It is not enough to denounce problems <pb n="504"
                            facs="0545" xml:id="pg_504"/>or supposed culprits. We must find a
                        positive, creative role, of being the catalyst of change, of promoting the
                        process of wider participation where there are conflicts so that all the
                        parties are involved.</p>
                    <p>In the struggle to make all people free, we ourselves must become free.
                        Freedom is not some distant state of affairs when there will be no more
                        problems and history will have arrived at some utopia, some paradise, some
                        order of perfect justice. Freedom is solidarity with those who are less free
                        than we are. Freedom is taking the risk of working for social justice for
                        all people.</p>
                    <p>The United Nations was brought forth as a result of the struggle for freedom
                        against tyranny. There are many forms of tyranny, and none of us are exempt
                        from the temptation to conspire with tyranny against freedom by remaining
                        indifferent to the struggle of others to be free. But our very humanity
                        rests in our capacity to identify with the other and to join in the struggle
                        to make all persons free.</p>
                    <p>The United Nations is now challenged to take the next steps that can move us
                        forward in the struggle of humankind for peace, justice, and freedom. If we
                        accept this challenge, I believe we will all be free someday.</p>

                            peacefully would not be contradicted by China, and that we would sell

                        BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA</p>
                    <p rend="center">JANUARY 1, 1979</p>
                    <p>The United States of America and the People’s Republic of China have agreed
                        to recognize each other and to establish diplomatic relations as of January
                        1, 1979.</p>
                    <p>The United States of America recognizes the Government of the People’s
                        Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China. Within this
                        context, the people of the United States will maintain cultural, commercial,
                        and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>The United States of America and the People’s Republic of China reaffirm the
                        principles agreed on by the two sides in the Shanghai Communique<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d104fn2">See <ref target="#d29fn6">footnote 6, Document
                            29</ref>.</note> and emphasize once again that:</p>
                    <p>—Both wish to reduce the danger of international military conflict.</p>
                    <p>—Neither should seek hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region or in any other
                        region of the world and each is opposed to efforts by any other country or
                        group of countries to establish such hegemony.</p>
                    <p>—Neither is prepared to negotiate on behalf of any third party or to enter
                        into agreements or understandings with the other directed at other
                        states.</p>
                    <p>—The Government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese
                        position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China.</p>
                    <p>—Both believe that normalization of Sino-American relations is not only in
                        the interest of the Chinese and American peoples but also contributes to the
                        cause of peace in Asia and the world.</p>
                    <p>The United States of America and the People’s Republic of China will exchange
                        Ambassadors and establish Embassies on March 1, 1979.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday, our country and the People’s Republic of China reached this final
                        historic agreement. On January 1, 1979, a little more than 2 weeks from now,
                        our two Governments will implement full normalization of diplomatic
                        relations.</p>
                    <p>As a nation of gifted people who comprise about one-fourth of the total
                        population of the Earth, China plays, already, an important role in world
                        affairs, a role that can only grow more important in the years ahead.</p>
                    <pb n="506" facs="0547" xml:id="pg_506"/>
                    <p>We do not undertake this important step for transient tactical or expedient
                        reasons. In recognizing the People’s Republic of China, that it is the
                        single Government of China, we are recognizing simple reality. But far more
                        is involved in this decision than just the recognition of a fact.</p>
                    <p>Before the estrangement of recent decades, the American and the Chinese
                        people had a long history of friendship. We’ve already begun to rebuild some
                        of those previous ties. Now our rapidly expanding relationship requires the
                        kind of structure that only full diplomatic relations will make
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>The change that I’m announcing tonight will be of great long-term benefit to
                        the peoples of both our country and China—and, I believe, to all the peoples
                        of the world. Normalization—and the expanded commercial and cultural
                        relations that it will bring—will contribute to the well-being of our own
                        Nation, to our own national interest, and it will also enhance the stability
                        of Asia. These more positive relations with China can beneficially affect
                        the world in which we live and the world in which our children will
                        live.</p>
                    <p>We have already begun to inform our allies and other nations and the Members
                        of the Congress of the details of our intended action. But I wish also
                        tonight to convey a special message to the people of Taiwan—I have already
                        communicated with the leaders in Taiwan—with whom the American people have
                        had and will have extensive, close, and friendly relations. This is
                        important between our two peoples.</p>
                    <p>As the United States asserted in the Shanghai Communique of 1972, issued on
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>’s historic visit, we
                        will continue to have an interest in the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan
                        issue. I have paid special attention to ensuring that normalization of
                        relations between our country and the People’s Republic will not jeopardize
                        the well-being of the people of Taiwan. The people of our country will
                        maintain our current commercial, cultural, trade, and other relations with
                        Taiwan through nongovernmental means. Many other countries in the world are
                        already successfully doing this.</p>
                    <p>These decisions and these actions open a new and important chapter in our
                        country’s history and also in world affairs.</p>
                    <p>To strengthen and to expedite the benefits of this new relationship between
                        China and the United States, I am pleased to announce that Vice Premier
                            <persName corresp="#p_TH_2">Teng</persName> has accepted my invitation
                        and will visit Washington at the end of January.<note n="3" xml:id="d104fn3"

                    <p>These events are the final result of long and serious negotiations begun by
                        President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> in 1972, and

                    <p>The normalization of relations between the United States and China has no

                    <p>On December 15, 1978, following his address to the nation regarding the
                        normalization of relations with China (see <ref target="#d104">Document
                            104</ref>), President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Jimmy
                            Carter</persName> spoke to reporters assembled in the White House
                        Briefing Room. The President began his remarks by underscoring the
                        historical importance of the announcement:</p>
                    <p>“It’s something that I and my two predecessors have sought avidly. We have
                        maintained our own United States position firmly, and only since the last
                        few weeks has there been an increasing demonstration to us that Premier
                            <persName corresp="#p_HG_2">Hua</persName> and Vice Premier <persName
                            corresp="#p_TH_2">Teng</persName> have been ready to normalize
                        relations. I think the interests of Taiwan have been adequately protected.
                        One of the briefers will explain the details to you.”</p>
                    <p>The President then noted that he had spoken with Japanese Prime Minister
                            <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> and that the administration
                        had also notified Taiwanese leaders and Soviet Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAF_1">Anatoly Dobrynin</persName>. He continued:</p>
                    <p>“My own assessment is that this will be well received in almost every nation
                        of the world, perhaps all of them, because it will add to stability. And the
                        Soviets and others know full well, because of our own private explanations
                        to them, not just recently but in months gone by, that we have no desire
                        whatsoever to use our new relationships with China to the disadvantage of
                        the Soviets or anyone else. We believe this will enhance stability and not
                        cause instability in Asia and the rest of the world.</p>
                    <p>“I’m very pleased with it. And I obviously have to give a major part of the

                        President <persName corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>, who laid the
                        groundwork for this successful negotiation. And most of the premises that
                        were spelled out in the Shanghai Communiqué 6 years ago or more have been
                        implemented now.</p>

                        accurate explanation of the results.”</p>
                    <p>The President replied to one question about the reaction of the congressional
                        leadership to the announcement before indicating that he would answer one
                        additional question. Answering a question about the Taiwanese response, the
                        President commented:</p>
                    <p>“I doubt if there will be massive applause in Taiwan, but we are going to do
                        everything we can to assure the Taiwanese that we put at top—as one of the
                        top priorities in our own relationships with the People’s Republic and
                        them—that the well-being of the people of Taiwan will not be damaged.</p>
                    <p>“To answer the other question, I don’t think this will have any adverse
                        effect at all on the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> negotiations as
                        an independent matter. And I think that the Soviets, as I said earlier, have
                        been expecting this development. They were not surprised, and we have kept
                        them informed recently. Their reaction has not been adverse, and we will
                        proceed aggressively as we have in recent months, in fact throughout my own
                        administration, to conclude a successful <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> agreement.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName

                    <p>On December 19, at 4:30 p.m., the President participated in a taped interview
                        for broadcast on the <gloss target="#t_CBS_1">CBS</gloss> television
                        network. <gloss target="#t_CBS_1">CBS</gloss> Evening News anchor <persName
                            corresp="#p_CW_1">Walter Cronkite</persName> conducted the interview
                        from the <gloss target="#t_CBS_1">CBS</gloss> studios in New York; the
                        President was in the Map Room at the White House. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CW_1">Cronkite</persName> began the interview by noting that
                        the United States had not received any commitment from the government in
                        Beijing that it would not “use force to take Taiwan.” He asked the President
                        if the current, or a subsequent, government in China attempted
                        reunification, would the United States deploy force to help the Taiwanese
                        resist. <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> responded:</p>
                    <p>“In the first place, the People’s Republic of China does not have the
                        capability of launching a 120-mile attack across the ocean against Taiwan,
                        who are heavily fortified and also heavily armed. And we have made it clear
                        to the People’s Republic that after this year, when the treaty does expire,
                        this coming year, that we will sell to Taiwan defensive weapons.</p>
                    <p>“I think it is accurate to say also, Walter, that the major interest that the
                        People’s Republic of China has in the Western Pacific is peace and good
                        relationships with us. They know our firm expectations, clearly expressed to
                        them, that the differences between China and Taiwan will be settled
                        peacefully. And I think to violate that understanding with us would be to
                        wipe out all the benefits to them and to Asia of peace and their new
                        relationship with us.</p>
                    <p>“We have, obviously, a desire and a commitment to maintain peace in the
                        Western Pacific. And as would be the case with an alterca<pb n="509"
                            facs="0550" xml:id="pg_509"/>tion between any two peoples, we would
                        certainly be deeply concerned. But I don’t want to speculate on under what
                        circumstances we might take military action because I think it’s an
                        absolutely unnecessary speculation, because the people of China want peace,
                        they want good relationships with us, and because Taiwan is so strong and
                        will stay strong.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Cronkite</persName> then asked the President
                        several questions about the Soviet response to the decision, the upcoming
                        visits of Chinese officials, and the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty
                            (<gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>) before addressing reactions
                        some members of Congress had concerning the announcement:</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Cronkite</persName>. Mr. President, some
                        Members of Congress, including Democrats and some liberal Republicans, are
                        claiming that you failed to live up to an administration pledge to consult
                        with Congress before taking any such action as you have toward Taiwan and
                        Peking. And now, there’s a threat of a court challenge to the
                        constitutionality of your cancelling the treaty without congressional
                        approval. How seriously do you view this? Do you feel that either Congress
                        or the courts could block this arrangement with both Taiwan and Peking?</p>
                    <p>“The President. No. My constitutional responsibility in establishing
                        relationships with foreign countries is clear and cannot be successfully
                        challenged in court.</p>
                    <p>“We have had constant consultations with the Congress over the past 2 years.
                        And our goal in establishing normal relations with China has been made clear
                        on numerous occasions by me personally. When Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> went to China and came back, he gave
                        the Congress leaders and Members a thorough briefing. Dr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> did the same thing after his
                        visit to China. I have met with all the Members of Congress who would come
                        to sessions here at the White House.</p>
                    <p>“One of the deliberate items on my own agenda in explaining to them and
                        answering their questions was about the terms under which we would normalize
                        relationships with China. I might add that when numerous delegations of
                        congressional leaders have gone to the People’s Republic and come back, they
                        have also given me and Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                            >Vance</persName> their views on what ought to be done. Almost
                        invariably their recommendation was to proceed expeditiously with
                        normalization of relations with China.</p>
                    <p>“So, there’s been a clear understanding, really ever since 1972, of the
                        policy of our Government toward China, a desire to normalize relations, and
                        also a clear expression of my views both publicly and privately to the
                        Members of Congress about our goals and the plans for accomplishing this
                        goal.</p>
                    <p>“I might say in complete candor that in the last 2 or 3 weeks, when the
                        negotiations were building up to a climax in an unanticipated degree of
                        rapidity of movement, we did not consult with anyone outside <pb n="510"
                            facs="0551" xml:id="pg_510"/>of a very tiny group within the executive
                        branch of Government about the prospective success. But what did happen
                        should not be a surprise to anyone. The congressional views were well known
                        to me. My views were well known to the Members of Congress.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Cronkite</persName>. Mr. President, what was
                        the need for such haste? Why could you not have consulted with the
                        congressional leaders first, before making the final commitment?</p>
                    <p>“The President. Well, Walter, my experience in negotiating sensitive and
                        complicated agreements with foreign leaders, including the experience at
                        Camp David and otherwise, is that to negotiate through the news media,
                        through public pronouncements and with wide divergencies of views expressed
                        by different leaders in a country, is not conducive to success. And I’m
                        authorized and directed by the Constitution and my responsibility is to
                        conduct negotiations of this kind.</p>
                    <p>“We did not depart from the established policy of our country that’s been
                        extant since President <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> went to
                        China in 1972. And I think had we caused a public debate in our country
                        about all the ramifications of the negotiations at the very time we were
                        trying to conclude these discussions with the Chinese, it would have
                        resulted in failure. And our country would have lost a wonderful opportunity
                        to a great stride forward and all the benefits that will be derived from
                        this agreement.</p>
                    <p>“So, I don’t have any doubt that what I did was right and correct. I don’t
                        have any doubts that had we made a public issue of it, it would have
                        complicated the issue unnecessarily.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Cronkite</persName> followed <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>’s answer with a question regarding
                        the U.S.–Taiwan Defense Treaty, before concluding the interview with a
                        question related to the Senate’s confirmation of the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II treaty:</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CW_1">Cronkite</persName>. Do you think that
                        putting the Chinese question on the agenda of the next session of Congress
                        might complicate the confirmation of a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> treaty?</p>
                    <p>“The President. No, I think not. What we will ask the Congress to do next
                        session is to pass special legislation to permit us to continue our cultural
                        relations with Taiwan, our trade relations with Taiwan, the application of
                        the Eximbank, and the support of loans to China—to the people of Taiwan,
                        rather, and also to authorize us to sell weapons to Taiwan after the defense
                        treaty expires.</p>
                    <p>“So, I think that even those who oppose the normalization of relations with
                        China will favor the continued relationships with Taiwan, which this
                        legislation will have to authorize. So, I don’t think this will complicate
                        the other issues in Congress. They’re almost as complicated as they can get
                        anyhow. I don’t think this will hurt at all.” (Ibid., pages 2275–2279)</p>

                        that this Administration does not have any overall scheme, and that the
                        United States is no longer prepared to use its power to protect its
                        interests or to impose its will on the flow of history. (S)</p>
                    <p>It is, therefore, quite critical that you use the meeting in order to share
                        with your colleagues your thinking, especially on the level of high
                        strategy, in addition to much more specific discussion of such issues as

                    <p>I believe that as we enter 1979, you, quite literally, have a historic chance
                        to start shaping a new global system, with the United States as its
                        predominant coordinator if no longer the paramount power. The fulfillment of
                        that opportunity depends critically on how you play the China/Soviet Union
                        issues, and also on how you respond to the deteriorating situation along the

                    <p>The key issue is how you perceive and handle the U.S.-Soviet relationship,

                        There are different views of handling U.S.-Soviet relations, and important
                        consequences flow from these differences. Your policy, as it has evolved

                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Confrontation</hi>, or renewed Cold War (e.g., <persName

                        confrontation advocated almost as an end in itself. The key weakness of this
                        approach is that the United States would eventually find itself alone in
                        taking on the Russians, for this is too simplistic an image for the
                        increasingly complex world. (S)</p>

                    <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Condominium</hi>, based on a balance of power to
                        preserve the status quo (e.g., <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                            >Nixon</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>):
                        This approach is based on the essentially pessimistic view that the West is
                        in decline and that the best we can do is to prevent change in the central
                        areas, while letting the Soviets win in the less important peripheries. The
                        key weakness of this approach is that the world is too dynamic to sustain an
                        essentially reactionary balance-of-power policy, while the “condominium”
                        would be bitterly resented by everyone else, and thus would backfire
                        strongly against our own alliance relationships. (S)</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Simply a Partnership</hi> as the centerpiece of U.S.
                        foreign policy (e.g., McGovern): According to this view, a U.S.-Soviet
                        partnership on a broad front, starting with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss>, will be the basis for world peace, and hence it ought to
                        be the centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy. The key weakness of this
                        approach, much as of the one above, is that it frightens our friends and
                        allies, be they the West Europeans, Japanese, and lately the Chinese, and it
                        can be easily translated into appeasement. Indeed, typical of this approach
                        is its concomitant unwillingness even to criticize the Soviets either for
                        their militant intrusion into Africa or for their excessive strategic
                        build-up; as well as its willingness to give gratis assurances on the
                        Chinese, asking nothing in return. In effect, alternatives 2 and 3 elevate
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> into a global partner of the
                        United States, while giving the Soviets a hunting license to exploit global
                        turbulence to their advantage. (S)</p>
                    <p>Your policy, if I understand it correctly, seeks: (S)</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Reciprocal Accommodation</hi>, which means (1)
                        containment, (2) resistance to indirect expansion, (3) ideological
                        competition, and, most important and above all, (4) creation of a framework
                            <hi rend="italic">within which</hi> the Soviet Union can accommodate
                        with us, or face the prospect of isolating itself globally. This offers the
                        best hope for the United States and for our values, and it avoids the risks
                        inherent in the three other approaches mentioned above because it seeks to
                        fit the U.S.-Soviet relationship into a cooperative context of
                        U.S.-European-Japanese, and now also Chinese, relations. (S)</p>
                    <p>What does the fourth approach mean in practice? (S)</p>
                    <p>1. It means keeping open the option to the Soviets for genuine global
                        cooperation with the United States, but doing so in a patient fashion. I
                        think that we have made a mistake in putting so many deadlines on <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and on Brezhnev’s visit here; that
                        simply conveys over-anxiousness, the Soviets can exploit that against us,
                        and we hurt ourselves domestically. We should stress to the Soviets that we
                        are prepared to be patient, that there is a constructive place for them in a
                        wider framework of international cooperation, that there are many global
                        issues on which we could cooperate, and that we are prepared to seek detente
                        and cooperation on the basis of genuine reciprocity, as in<pb n="513"
                            facs="0554" xml:id="pg_513"/>dicated in your Annapolis speech.<note

                        And, if that reciprocity is missing, as it has been on Africa, Cuba, and the
                        Persian Gulf, we are prepared to assert our interests. (S)</p>
                    <p>2. It means cooperating with Europe and Japan in drawing China into a more
                        genuine involvement in global cooperation, pointing toward a world of
                        diversity. You should explain to <persName corresp="#p_TH_2"
                        >Teng</persName>, and also to the “Gang of Guadeloupe,” that diversity is
                        the same thing as non-hegemony; i.e., pluralism. In that sense we have
                        genuinely compatible strategic objectives with the Europeans, Japanese, <hi
                            rend="italic">and</hi> the Chinese. This compatibility has to be
                        cultivated cautiously but consistently. Moreover, if the Chinese were to
                        sense that we are timid, or that we are using them only to obtain a better
                        bargain for a bilateral accommodation with the Soviets, they could swing
                        quickly to the other extreme. (S)</p>
                    <p>3. It means facing up to the danger that the Soviet military build-up is
                        likely to intersect with regional instability. In fact, it has already
                        started doing so, first in Africa, and now, and potentially much more
                        dangerously, in the Persian Gulf. (S)</p>
                    <p>The required response involves <hi rend="italic">not</hi> giving the Soviets
                        gratis guarantees on China. Whenever the Soviets ask for assurances
                        regarding China, we should be responsive by saying that we do not intend to
                        exploit China against the Soviet Union, but couple that with a pointed
                        request for the withdrawal of Cubans from Africa and for a halt to Soviet
                        activities in the Persian Gulf. (S)</p>
                    <p>In any case, we should not allow ourselves to be drawn into sponsoring a
                        blockade of China from defensive West European arms, since a strong and
                        secure China is an essential contribution to global stability, and the
                        Chinese are entitled to acquire defensive arms from the West. (In the past,
                        the Soviets were not shy about arming the Chinese against us.) (S)</p>
                    <p>4. It requires a U.S. military posture which is adequate to balance the
                        Soviet Union through essential equivalence and adequate collective
                        conventional forces. In brief, it means carrying out <gloss target="#t_PD_1"

                    <p>5. It means affirming our position on human rights, which greatly increases
                        the moral appeal of the United States and provides an effective response to
                        Soviet ideology. (S)</p>
                    <p>There is no doubt the global yearning for human rights is ready to be tapped,
                        and you have started tapping it in a genuinely important fashion. I notice

                    <p>6. With regard to the arc of instability along the Indian Ocean, we need to
                        respond collectively, and that is a fitting subject for a special discussion
                        in Guadeloupe. In the meantime, we may have to take some steps to convince
                        the Soviets that we will back our friends in Iran, come what may. The
                        disintegration of Iran, with Iran repeating the experience of Afghanistan,
                        would be the most massive American defeat since the beginning of the Cold
                        War, overshadowing in its <hi rend="italic">real consequences</hi> the
                        setback in Vietnam. (S)</p>
                    <p>7. It means, finally, making a basic decision on whether we will seek a
                        breakthrough to peace in the Middle East sometime in the first half of 1979.
                        The West Europeans can help us, if you choose to push hard, and we should
                        make an early decision on this matter. I fear that without such an effort,
                        the Middle East will become increasingly radicalized as it accommodates
                        itself to the reality of U.S. inability to obtain a wider settlement and
                        perhaps also to provide protection to the region from the Soviets. There is
                        a subtle interaction between the problem of Iran, Turkey, and the Middle
                        East, and a United States lead on these issues is quite necessary. You have
                        been pointing in the right direction, and we should now mobilize our allies
                        for more overt support on behalf of our efforts. These efforts, moreover,
                        should be fitted into the larger framework which I have sketched out above.

                    <p>If you agree, some comments to that effect at Guadeloupe might provide your

                        desirable, for in either case the yearning for American leadership must

                    <p>Newly analyzed evidence on foreign opinion toward the U.S. and the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> indicates that adverse trends, dating
                        back nearly two decades, have been reversed in the last several years. From
                        the early 1960s until the mid 1970s, sympathy for America was eroded by
                        Vietnam and Watergate, while distrust of the Soviet Union was eroded by
                        detente. As a result, the earlier favorable gap between Soviet and American
                        standing in the eyes of European and Japanese publics narrowed dramatically.
                        More recently, however, scattered but quite consistent polling results
                        suggest that U.S. standing is beginning to recover, though it remains below
                        the highs of the early 1960s, while Soviet standing by contrast has
                        plummeted to depths unequalled in nearly two decades. (U)</p>
                    <p>The changes now apparently underway in Europe and Japan suggest that the U.S.
                        is recapturing the political-ideological initiative that had slipped to the
                        Soviets during the 1960s. In a parallel development, <pb n="515" facs="0556"
                            xml:id="pg_515"/>the Department of State has recently reported that the

                        steadily since 1974. Taken together with the changes in foreign opinion,
                        this evidence suggests that—whatever the ups and downs of day-to-day
                        alliance affairs—the psychological underpinnings of our central alliances
                        are in improving shape. (U)</p>

                        should therefore have priority over all other foreign policy concerns. Their

                        leadership position of the United States. Setbacks would be very damaging to
                        our relationships abroad and the Administration’s ability to gain domestic
                        support on other foreign policy issues.</p>
                    <p>We should plan our other foreign policy initiatives in this context. The

                    <p>At the same time we should keep in mind the shape of our policies as a whole,
                        and the impression they convey. Two years ago, we recognized that the U.S.
                        must manage a broad foreign policy agenda, including, in addition to the
                        core security issues, new emphasis on concerns such as nuclear
                        non-proliferation, human rights, limiting conventional arms sales, and
                        development in the Third World.<note n="3" xml:id="d107fn3">The President

                    <p>It will be important that we maintain these goals, however we may shape our
                        priorities and tactics during the next two years. Our human rights policies
                        may come under increasing attack in certain domestic circles if friendly but
                        authoritarian governments, where human rights have been an issue, give way
                        to more radical or less friendly rule. Our nuclear non-proliferation
                        concerns may well come under increasing pressure abroad. Without significant
                        progress in gaining multilateral restraint, our unilateral conventional arms
                        sales policies will become vulnerable. But, in each case, our goals are very
                        important. We have been making progress on each issue. And our constancy on
                        each is critical to our general credibility, even as we make pragmatic
                        decisions about our tactics.<note n="4" xml:id="d107fn4">The President

                        our benefit by injecting increasing vitality and life into our alliance

                        during the next year or two, as the financial resources we can use to
                        support our diplomacy become more constrained, we need to help our public
                        think all the more in terms of Western interests, influence, and power
                        rather than exclusively in terms of U.S. interests, influence and power. Our
                        diplomacy in Africa and Europe over the past two years, for example with

                        emphasize excessively Soviet strengths and gains in our own statements.<note

                    <list>
                        <item>—Concrete decisions will be required of leaders in the West Bank and

                        bilateral treaty. Polarization between Egypt/Israel and the rest of the
                        Arabs might also lead our European allies into increasingly pro-Arab
                        positions. Moreover, we could be forced to consider allying ourselves with
                        the Saudis to a degree we have not contemplated before in order to preserve
                        as much as possible of our bilateral relationship. This itself could cause

                        that we will gain approval, but there will probably be attempts to add
                        reservations or amendments (for example directing certain types of arms

                    <p>We should plan to conclude a number of basic agreements with Peking in 1979
                        which will enable us to expand our trade and exchange relationships.
                        Settlement of claims/assets issues, a consular agreement, and formal
                        bilateral agreements on some of the science and technical areas where we
                        have already made progress are practicable. Given Peking’s present mood of
                        looking outward, particularly toward the West, we can also try to draw the
                        Chinese more actively into several international issues, for example on
                        refugees and disarmament, where they have showed reluctance in the past. Our
                        decisions on technology transfer and on arms sales by our allies, however,
                        are particularly sensitive in terms of the balance we want to maintain with
                        the Soviets. We should move with great care in both these areas.</p>

                    <p>Success in these renegotiations—and the context of the Review Conference—will
                        be strongly affected by the results of the <gloss target="#t_INFCE_1"
                            >INFCE</gloss>, scheduled for completion in February, 1980; by progress
                        in arms control negotiations among the nuclear powers; by the confidence
                        potential proliferators like Korea and Taiwan have in their security and our
                        assurances; and by attitudes toward the U.S. as a reliable nuclear fuel and
                        technology supplier.</p>
                    <p>If the <gloss target="#t_INFCE_1">INFCE</gloss> results are inconclusive, and
                        we do not have a good case to make on arms control among the nuclear powers,
                        we could easily see a backlash against the <gloss target="#t_NPT_1"
                            >NPT</gloss> at the Review Conference. A number of the more than 100
                        nations which have ratified the Treaty could renounce it.</p>
                    <p>Particularly important, both for the Review Conference and the Indian

                        then consider whether, rather than moving promptly for ratification, we

                    <p>It is now 1 month since the President announced that the United States and

                        and outline what we believe it means for the United States and for the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>Few other foreign policy issues have so long divided Americans as “the China
                        question.” In the 1930’s, Americans became deeply aware and often
                        passionately concerned with the tragedy and suffering of China. In the early
                        1940’s, our two nations fought together against the Axis Powers. In the late
                        1940’s we tried—ultimately without success—to help the two sides in the
                        Chinese civil war find a peaceful settlement to their conflict.</p>
                    <p>Relations between the People’s Republic of China and the United States
                        reached a nadir in the 1950’s. Our armies clashed in Korea, and at home the
                        China issue left a deep mark on the domestic political landscape. One of the
                        tragedies of that period was the destruction of the careers of some
                        outstanding Foreign Service officers because they reported events in Asia as
                        they saw them.</p>
                    <p>The impasse in our relations with Peking persisted despite the emergence
                        during the 1960’s of incontestable evidence of serious rivalry between the
                        Soviet Union and China. The United States, enmeshed in military involvement
                        in Southeast Asia, and China, preoc<pb n="528" facs="0569" xml:id="pg_528"

                        overcoming our differences.</p>
                    <p>The year 1971 marked the beginning of a new phase. Across a vast gulf of
                        misunderstanding and mutual distrust, the Governments of Peking and the
                        United States began a dialogue, starting with <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Henry Kissinger</persName>’s dramatic trip to Peking in 1971 and

                    <p>But that dialogue was incomplete. The United States still formally recognized
                        the Republic of China—whose de facto control encompassed only Taiwan and a
                        few adjacent islands—as the legal Government of China. Despite this, we were
                        able to begin contacts and ultimately, in 1973, even establish Liaison
                        Offices in Washington and Peking.<note n="6" xml:id="d108fn6">The United

                                target="#t_USLO_1">USLO</gloss>).</note> But the nature of the
                        relationship with Peking remained limited in scope and depth by the
                        political, legal, and economic implications of our lack of mutual
                        recognition.</p>
                    <p>Nonrecognition—the delicate state in which we dealt with Peking in the 6
                        years after the Shanghai communique—presented daily practical problems.
                        Although both sides made major efforts to minimize these limitations, they
                        became increasingly inhibiting. Discussions with the Chinese often foundered
                        on the fact that in the absence of recognition, many activities either could
                        not proceed at all or had to be conducted at a low level. Contacts were
                        constrained, including those that might have produced greater understanding
                        on global issues. Trade was limited, and opportunities often would go
                        elsewhere. Legal problems hung over commercial transactions because of
                        American claims and frozen P.R.C. assets dating back to 1950. More
                        importantly, not to try to move forward would have been to risk moving
                        backward—and backward movement in U.S.-Chinese relations would have caused
                        serious damage to our global position.</p>
                    <p>So even before he was inaugurated, President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> made his first China decision. In an act of
                        continuity with two previous Presidents, he reaffirmed the Shanghai
                        communique as the basis for our relationship and specifically reaffirmed its
                        commitment to work toward normal relations.</p>
                    <pb n="529" facs="0570" xml:id="pg_529"/>
                    <p>We were not at all certain at that time that we could, indeed, reach that
                        ultimate goal. But we felt it essential to try, and we were prepared to take
                        as much time as was necessary to achieve it on an acceptable basis.</p>
                    <p>With this in mind, we began discussions within the Administration, as well as
                        an intensive series of consultations both with Members of Congress and with
                        a wide cross-section of American businessmen, scholars, and others. From our
                        consultations and review, two central thrusts, and several specific
                        concerns, emerged.</p>
                    <p>These basic thrusts could not have been clearer. On the one hand, a
                        substantial majority of Americans wished to see the United States and the
                        People’s Republic of China establish diplomatic relations; but at the same
                        time, an equally large majority had deep concerns about Taiwan’s future
                        prosperity, security, and stability. We shared these concerns. The President
                        decided that we would only establish diplomatic relations with Peking if
                        such an action could be accomplished in a way that did not damage the
                        well-being of the people on Taiwan or reduce the chances for a peaceful
                        settlement of the Taiwan question by the Chinese themselves.</p>
                    <p>Beyond these basic considerations, several specific concerns emerged.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> there was widespread and legitimate concern
                        over Peking’s insistence that prior to normalization the United States must
                        unilaterally abrogate the Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan rather than
                        terminate it in accordance with its own provisions, to which the United
                        States and Taiwan had agreed in 1954.<note n="7" xml:id="d108fn7">
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJF_1">Dulles</persName> and <persName

                            in Washington on December 3, 1954. For the text of the treaty, see

                            p. 899.</note> Furthermore, we wished to establish that after
                        normalization, even in the absence of diplomatic relations with Taiwan, all
                        other agreements and treaties would remain in effect.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Second,</hi> we shared with Congress and the American
                        public a deep concern over the strong assertions by Chinese officials
                        concerning their right to “liberate” Taiwan in any way they saw fit. From an
                        American point of view, the peaceful settlement of the Taiwan issue by the
                        Chinese themselves was of critical importance; we could not move forward if
                        Peking continued to talk and think about the Taiwan issue in such
                        inflammatory terms.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Third,</hi> a consensus rapidly emerged, inside and
                        outside the government, that it was essential that we continue a wide range
                        of relations with the people on Taiwan on a nongovernmental basis after
                        normalization. In particular, these postnormalization relations would have
                        to include continued sale of defensive weapons to Taiwan.</p>

                        matters, although on some important issues we continued to have differences.
                        Our discussions on normalization were of an exploratory nature. These

                        normalization has, in fact, enhanced the possibilities that whatever the

                        facilitate ongoing and, we are confident, expanding ties between the
                        American people and the people on Taiwan. Taipei will handle its unofficial
                        relations with this country in similar fashion.</p>
                    <p>Let me say a word or two about the American Institute in Taiwan, the
                        legislation it requires, and its operations. Congress will be asked to
                        approve an omnibus bill that will authorize the funding of the American
                        Institute in Taiwan and confirm its authority to act in a wide range of
                        areas. I hope we will have your active support for expeditious passage of
                        that bill.<note n="13" xml:id="d108fn13">The Taiwan Relations Act (H.R.
                            2479; <gloss target="#t_PL_1">P.L.</gloss> 96–8), which the President
                            signed into law on April 10, authorized the establishment of the
                            American Institute in Taiwan, which allowed the United States to
                            continue to conduct relations with Taiwan. Taiwan would conduct its
                            diplomacy with the United States under the auspices of the Coordination
                            Council for North American Affairs. The Act also maintained various
                            cultural and other links between the two nations. (<hi rend="italic"

                    <p>The institute will have its headquarters in Washington with field offices in
                        Taiwan. It will provide the full range of commercial and other services that
                        have been previously provided through official channels to businessmen, both
                        from the United States and from Taiwan. In your private business dealings on
                        Taiwan, you may freely contact the institute’s staff for advice or can deal
                        directly with local firms and the authorities there. In short, we see no
                        change necessary in the way private American business has been conducted on
                        Taiwan up to now. Eximbank loans, <gloss target="#t_OPIC_1">OPIC</gloss>
                        [Overseas Private Investment Corporation] guarantees, and other important
                        arrangements will continue.</p>
                    <p>With these new arrangements in place, we expect Taiwan to continue to
                        prosper. Taiwan’s dynamic economic growth is one of the most impressive
                        stories of the last decade; it is now our eighth largest trading partner,
                        and per capita income is among the highest in Asia.</p>
                    <p>As anyone who has studied the issue can attest, normalization of relations
                        with Peking was not an easy step to take. The difficulties always argued for
                        themselves, and further delay was always an inviting option for any
                        President. But we all recognized that sooner or later we would have to move.
                        As I have already said, failure to try to move forward would have left us in
                        danger of moving backward—at great cost to our global position. By the time
                        we took the decisive step, every other member of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss>, our two treaty partners in <gloss target="#t_ANZUS_1"
                            >ANZUS</gloss> [Australia and New Zealand], and Japan had long since
                        recognized the P.R.C., as had most other nations of the world. They were
                        ready for our action—and most of them, including all the members of the
                        Association of South East Asian Nations (<gloss target="#t_ASEAN_1"
                            >ASEAN</gloss>), applauded it.</p>
                    <p>When we acted, we did so in a way that enhances significantly the prospects
                        for stability and peace in Asia and the Pacific. We acted in a way that will
                        move us toward our objective of a stable system of independent nations in
                        Asia and that will also increase the chances of maintaining a stable
                        equilibrium among the United States, Japan, China, and the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The United States will continue to play an active role in order to maintain
                        that stable equilibrium. For reasons of geography, history, and economics,
                        we are as much a Pacific nation as an Atlantic nation, with deep and abiding
                        national interests in the region. We will maintain balanced and flexible
                        military forces in the region, as the recent successful conclusion of the
                        base agreements with the Philippines so clearly demonstrates. And we will
                        not hesitate to act, as required, to protect our vital national
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>The rapidly expanding relations between our two nations in science, trade,
                        and exchanges require the kind of structure that diplomatic relations can
                        provide. It will allow a much freer exchange between our cultures. And with
                        full relations, we are in a far better position to en<pb n="533" facs="0574"
                            xml:id="pg_533"/>courage China’s role as a constructive member of the
                        world community. We will be discussing all of these matters with Vice
                        Premier <persName corresp="#p_DX_1">Deng</persName> when he visits us in 2
                            weeks.<note n="14" xml:id="d108fn14">See <ref target="#d104fn3">footnote

                    </p>
                    <p>It is particularly useful on this occasion to note some of the economic
                        benefits we expect to flow from the establishment of diplomatic relations
                        with the P.R.C. These include our participation as a regular supplier of
                        agricultural commodities to China; the ability of U.S. exporters to compete
                        on an equal basis with other suppliers; and the resumption of shipping, air,
                        banking, and other normal economic relations with China.</p>
                    <p>Let me emphasize that in normalizing relations we acted in a way that does
                        not threaten any other nation but can increase the sense of community of
                        nations that we seek to encourage.</p>
                    <p>We believe that China has an important role to play in the search for global
                        peace and stability. The same is true for the Soviet Union. Our national
                        interests are best served when we seek to improve relations with both
                        nations while protecting our vital strategic interests. This was the case
                        during the late winter and spring of 1972, a period during which both the
                        Shanghai communique and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I were
                        achieved. Equilibrium and stability, not isolation, are our strategic
                        objectives. For this reason, we also look forward to the early conclusion of
                        the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement with the Soviet Union
                        and to improvement of our trade relations with the Soviets as well as the
                        Chinese.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, let me urge you to support the President’s decision and the
                        legislation to continue relations with the people on Taiwan. We seek your
                        support in explaining the strategic and historic necessity of this action.
                        And we encourage you to develop greater trade and contact with both the
                        People’s Republic of China and the people on Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>It was just short of 7 years from the Shanghai communique to normalization of
                        relations. Through a difficult period, two great nations began to restore
                        contact and shape a new relationship. We all recognize that a new era is
                        upon us. Opportunities previously denied to us have now begun to take
                        shape.</p>
                    <p>The nations grouped in and around the world’s largest ocean—the
                        Pacific—contain close to half the world’s population. These nations must
                        decide whether to choose the path of greater cooperation and growth or to
                        enter into a period of unresolved struggles for influence.</p>
                    <p>For our part, the United States will enter the closing decades of the 20th
                        century ready to play a leading role in the search for peace and economic
                        well-being. The lack of diplomatic relations between the United States and
                        China was an obstacle to progress for many years. <pb n="534" facs="0575"

                    <p>My purpose is to place our China policy in a wider context. As I address you,
                        a number of troubling developments dominate the headlines.</p>
                    <p>• The Shah of Iran is planning to depart for a rest, leaving behind him a new
                        administration which will seek to return tranquility to an unsettled country
                        in which the United States has an enormous stake.<note n="16"

                    </p>
                    <p>• Vietnam has invaded its neighbor, Cambodia.<note n="17" xml:id="d108fn17"
                            >In late December 1978, Vietnam invaded Cambodia and took Phnom Penh in
                            January 1979.</note> Through an act of aggression, it has imposed a
                        subservient regime upon a Cambodian people wearied of the inhumane, callous
                        rule of <persName corresp="#p_PP_2">Pol Pot</persName>.</p>
                    <p>• Among the first governments to recognize the new Vietnamese-installed
                        regime in Phnom Penh was Afghanistan, a strategically important country
                        which borders on Iran and Pakistan and in which Soviet influence has
                        increased significantly in recent months.</p>
                    <p>• The situation in the Horn of Africa and in South Yemen, Angola, and
                        southern Africa remains uncertain, as Cuban troops continue to promote
                        Soviet interests.</p>
                    <p>• Indeed, all the developing countries in the arc from northeast Asia to
                        southern Africa continue to search for viable forms of government capable of
                        managing the process of modernization. Their instability, uncertainty, and
                        weakness can be exploited and intensified by outside powers.</p>
                    <p>Balanced against these unsettling developments, however, are a number of
                        quieter yet more significant, positive developments.</p>
                    <p>• Progress has been made in bringing peace to the Middle East. The progress
                        is slow and often painful. But through the persistent diplomacy of President
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> and Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>, we are, I believe, inexorably
                        moving toward the realization of the Camp David accords. We are promoting
                        reconciliation to one of the most volatile disputes in the world.</p>
                    <p>• In Latin America, U.S. policy has undergone significant change, and our
                        relations with most countries in the region are at or near all <pb n="535"
                            facs="0576" xml:id="pg_535"/>time highs. The ratification of the Panama
                        Canal treaties was an historical milestone.</p>
                    <p>• We have significantly improved the nature of our relations with black
                        African countries.</p>
                    <p>• Our relations with India have never been better; and we are retaining our
                        ties of friendship with Pakistan.</p>
                    <p>• In East Asia, a delicate balance of power exists favorable to our
                        interests. We have normalized relations with China, in part, to consolidate
                        the balance.</p>
                    <p>• Such regional organizations as <gloss target="#t_ASEAN_1">ASEAN</gloss> and
                        the Organization of African Unity are playing an increasingly positive role
                        in bringing stability to their regions.</p>
                    <p>• In recognition of the growing conventional military capability of the
                        Soviet Union, we are increasing our military expenditures—as are our <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies—to make sure our European
                        defenses remain strong.</p>
                    <p>• While we have not yet managed to establish a more stable world monetary and
                        trading system, we have made progress in recent months in stabilizing the
                        dollar and in creating a more orderly and growing world market through
                        MTN.</p>
                    <p>• We will reach a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II agreement which
                        will place a cap on the deployment of new and more missiles and which
                        introduces a note of stability in the precarious strategic balance between
                        the Soviet Union and the United States.</p>
                    <p>Added to these favorable developments are those of the spirit. After the
                        debilitating decade of Vietnam and Watergate, our people are returning to
                        their social moorings and exhibiting their traditional will and idealism.
                        Worldwide, too, we have once again assumed the mantle of moral leadership,
                        with the importance we attach to human rights, nuclear nonproliferation, and
                        limitation of conventional arms sales. Certainly as much as and probably
                        more than any other major power, the United States is addressing in a
                        forthright manner the problems of our age. We remain an innovative society
                        and a worldwide source of inspiration.</p>
                    <p>These positive developments are the result of the President’s commitment—as
                        he enunciated at Notre Dame more than a year ago—to a policy of constructive
                        global engagement, a policy of trying to influence the changes of our era in
                        directions that are compatible with our interests and values. Under that
                        broad heading, we have crystallized seven fundamental objectives for our
                        foreign policy:</p>
                    <p>• To enhance our military security;</p>
                    <p>• To reinforce our ties with our key allies and promote a more cooperative
                        world system;</p>
                    <pb n="536" facs="0577" xml:id="pg_536"/>
                    <p>• To respond in a positive way to the economic and moral challenge of the
                        so-called North-South relationship;</p>
                    <p>• To improve relations between East and West;</p>
                    <p>• To help resolve the more threatening regional conflicts and tensions;</p>
                    <p>• To cope with such emerging global issues as nuclear proliferation and arms
                        dissemination; and</p>
                    <p>• To reassert traditional American values—especially human rights.</p>
                    <p>At the outset, I should note that American foreign policy confronts a
                        fundamental analytical question: Are the issues of the moment which I
                        mentioned earlier—Iran, Indochina, the Horn, Afghanistan—indications of
                        longer term trends? Do we respond to these issues not only with the sense of
                        urgency which is obviously called for but with a sense of historical despair
                        as well? Or are the positive developments more indicative of our era? Should
                        we continue on course? In short, is an optimistic or pessimistic view of
                        history justified? It seems to me that this issue underlies the emerging
                        foreign policy debate in the United States.</p>
                    <p>Without being Pollyannaish, this Administration is basically optimistic. We
                        recognize the future is ours only with effort. Continued American vigilance,
                        preparedness, and decisiveness are necessary to grasp the better future
                        before us. But an optimistic view of history and of America’s future lies at
                        the heart of this Administration’s foreign policy and of our China
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>I do not mean to downplay or belittle the seriousness of the current foreign
                        policy challenges. Important, indeed vital, issues are at stake. But in each
                        situation, we are developing responses appropriate to the challenges
                        involved. The United States will suffer occasional setbacks, but we will
                        continue to be able to offset our losses with gains elsewhere—such as those
                        that have occurred in recent years in our relations with India, Egypt,
                        Eastern Europe, Ghana, the Sudan, and East Asia.</p>
                    <p>What we emphatically reject are apocalyptic visions about the future ability
                        of the United States to pursue and defend our interests abroad. The
                        pessimism that one hears from many quarters conveys a sense of Armageddon
                        and of the need to rush to the barricade at every challenge without
                        forethought.</p>
                    <p>Today, we seek neither a world order based on a Pax Americana nor an order
                        based on a Soviet-American condominium. Neither order is possible or
                        just.</p>
                    <p>Rather, we are in the process of creating a diverse and stable community of
                        independent states. Working with our traditional allies—for we cannot do the
                        job alone—we are beginning to create a framework <pb n="537" facs="0578"
                            xml:id="pg_537"/>for wide-ranging international cooperation involving
                        the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and many of the emerging regional
                        powers such as Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, India, and
                        Indonesia. And with the establishment of full diplomatic relations with the
                        People’s Republic of China, we very significantly increase the scope of
                        international cooperation.</p>
                    <p>We wish, of course, to include the Soviet Union in that framework of
                        cooperation. Indeed, a fundamental choice the Soviet Union faces is whether
                        to become a responsible partner in the creation of a global system of
                        genuinely independent states or whether to exclude itself from global trends
                        and derive its security exclusively from its military might and its
                        domination of a few clients. We hope and encourage the Soviet Union to be
                        cooperative, but, whichever path the Soviet Union chooses, we will continue
                        our efforts to shape a framework for global cooperation based not on
                        domination but on respect for diversity.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that the world is changing under the influence of forces no
                        government can control. The world’s population is experiencing a political
                        awakening on a scale without precedent in its history. The global system is
                        undergoing a significant redistribution of political and economic power.</p>
                    <p>The record of the past 2 years suggests, however, that the United States need
                        not fear this change. To the contrary, the record shows that we can shape
                        this change to our benefit and attain security in a world of diversity.</p>
                    <p>Not only does the record of the past 2 years suggest realistic optimism is
                        warranted. Our own past and the quality of our people also encourage
                        confidence. For our national experience as a nation of diverse origins and
                        of change speaks to the emerging global condition. Not just our wealth, not
                        just our military might, but our history as a pluralistic people and our
                        commitment to the values of freedom and independence which now stir all of
                        mankind give us a naturally key role in shaping the trends of our time.</p>
                    <p>Given our assessment of history and the goals of the Administration, these
                        points should be made about our China policy.</p>
                    <p>• We see normalization as having long-term, historic significance. It
                        comprises part of our effort to consolidate and improve our relations with
                        all the emerging powers in the world. And none of these powers is more
                        important than China, with its nearly billion people and third largest
                        defense budget in the world.</p>
                    <p>• We did not normalize out of tactical or expedient considerations; rather we
                        recognized reality. The People’s Republic of China is going to play an
                        increasing role in world affairs, and it was important for us to have a
                        continuing, broadened, and structured relationship with this government.</p>
                    <pb n="538" facs="0579" xml:id="pg_538"/>
                    <p>• We recognize that the P.R.C. and we have different ideologies and economic
                        and political systems. We recognize that to transcend the differences and to
                        make our new relationship successful will require patience, wisdom, and
                        understanding. We harbor neither the hope nor the desire that through
                        extensive contacts with China we can remake that nation into the American
                        image.</p>
                    <p>• Indeed, we accept our differences. Normalization is an important part of
                        our global effort to create a stable community of diverse and independent
                        nations. As President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> stated
                        in his cable to Premier <persName corresp="#p_HG_2">Hua Guofeng</persName>
                        on January 1: “. . . the United States desires a world of diversity in which
                        each nation is free to make a distinctive contribution to . . . the manifold
                        aspirations . . . of mankind . . . we welcome the growing involvement of the
                        People’s Republic of China in world affairs.”<note n="18" xml:id="d108fn18"

                    <p>• We consider China as a key force for global peace simply by being China: an
                        independent and strong nation reaching for increased contact with the rest
                        of the world while remaining basically self-reliant and resistant of any
                        efforts by others to dominate it.</p>

                            peace.”<note n="19" xml:id="d108fn19">

                            January 2, 1979, pp. A–1, A–9.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The community of interest we share with China is particularly evident in
                        Asia, where we both desire peace, stability, and nations free of outside
                        domination.</p>
                    <p>East, Southeast, and South Asia is one of the most important regions of the
                        world today. The economies of the area are booming; the people are dynamic.
                        The United States has great economic and security interests around the rim
                        of Asia: in Japan, South Korea, all the Pacific islands down to the
                        Philippines, and in Southeast Asia as well.</p>
                    <p>To protect our interests, we retain a strong military presence in the region,
                        we maintain appropriate weapon sales throughout the region, and we are
                        prepared to act on our interests should the need arise.</p>
                    <p>Few actions will contribute more to the security and stability of our
                        important positions around the rim of Asia, however, than a constructive
                        involvement with China. As we improve our relations with Beijing, China will
                        also wish to keep us involved in the region and not, as in the past, seek to
                        drive us away.</p>
                    <pb n="539" facs="0580" xml:id="pg_539"/>
                    <p>For the first time in decades, we can enjoy simultaneously good relations
                        with both China and Japan. It is difficult to overstress the importance of
                        this fact. Normalization consolidates a favorable balance of power in the
                        Far East and enhances the security of our friends.</p>
                    <p>Now the Chinese are turning outward and extending their hand to the West. We
                        are prepared to respond less in confidence that in the future their hand
                        will remain extended than in the knowledge that without a reciprocal
                        gesture, their hand would certainly be withdrawn. And by developing bonds of
                        commerce and shared understanding, we reduce the chances of future
                        animosity.</p>
                    <p>That is why we have completed the process of normalization begun by President
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName>, President <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName>, and Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Normalization, therefore, is an act rooted in historical optimism and
                        political realism. This change in our China policy does not represent
                        retreat or abandonment of our previous positions; rather, it reflects our
                        determination to be globally engaged, to welcome diversity, and to shape our
                        future.</p>
                    <p>For a generation, we said “no” to the reality of East Asia. We refused to
                        recognize reality, we sought to isolate China, and we lived by myths—with
                        two wars and with incalculable cost to the region and to us. Now, we say
                        “yes” to reality. We are confident that as an Asian and Pacific power with a
                        positive relationship with Beijing, we will significantly contribute to the
                        peace and prosperity of the American people and of all peoples in the
                        region.</p>

                            I thought the delivery was relatively poor, but it got good reviews. At

                    <p>Tonight I want to examine in a broad sense the state of our American
                        Union—how we are building a new foundation for a peaceful and a prosperous
                        world.</p>
                    <p>Our children who will be born this year will come of age in the 21st century.
                        What kind of society, what kind of world are we building for them? Will we
                        ourselves be at peace? Will our children enjoy a better quality of life?
                        Will a strong and united America still be a force for freedom and prosperity
                        around the world?</p>
                    <p>Tonight, there is every sign that the state of our Union is sound.</p>
                    <p>Our economy offers greater prosperity for more of our people than ever
                        before. Real per capita income and real business profits have risen
                        substantially in the last 2 years. Farm exports are setting an all-time
                        record each year, and farm income last year, net farm income, was up more
                        than 25 percent.</p>
                    <p>Our liberties are secure. Our military defenses are strong and growing
                        stronger. And more importantly, tonight, America—our beloved country—is at
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>Our earliest national commitments, modified and reshaped by succeeding
                        generations, have served us well. But the problems that we face today are
                        different from those that confronted earlier generations of Americans. They
                        are more subtle, more complex, and more interrelated. At home, we are
                        recognizing ever more clearly that government alone cannot solve these
                        problems. And abroad, few of them can be solved by the United States alone.
                        But Americans as a united people, working with our allies and friends, have
                        never been afraid to face problems and to solve problems, either here or
                        abroad.</p>
                    <p>The challenge to us is to build a new and firmer foundation for the
                        future—for a sound economy, for a more effective government, for <pb n="541"
                            facs="0582" xml:id="pg_541"/>more political trust, and for a stable
                        peace, so that the America our children inherit will be even stronger and
                        even better than it is today.</p>
                    <p>We cannot resort to simplistic or extreme solutions which substitute myths
                        for common sense.</p>
                    <p>In our economy, it is a myth that we must choose endlessly between inflation
                        and recession. Together, we build the foundation for a strong economy, with
                        lower inflation, without contriving either a recession with its high
                        unemployment or unworkable, mandatory government controls.</p>
                    <p>In our government, it is a myth that we must choose between compassion and
                        competence. Together, we build the foundation for a government that
                        works—and works for people.</p>
                    <p>In our relations with our potential adversaries, it is a myth that we must
                        choose between confrontation and capitulation. Together, we build the
                        foundation for a stable world of both diversity and peace.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here is the portion of the address devoted to domestic policy.]</p>
                    <p>A strong economy and an effective government will restore confidence in
                        America. But the path of the future must be charted in peace. We must
                        continue to build a new and a firm foundation for a stable world
                        community.</p>
                    <p>We are building that new foundation from a position of national strength—the
                        strength of our own defenses, the strength of our friendships with other
                        nations, and of our oldest American ideals.</p>
                    <p>America’s military power is a major force for security and stability in the
                        world. We must maintain our strategic capability and continue the progress
                        of the last 2 years with our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Allies,
                        with whom we have increased our readiness, modernized our equipment, and
                        strengthened our defense forces in Europe. I urge you to support the strong
                        defense budget which I have proposed to the Congress.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d109fn3">In his January 22 message to the Congress transmitting
                            the administration’s <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1980 budget, the
                            President indicated that the defense budget “provides for growth in
                            outlays in real terms of 3% above the current year’s spending.” He noted
                            that the budget also “continues my policy of steady modernization of our
                            strategic forces and improved combat readiness of our tactical forces.”

                    <p>But our national security in this complicated age requires more than just
                        military might. In less than a lifetime, world population has more than
                        doubled, colonial empires have disappeared, and a hundred new nations have
                        been born. Mass communications, literacy, and migration to the world’s
                        cities have all awakened new yearnings for economic justice and human rights
                        among people everywhere.</p>
                    <pb n="542" facs="0583" xml:id="pg_542"/>
                    <p>This demand for justice and human rights is a wave of the future. In such a
                        world, the choice is not which super power will dominate the world. None can
                        and none will. The choice instead is between a world of anarchy and
                        destruction, or a world of cooperation and peace.</p>
                    <p>In such a world, we seek not to stifle inevitable change, but to influence
                        its course in helpful and constructive ways that enhance our values, our
                        national interests, and the cause of peace.</p>
                    <p>Towering over this volatile, changing world, like a thundercloud on a summer
                        day, looms the awesome power of nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>We will continue to help shape the forces of change, to anticipate emerging
                        problems of nuclear proliferation and conventional arms sales, and to use
                        our great strength and influence to settle international conflicts in other
                        parts of the world before they erupt and spread.</p>
                    <p>We have no desire to be the world’s policeman. But America does want to be
                        the world’s peacemaker.</p>
                    <p>We are building the foundation for truly global cooperation, not only with
                        Western and industrialized nations but with the developing countries as
                        well. Our ties with Japan and our European allies are stronger than ever,
                        and so are our friendly relations with the people of Latin America, Africa,
                        and the Western Pacific and Asia.</p>
                    <p>We’ve won new respect in this hemisphere with the Panama Canal treaties.
                        We’ve gained new trust with the developing world through our opposition to
                        racism, our commitment to human rights, and our support for majority rule in
                        Africa.</p>
                    <p>The multilateral trade negotiations are now reaching a successful conclusion,
                        and congressional approval is essential to the economic well-being of our
                        own country and of the world. This will be one of our top priorities in
                        1979.</p>
                    <p>We are entering a hopeful era in our relations with one-fourth of the world’s
                        people who live in China. The presence of Vice Premier <persName

                        inaugurate that new era.<note n="4" xml:id="d109fn4">See <ref

                        commitment to a prosperous, peaceful, and secure life for the people of
                        Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>I’m grateful that in the past year, as in the year before, no American has
                        died in combat anywhere in the world. And in Iran, Nicaragua, Cyprus,
                        Namibia, and Rhodesia, our country is working for peaceful solutions to
                        dangerous conflicts.</p>
                    <p>In the Middle East, under the most difficult circumstances, we have sought to
                        help ancient enemies lay aside deep-seated differences that have produced
                        four bitter wars in our lifetime.</p>
                    <pb n="543" facs="0584" xml:id="pg_543"/>
                    <p>Our firm commitment to Israel’s survival and security is rooted in our
                        deepest convictions and in our knowledge of the strategic importance to our
                        own Nation of a stable Middle East. To promote peace and reconciliation in
                        the region, we must retain the trust and the confidence both of Israel and
                        also of the Arab nations that are sincerely searching for peace.</p>
                    <p>I am determined, as President, to use the full, beneficial influence of our
                        country so that the precious opportunity for lasting peace between Israel
                        and Egypt will not be lost.</p>
                    <p>The new foundation of international cooperation that we seek excludes no
                        nation. Cooperation with the Soviet Union serves the cause of peace, for in
                        this nuclear age, world peace must include peace between the super
                        powers—and it must mean the control of nuclear arms.</p>
                    <p>Ten years ago, the United States and the Soviet Union made the historic
                        decision to open the strategic arms limitations talks, or <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. The purpose of <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, then as now, is not to gain a
                        unilateral advantage for either nation, but to protect the security of both
                        nations, to reverse the costly and dangerous momentum of the nuclear arms
                        race, to preserve a stable balance of nuclear forces, and to demonstrate to
                        a concerned world that we are determined to help preserve the peace.</p>
                    <p>The first <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement was concluded in
                        1972. And since then, during 6 years of negotiation by both Republican and
                        Democratic leaders, nearly all issues of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> II have been resolved. If the Soviet Union continues to
                        negotiate in good faith, a responsible <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> agreement will be reached.</p>
                    <p>It’s important that the American people understand the nature of the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> process.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II is not based on sentiment; it’s
                        based on self-interest—of the United States and of the Soviet Union. Both
                        nations share a powerful common interest in reducing the threat of a nuclear
                        war. I will sign no agreement which does not enhance our national
                        security.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II does not rely on trust; it will be
                        verifiable. We have very sophisticated, proven means, including our
                        satellites, to determine for ourselves whether or not the Soviet Union is
                        meeting its treaty obligations. I will sign no agreement which cannot be
                        verified.</p>
                    <p>The American nuclear deterrent will remain strong after <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. For example, just one of our
                        relatively invulnerable <hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_Poseidon_1">Poseidon</gloss>
                        </hi> submarines—comprising less than 2 percent of our total nuclear force
                        of submarines, aircraft, and land-based missiles—carries enough warheads to
                        destroy every large- and medium-sized city in the Soviet Union. Our
                        deterrent is overwhelming, and I will sign no agreement unless our deterrent
                        force will remain overwhelming.</p>
                    <p>A <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement, of course, cannot
                        substitute for wise diplomacy or a strong defense, nor will it end the
                        danger of nuclear war. But <pb n="544" facs="0585" xml:id="pg_544"/>it will
                        certainly reduce that danger. It will strengthen our efforts to ban nuclear
                        tests and to stop the spread of atomic weapons to other nations. And it can
                        begin the process of negotiating new agreements which will further limit
                        nuclear arms.</p>
                    <p>The path of arms control, backed by a strong defense—the path our Nation and
                        every President has walked for 30 years—can lead to a world of law and of
                        international negotiation and consultation in which all peoples might live
                        in peace. In this year, 1979, nothing is more important than that the
                        Congress and the people of the United States resolve to continue with me on
                        that path of nuclear arms control and world peace. This is paramount.</p>
                    <p>I’ve outlined some of the changes that have transformed the world and which
                        are continuing as we meet here tonight. But we, in America, need not fear
                        change. The values on which our Nation was founded—individual liberty,
                        self-determination, the potential for human fulfillment in freedom—all of
                        these endure. We find these democratic principles praised, even in books
                        smuggled out of totalitarian nations and on wallposters in lands which we
                        thought were closed to our influence. Our country has regained its special
                        place of leadership in the worldwide struggle for human rights. And that is
                        a commitment that we must keep at home, as well as abroad.</p>
                    <p>The civil rights revolution freed all Americans, black and white, but its
                        full promise still remains unrealized. I will continue to work with all my
                        strength for equal opportunity for all Americans—and for affirmative action
                        for those who carry the extra burden of past denial of equal
                        opportunity.</p>
                    <p>We remain committed to improving our labor laws to better protect the rights
                        of American workers. And our Nation must make it clear that the legal rights
                        of women as citizens are guaranteed under the laws of our land by ratifying
                        the equal rights amendment.</p>
                    <p>As long as I’m President, at home and around the world America’s examples and
                        America’s influence will be marshaled to advance the cause of human
                        rights.</p>
                    <p>To establish those values, two centuries ago a bold generation of Americans
                        risked their property, their position, and life itself. We are their heirs,
                        and they are sending us a message across the centuries. The words they made
                        so vivid are now growing faintly indistinct, because they are not heard
                        often enough. They are words like justice, equality, unity, truth,
                        sacrifice, liberty, faith, and love.</p>
                    <p>These words remind us that the duty of our generation of Americans is to
                        renew our Nation’s faith—not focused just against foreign threats but
                        against the threats of selfishness, cynicism, and apathy.</p>
                    <p>The new foundation I’ve discussed tonight can help us build a nation and a
                        world where every child is nurtured and can look to the fu<pb n="545"
                            facs="0586" xml:id="pg_545"/>ture with hope, where the resources now
                        wasted on war can be turned towards meeting human needs, where all people
                        have enough to eat, a decent home, and protection against disease.</p>
                    <p>It can help us build a nation and a world where all people are free to seek
                        the truth and to add to human understanding, so that all of us may live our
                        lives in peace.</p>
                    <p>Tonight, I ask you, the Members of the Congress, to join me in building that
                        new foundation—a better foundation—for our beloved country and our
                        world.</p>

                    <p>This week I am giving you two items for your weekly report: a frank and
                        personal midterm assessment; and several maps which speak for themselves by
                        graphically conveying what you and I recently discussed. I hope they are

                    <p>You have Cy’s analysis of what we have accomplished thus far in your
                        Administration as well as an outline of future priorities.<note n="2"

                        you know, I generally agree with his analysis of our longer-term priorities.
                        This brief note seeks to lay out, at the mid point of your Administration,
                        the major issues and questions which will dominate our foreign policy
                        concerns as you approach the 1980 election.</p>
                    <p>I believe there are four issues. First, what will be your principal foreign
                        policy success <hi rend="italic">in 1980</hi>? Second, how should we play
                        out the implementation of the Camp David accords? Third, what do we do to
                            <pb n="546" facs="0587" xml:id="pg_546"/>maintain the crucial and
                        delicate balance between ourselves, the Soviet Union and China? And fourth,
                        what can be done to our national security process to overcome a deep-seated
                        perception that we are in disarray—an image which gravely undermines the
                        very real and substantive successes of this Administration.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Achievements in 1980</p>
                    <p>Your intense work over the last two years on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss>, the Middle East and China is bearing fruit. We are about
                        to sign a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement, and with effort
                        and firmness we might have a Middle East treaty. The Deng visit will
                        dramatize a very real diplomatic accomplishment.<note n="3" xml:id="d110fn3"
                            >See <ref target="#d104fn3">footnote 3, Document 104</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>But the question as we approach 1980 is what do we do for an encore. The
                        achievement of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> summit will evolve
                        into a long, possibly bitter and potentially inconclusive ratification
                        debate. Legislative liaison experts now estimate we may not achieve Senate
                        ratification before Thanksgiving and possibly not before Christmas. While
                        ratification itself will be an achievement, it is hard to believe it will
                        provide much political momentum for the campaign of 1980, especially if the
                        Soviets in the meantime again do something that generates further public
                        concerns about their motives and actions.</p>
                    <p>The problems of the Middle East are likely to drag on in one form or another.
                        This is addressed in detail below. It is also true that we are likely to
                        continue to have turmoil in Iran with wider international repercussions.</p>
                    <p>We have surveyed the possible achievements which we might seek that could
                        come to fruition in 1980. Success in Southern Africa, if it is possible,
                        will not have a great public impact. <gloss target="#t_CTB_1">CTB</gloss> is
                        likely to produce a divisive debate in Congress. Conventional Arms Transfer
                        Limitation will be a positive step but will not command enormous public
                        attention. The same may be said for an Indian Ocean agreement or the
                        establishment of some new rules regarding the proliferation of nuclear
                        capabilities as the result of <gloss target="#t_INFCE_1">INFCE</gloss>.<note
                            n="4" xml:id="d110fn4">See <ref target="#d56fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                56</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The only measure apart from those indicated below that might have a broad
                        impact is the achievement of a first step <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1"
                            >MBFR</gloss> agreement focusing primarily if not exclusively on
                        U.S.-Soviet reductions in Central Europe. Such an agreement could well be
                        signed at a Summit of the more than a dozen nations which participate in
                            <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss>. It could be a significant
                        political event, indicative of improving East-West relations. We could seek
                        to time such an initial agreement for the spring of 1980, shortly before the
                        Democratic Convention.</p>
                    <pb n="547" facs="0588" xml:id="pg_547"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Middle East</p>
                    <p>Better still would be a significant breakthrough to peace in the Middle East.
                        It seems clear that in any case fulfillment of Camp David will be an
                        essential yardstick to measure the success of your Presidency. This will
                        require additional direct and deep involvement on your part. I am still
                        convinced that genuine progress is achievable.</p>
                    <p>However, we must recognize that the American Jewish community harbors deep
                        suspicion of this Administration. This can only be overcome by a successful
                        conclusion to the Israeli-Egyptian negotiations. Moreover, suspicion is
                        easily rekindled—witness the resurgence of Jewish concern after the euphoria
                        of Camp David.</p>
                    <p>In this situation I believe our strategy should be to make a maximum effort
                        in the near future to conclude a treaty, to be followed by negotiations
                        regarding self-government in the West Bank and Gaza. Once the latter are
                        underway, we would be able to lower the profile of our involvement in Middle
                        East matters until after the 1980 election. This maximum effort should be
                        made between now and late spring—to be followed by a gradual easing off on
                        our part.</p>
                    <p>Another way perhaps of dealing with the linkage issue—in the event that it
                        proves impossible to obtain a formal Israeli commitment to elections on the
                        West Bank—might be an understanding between the Israelis and the Egyptians
                        or between the Israelis and ourselves (with us conveying it to the
                        Egyptians) that Israel will now undertake a series of unilateral steps
                        designed to set in motion a political process on the West Bank/Gaza,
                        pointing toward eventual self-government. This could involve release of some
                        prisoners, fewer restrictions on political activity, the initiation of
                        discussions on the subject of elections and the scope of authority for the
                        self-government, self-restraint on settlements, etc. The point would be to
                        substitute tangible Israeli actions for the formal commitment that the
                        Israelis may be unwilling to make publicly (I will be exploring these and
                        other ideas with Cy <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> and Bill
                        Quandt, and the above is merely suggestive).</p>
                    <p>In any case, we have little time left for endless litigation of the issue,
                        and within the next two weeks or so some basic strategic decisions
                        concerning the rest of this year and next year ought to be made.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">US-<gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>-China</p>
                    <p>Normalization with China obviously carries with it the risk of Soviet
                        over-reaction and miscalculations in both Peking and Moscow. We are now
                        directly in the middle of a very delicate balancing act—one which is
                        complicated by the fact that both Brezhnev and <persName corresp="#p_DX_1"
                            >Deng</persName> are old and we could, even in the next few years, see
                        significant governmental changes in both countries.</p>
                    <pb n="548" facs="0589" xml:id="pg_548"/>
                    <p>There is also a ripple effect. The Germans, for example, are already nervous
                        that the Soviet response to our playing “the China card” will result in the
                        Russians playing “the German card.” By this they are evidently concerned
                        that pressure could be brought on Berlin or that some other aspect of
                        Soviet-West German relations could be adversely affected.</p>
                    <p>Thus, it is extremely important for allied solidarity as well as global
                        stability for this three-cornered relationship to be handled with the utmost
                        care. From a political standpoint it is important to maintain momentum with
                        both Peking and Moscow. I believe this means that you should plan on
                        emerging from both the Deng visit and the Brezhnev visit<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d110fn5">During a December 7, 1978, question-and-answer session
                            at a breakfast with members of the White House Correspondents
                            Association, the President indicated that he would like to host Brezhnev
                            in Washington for 4–5 days to discuss “a broad range of agenda items.”
                                (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                                    >Carter</persName>, 1978,</hi> Book I, p. 2180) Responding to
                            reporters’ questions in Plains, Georgia, on December 25, the President
                            suggested that it was unlikely that the meeting would take place in
                            January, but adding: “We would be ready in January if the Soviets are.”
                            (Ibid., p. 2287)</note> with concrete plans to visit both China and the
                        Soviet Union before the 1980 election. (You should make some tentative
                        scheduling decisions on this even before you meet with <persName
                            corresp="#p_DX_1">Deng</persName>.)</p>
                    <p>Such summits in Peking and Moscow will not only enhance your own prestige but
                        serve as a focus for structuring our relations with both China and the
                        Soviet Union over the next 18 months. They will provide both reassurance of
                        a continuing relationship with both countries and positive incentives for
                        both to maintain a measure of restraint in their mutual relations.</p>
                    <p>My second recommendation is that you take more direct command of our
                        relationship with the Soviet Union. You should insist on tight personal
                        control of all actions affecting our relationship with the Soviet Union. You
                        have taken this approach in regard to the Middle East and China with
                        significant success. There is a potential for great disarray, given the
                        different ideological views in your Administration. We cannot afford this
                        disarray any longer, but it is likely to intensify in the absence of better
                        discipline.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Process</p>
                    <p>This leads me to my final concern. Substantively, we are doing extremely
                        well. You have dispelled the popular impression that you are not skilled in
                        foreign policy. You have made real progress on a number of key issues, and
                        today the U.S. has better relations with the more important countries in the
                        world than <hi rend="italic">at any point</hi> since 1945.</p>
                    <p>But as an Administration, we have not dispelled the notion that we are
                        amateurish and disorganized and that our policies are uncertain <pb n="549"
                            facs="0590" xml:id="pg_549"/>and irresolute. (The latest issue of <hi

                            policy successes and limitations during the second year of his
                            administration.</note> makes a very strong case to that effect, and that
                        is becoming the conventional wisdom.) This is the direct result not of our
                        policies but of the way in which almost anyone in the bureaucracy feels free
                        to talk to the press, discuss and distort the most intimate decision-making
                        processes, and generally promote themselves or their personal policy
                        preferences. It is extremely destructive, not only of our foreign policy but
                        of political support for this Administration. I am afraid I see no remedy to
                        this problem short of a significant shake-up, particularly in the State
                        Department. There are faults here in The White House, in the <gloss

                        have a discussion with any journalist in this city without gaining the very
                        clear impression that the leaks and misinformation coming out of the State
                        Department are of unprecedented proportions.</p>
                    <p>I am prepared to direct my staff to have no conversations with the press

                        destructive, and I do think that you should consult some of your close
                        political advisers (Ham, Jody,<note n="10" xml:id="d110fn10">

                        reassert more effective discipline. I do not wish to offer advice along
                        these lines because it could be misconstrued as being self-serving.</p>
                    <p>In sum, if our foreign policy efforts are not only to be successful but be
                        perceived as such so as to contribute to your political strength in 1980, it
                        is necessary to focus on those few issues which will come to fruition at
                        that time. And it is important that we do so with a genuine sense of
                        cohesion and loyalty. I want you to know that I myself and my staff will do
                        our utmost to refrain from contributing to public disarray. A similar
                        commitment elsewhere in the government should be required as well.</p>

                    <p>I believe these maps, albeit in a simplified fashion, capture the significant
                        political changes that have occurred over the past two and a half decades.
                        Here are a few observations:</p>
                    <p>1. The most <hi rend="italic">far-reaching</hi> changes have taken place in
                            <hi rend="italic">Asia</hi>—the Far East, Southeast Asia and South
                        Asia—and the most important of these has been the <hi rend="italic">
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss>
                        </hi>. The alignment of India has also shifted during this period and it
                        could be argued that India should now be considered trending toward the West
                        (light blue) rather than non-aligned (white). The next year—and the fate of
                            <persName corresp="#p_GI_1">Indira Gandhi</persName> and the Janata
                            Party—<pb n="551" facs="0592" xml:id="pg_551"/>should answer this
                        question. From a policy standpoint, one point is obvious—the <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> Administration has recognized the
                        reality of these new alignments in Asia and has fashioned its policy
                        accordingly. U.S. policy is now joined with the present and future, not the
                        past.</p>
                    <p>2. In terms of <hi rend="italic">numbers</hi>, the <hi rend="italic"
                            >greatest</hi> change has occurred in <hi rend="italic">Africa</hi>.
                        Taking into account the explosion of new nations, there have been 23
                        alignments or realignments over the past 25 years. The end to this change is
                        not in sight.</p>
                    <p>3. The greatest <hi rend="italic">potential</hi> area of change is in the
                            “<hi rend="italic">arc of instability</hi>.” You will note a question
                        mark by Iran on the 1979 map, as well as its white coloration. That same
                        question mark could be applied to the region.</p>
                    <p>4. The area of <hi rend="italic">least</hi> change—with the obvious exception
                        of Europe—has been the <hi rend="italic">Western hemisphere</hi>, although
                        to our south there has been a slight trend toward less alignment with the
                        U.S. Given the history of the region—and the need to set U.S.-Latin
                        relations on a more mature basis for the future—this is probably a <hi
                            rend="italic">positive</hi> development (up to a point).</p>
                    <p>5. With respect to <hi rend="italic">worldwide trends</hi>, the United States
                        has reason to be optimistic; the Soviets less so. Again, the changing
                        political alignment of the <gloss target="#t_PRC_1">PRC</gloss> is largely
                        responsible for this. In addition, our region of the world is relatively
                        stable; the Soviet Union’s is not. The next few years, however, will be
                        critical ones. How the conflicts in the Middle East, the “arc of
                        instability,” and Southern Africa are resolved will go a long way toward
                        determining the alignments of the future.</p>
                    <p>As you have often mentioned, the world today is undergoing tremendous
                        change—demographic, social, economic and political. The attached maps
                        reflect the <hi rend="italic">surface manifestations</hi> of these changes.
                        Far more interesting would be a map that depicted the <hi rend="italic"
                            >undercurrents</hi> of change. In lieu of such a map, studies such as
                        the one you recently requested on the international implications of Islamic
                        fundamentalism will be essential.<note n="12" xml:id="d110fn12">Not

                            president of the United States.” (<hi rend="italic">White House

                    <p>I have always been proud that I attended Georgia Tech, and I’ve always been
                        grateful for what I learned here.</p>
                    <p>I have attended as a full-time student four different colleges in my life.
                        Georgia Tech is by far the most difficult—[<hi rend="italic"
                        >laughter</hi>]—and a number of years ago I decided that my being elected
                        President was the only way that I would ever have a chance to get a degree
                        from Georgia Tech. [<hi rend="italic">Laughter</hi>] This has made it
                        worthwhile. [<hi rend="italic">Laughter</hi>]</p>
                    <p>I remember when I first came to Tech, the entire world was at war. Our Nation
                        was under attack on two fronts and was desperately gearing up for a total
                        war effort that we had not known since we fought each other in the
                        1860’s.</p>
                    <p>In 1942, 1943, it was not yet a time for victories for the United States nor
                        for our allies, and many people feared that Western democracies might be
                        overwhelmed. We now face a very different world from the world in which I
                        came of age. The old empires are gone, and the maps are covered with new and
                        developing nations with names that we had then never heard.</p>
                    <p>But one thing has not changed as much as I had hoped. It’s still a world of
                        danger, a world in which democracy and freedom are still challenged, a world
                        in which peace must be rewon day by day. Too many people still lack the
                        simplest necessities of life, and too many are deprived of the most basic
                        human rights. As the events of recent days</p>

                    <p>have shown, peace remains a fragile thing, vulnerable to assaults from all
                        sides.</p>
                    <p>Disturbances in Iran, the Western Indian Ocean, and Southeast Asia, are a
                        challenge to our determination and our leadership. They underscore the
                        importance of strength in our national defenses, wisdom in our diplomacy,
                        and steadfastness in the pursuit of arms control and peace.</p>
                    <p>I want to speak to you today about America’s role and America’s purpose in
                        this world of change and turbulence.</p>
                    <p>Ever since the end of the Second World War, the United States has been the
                        leader in moving our world closer to a stable peace and genuine security. We
                        have the world’s strongest economy; we have the world’s strongest military
                        forces; and we share burdens of mutual defense with friends abroad whose
                        security and prosperity are as vital to us as to themselves.</p>
                    <p>With our strong allies, we have succeeded in preventing a global war for more
                        than one-third of a century—the longest period of general peace in modern
                        times. And as President of the United States, I am determined to keep our
                        Nation at peace.</p>
                    <p>We help to sustain a world trading and monetary system that has brought
                        greater prosperity to more of the world’s people than ever before in
                        history. We are working to resolve conflicts among other nations so that
                        each can develop its own future in independence and peace. And we’ve helped
                        to maintain the conditions in which more than 100 new nations have come into
                        being, and in which human hope—and its fulfillment—has taken a revolutionary
                        leap forward.</p>
                    <p>In short, we in the United States provide the bedrock of global security and
                        economic advance in a world of unprecedented change and conflict.</p>
                    <p>In such a world America has four fundamental security responsibilities: to
                        provide for our own Nation’s strength and safety; to stand by our allies and
                        our friends; to support national independence and integrity of other
                        nations; and to work diligently for peace.</p>
                    <p>We do not oppose change. Many of the political currents sweeping the world
                        express a desire that we share—the desire for a world in which the
                        legitimate aspirations of nations and individuals have a greater chance for
                        fulfillment.</p>
                    <p>The United States cannot control events within other nations. A few years
                        ago, we tried this and we failed. But we recognized as inevitable that the
                        uncertainty and the turmoil that come with change can have its darker side
                        as well. We saw this in a senseless act of violence last week in
                        Afghanistan, when a brave and good man—Ambassador <pb n="554" facs="0595"

                    <p>We also see the darker side of change when countries in turbulence provide
                        opportunities for exploitation by outsiders who seek not to advance human

                                Revolution, January 1977–November 1979</ref>.</note> It’s been our
                        hope that Iran could modernize without deep internal conflicts, and we
                        sought to encourage that effort by supporting its government, by urging
                        internal change toward progress and democracy, and by helping to provide a
                        background of regional stability.</p>
                    <p>The revolution in Iran is a product of deep social, political, religious, and
                        economic factors growing out of the history of Iran itself. Those who argue
                        that the United States should or could intervene directly to thwart these
                        events are wrong about the realities of Iran. So, too, are those who spout
                        propaganda that protecting our own citizens is tantamount to direct
                        intervention.</p>
                    <p>We have not and we will not intervene in Iran, yet the future of Iran
                        continues to be of deep concern to us and to our friends and allies. It’s an
                        important nation in a critical part of the world, an immediate neighbor of
                        the Soviet Union, a major oil producer that also sits beside the principal
                        artery for most of the world’s trade in oil. And it is still a significant
                        potential force for stability and progress in the region.</p>
                    <p>Iran is a proud nation with a long history—more than 2,000 years—of struggle
                        to establish and to guarantee its own freedom. The independence of Iran is
                        also in our own vital interest and in the interest of our closest allies—and
                        we will support the independence of Iran.</p>
                    <p>Out of today’s turmoil, it is our hope that these troubled people will create
                        a stable government which can meet the needs of the Iranian people and which
                        can enable that great nation not only to remain independent but to regain
                        its internal strength and balance.</p>
                    <pb n="555" facs="0596" xml:id="pg_555"/>
                    <p>We are prepared to support that effort as appropriate and to work with the
                        Iranian Government and the people as a nation which shares common interests
                        and common aspirations with us.</p>
                    <p>But just as we respect Iran’s independence and integrity, other nations must
                        do so as well. If others interfere, directly or indirectly, they are on
                        notice that this will have serious consequences and will affect our broader
                        relationships with them.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, we are intensifying our efforts to promote stability
                        throughout the Middle East so that the security and the independence of the
                        nations of that part of the world will be maintained.</p>
                    <p>At my direction, the Secretary of Defense recently carried out comprehensive
                        consultations in Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, concerning the
                        security of that region.<note n="5" xml:id="d111fn5">Documentation on

                        importance for their region for these talks to succeed.</p>
                    <p>For us in the United States, any crisis in the Middle East has the most
                        immediate and serious consequences. But we are also deeply concerned by what
                        is happening now in Southeast Asia. The same principles of American policy
                        apply: We support the independence and integrity of the regional nations; we
                        will stand by our friends; and we will continue as a nation to work for
                        peace.</p>

                        the stability of one of the world’s most important and promising
                        regions—Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>We have opposed both military actions. Let me outline very briefly the
                        principles that govern our conduct.</p>
                    <p>First, we will not get involved in conflict between Asian Communist nations.
                        Our national interests are not directly threatened, although we are
                        concerned, of course, at the wider implications of what might happen in the
                        future and what has been happening in the past.</p>
                    <p>We are using whatever diplomatic and political means are available to
                        encourage restraint on all parties and to seek to prevent a wider war. While
                        our influence is limited, because our involvement is limited, we remain the
                        one great power in all the world which can have direct and frank discussions
                        with all the parties concerned. For this reason, we have a useful and
                        important role to play in the restoration of stability. We will continue our
                        efforts, both directly with the countries involved and through the United
                        Nations, to secure an end to the fighting in the region, to bring about a
                        withdrawal of Vietnam forces from Cambodia, and of Chinese forces from
                        Vietnam, and to gain the restoration of the independence and integrity of
                        all nations involved.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, we are continuing to express our deep concern that this
                        conflict may widen still further—with unforeseen and grave consequences for
                        nations in the region and also beyond.</p>
                    <p>In any event, the United States is fully prepared to protect the vital
                        interests of our people wherever they may be challenged. We are in close
                        consultation with our friends and allies in the region, especially the
                        members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the <gloss
                            target="#t_ASEAN_1">ASEAN</gloss> nations. Their continued stability and
                        prosperity are of great importance to us.</p>
                    <p>The normalization of relations between the United States and the People’s
                        Republic of China is already an accomplished fact and will not be reversed.
                        This was the simple, long overdue recognition of the reality of the
                        government in Peking.</p>
                    <p>In the last few days, we’ve consulted directly with leaders around the
                        world—and with our own congressional leaders, as well—about events both in
                        the Middle East and Southeast Asia. The responsibilities that we face are
                        serious, and they are shared by the administration and the Congress, by our
                        Nation, and our allies—and our common understanding and our adherence to a
                        common cause are vital.</p>
                    <p>All of us know that the internal affairs of Iran or combat even among
                        Communist nations are of concern to us. Many nations are trou<pb n="557"
                            facs="0598" xml:id="pg_557"/>bled, even threatened by the turmoil in
                        Southeast Asia and in the Middle East. To stand by our friends and to help
                        meet their security needs in these difficult times, I will consult with the
                        Congress to determine what additional military assistance will be required.
                        This added measure of support is crucial for stability throughout the Indian
                        Ocean area.</p>
                    <p>And let me repeat, in the Middle East, in Southeast Asia, and elsewhere in
                        the world, we will stand by our friends. We will honor our commitments. And
                        we will protect the vital interests of the United States, and you can depend
                        on it.</p>
                    <p>As we face this immediate series of crises, we also look constantly to the
                        broader needs of security. If we are to meet our responsibilities, we must
                        continue to maintain the military forces we need for our defense and to
                        contribute to the defense of our allies.</p>
                    <p>This year, I have proposed a substantial real increase in the defense
                            budget.<note n="9" xml:id="d111fn9">See <ref target="#d109fn3">footnote
                                3, Document 109</ref>.</note> The events of recent weeks underscore
                        the responsibility of the Congress to appropriate these funds in full. There
                        must be no doubt that the people of the United States are fully prepared to
                        meet our commitments and to back up those commitments with military
                        strength.</p>
                    <p>Turmoil and crisis also underscore the vital needs to work wherever possible
                        to stabilize and to reduce competition in strategic nuclear weapons. This
                        effort has the same ultimate goals as does our strong defense—the goals of
                        security, stability, and peace. In pursuit of these goals, our Nation faces
                        no more important task this year than the successful conclusion of a
                        strategic arms limitation agreement.</p>
                    <p>Just as we work to support national independence and to aid our friends and
                        allies in times of trial, we must work to regulate nuclear arms capable of
                        threatening life throughout this planet. For a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> agreement is a fundamental element of strategic and
                        political stability in a turbulent world—stability which can provide the
                        necessary political basis for us to contain the kinds of crises that we face
                        today, and to prevent their growing into a terrible nuclear
                        confrontation.</p>
                    <p>After more than 6 years of negotiations—conducted by three different
                        Presidents—agreement has now been reached on most of the major components of
                        a sound and verifiable <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II treaty.</p>
                    <p>The emerging agreement will establish for the first time equal numbers of
                        strategic arms for both sides. It will thus reverse the Soviet’s numerical
                        advantage which was temporarily established in the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> I treaty of 1972, when they had about a 40-percent
                        built-in negotiated advantage.</p>
                    <pb n="558" facs="0599" xml:id="pg_558"/>
                    <p>To reach these new levels, the Soviets will be required to reduce their
                        overall number of strategic arms. Over 250 Soviet missiles or bombers—about
                        10 percent of their strategic forces—will have to be destroyed or
                        dismantled. At the same time, because we are now well below the agreed
                        ceiling, we could substantially increase our own operational strategic
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II agreement will also provide
                        negotiated limits on building new types of weapons and limits on the
                        improvement of existing ones—the so-called qualitative arms race can be
                        controlled.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II will limit the size of land-based
                        missiles and the number of warheads that can be placed on them. Without
                        these limits, the Soviets could vastly increase the number of warheads on
                        their large land-based missiles—with grave implications to the strategic
                        balance. <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II will therefore contribute
                        to our ability to deal with the growing vulnerability of our land-based
                        missiles. Without it, the Soviet Union could continue to increase the number
                        of their warheads, tending to nullify our effort to protect our
                        missiles.</p>
                    <p>The agreement will also permit us and our allies to pursue all the defense
                        programs that we believe might eventually be needed—the <gloss
                            target="#t_MX_1">M–X</gloss> missile; the Trident submarine and its
                        missiles; air, ground, and sea-launched cruise missiles; cruise missile
                        carrier aircraft; and a new penetrating bomber. These would be
                        permitted.</p>
                    <p>Thus <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II would allow our own prudent
                        programs to move ahead and also will place important limits on what the
                        Soviets might otherwise do. And this <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        II agreement will be a basis for further negotiations for additional
                        substantial cuts in the level of nuclear armaments.</p>
                    <p>Without the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II agreement, the Soviet
                        Union could have nearly one-third more strategic forces by 1985 than with
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. We would, of necessity, as a
                        nation, match such a buildup. The costs would be enormous, the risks
                        self-evident. And both nations would wind up less secure.</p>
                    <p>The stakes in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> are too high to rely on
                        trust. Any <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II treaty that I sign will
                        be adequately verifiable, using our own independent means of guaranteeing
                        Soviet compliance with terms of the agreement.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II will specifically forbid any
                        interference that would impede our ability to verify compliance with the
                        treaty. Any effort on the part of the Soviet Union to interfere with our
                        verification activities would be a detectable violation of the agreement
                        itself, and an early signal of any possible cheating.</p>
                    <p>Finally, let me put this agreement in the context of our overall relations
                        with the Soviet Union and the turbulence that exists in many parts of the
                        world. The question is not whether <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        can be divorced from <pb n="559" facs="0600" xml:id="pg_559"/>this
                        complicated context. It cannot. As I have often said, our relationship with
                        the Soviet Union is a mixture of cooperation and competition. And as
                        President of the United States, I have no more difficult and delicate task
                        than to balance these two. I cannot and I will not let the pressures of
                        inevitable competition overwhelm possibilities for cooperation, any more
                        than I will let cooperation blind us to the realities of competition, which
                        we are fully prepared to meet.</p>
                    <p>Because this carefully negotiated and responsible arms control agreement will
                        make the world safer and more secure, it is in our national interest to
                        pursue it, even as we continue competition with the Soviet Union elsewhere
                        in the world. Therefore, I will seek both to conclude this new <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement and to respond to any Soviet
                        behavior which adversely affects our interests.</p>
                    <p>To reject <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II would mean that the
                        inevitable competition in strategic nuclear arms would grow even more
                        dangerous. Each crisis, each confrontation, each point of friction—as
                        serious as it may be in its own right—would take on an added measure of
                        significance and an added dimension of danger. For it would occur in an
                        atmosphere of unbridled strategic competition and deteriorating strategic
                        stability. It is precisely because we have fundamental differences with the
                        Soviet Union that we are determined to bring this dangerous dimension of our
                        military competition under control.</p>
                    <p>In today’s world, it is vital to match the pursuit of ideals with the
                        responsible use of force and of power. The United States is a source of
                        both, ideals and power. Our ideals have inspired the world for more than two
                        centuries; and for three generations, since World War II, our power has
                        helped other nations to realize their own ideals.</p>
                    <p>The determination and strength of purpose of the American people are crucial
                        for stability in a turbulent world. If we stand together in maintaining a
                        steady course, America can protect its principles and interests and also be
                        a force for peace.</p>
                    <p>Americans have always accepted the challenge of leadership. And I am
                        confident that we will do so now.</p>
                    <p>Thank you very much.</p>

                        competition would reduce that margin. Allowing any nation to gain military
                        advantage over the United States would be equally dangerous.</p>
                    <p>We must not—and we will not—let either happen. This is the determination of
                        the <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> Administration. This is
                        the view of the vast majority of the American people—who overwhelmingly
                        support both an arms control agreement and a strong national defense. And I
                        am confident that Congress shares this view as it prepares to consider both
                        the strategic arms limitation treaty and our proposed defense programs.</p>
                    <p>There are some Americans, however, who fear that we are not strong enough as
                        a nation to move ahead with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. That
                        view—of the current military balance and of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss>—is wrong, and it can lead us in the wrong direction. It
                        not only underestimates America’s overwhelming nonmilitary advantages, it
                        seriously misjudges both our relative military strength and the effect of a
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement.</p>
                    <p>Our military position today is secure, and we are taking steps to assure that
                        it remains secure. And a sound <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        agreement will make us stronger as a nation because it will contribute to
                        that security.</p>
                    <pb n="561" facs="0602" xml:id="pg_561"/>
                    <p>Let me make that point again. The <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        agreement we hope to present to the American people is not a gift to the
                        Soviets; it is an agreement which serves the security interests of our
                        nation and of the world. It does not weaken us; it strengthens us.</p>
                    <p>We have watched carefully the steady growth of Soviet military power in
                        recent years. In some areas, the Soviets are ahead of us; in others, we are
                        ahead of them. What matters for us is not whether the two forces are
                        identical, but whether they are in an overall balance—for that is the basis
                        of security today.</p>
                    <p>For example, the Soviets have always had a larger land army. But we do not
                        need to match them man-for-man because of the strength of our more numerous
                        allies. The Soviet Union has always had more tanks. But we have three times
                        as many antitank weapons in Western Europe as there are Soviet tanks in
                        Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>The critical question is not whether we match the forces the Soviets have
                        built to meet their own security needs but whether we meet U.S. and allied
                        security needs. Without question, our forces meet those needs.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Strategic Advantages</p>
                    <p>To begin with, the United States has certain strategic advantages.</p>
                    <p>• We have friendly neighbors on our borders. The Soviet Union has far longer
                        and far more vulnerable borders.</p>
                    <p>• We have only one major adversary. The Soviets face two. Fully 25% of its
                        combat forces are deployed on the Soviet-Chinese border.</p>
                    <p>• We have easy access to the sea. The Soviets are restricted by narrow
                        straits, by a long and icy winter, and by other natural barriers.</p>
                    <p>Our military capabilities today are enormous and growing stronger. And our
                        allies and friends significantly increase our overall strength.</p>
                    <p>Nor are we standing still. Because of steady growth in Soviet defense
                        spending and capabilities over the past decade—particularly in central
                        Europe—we have had to reverse the pattern of shrinking American defense
                        efforts. We and our allies committed ourselves last year to increasing
                        individual defense expenditures.<note n="3" xml:id="d112fn3">The <gloss

                    <p>We must continue to protect our own and our allies’ interests. We are
                        strengthening our forces in Europe. We are improving our ability to speed
                        additional ground and air forces in the event of a crisis. And our European
                        allies, who provide most of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s combat
                        forces, are steadily improving their forces’ readiness and
                        effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>But it is the awesome power of our nuclear weapons that I want to emphasize
                        this afternoon.</p>
                    <p>Many of you here today remember the shuddering reality of our first atomic
                        bomb. Today, the United States has over 20,000 nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>• Each warhead on one of our <gloss target="#t_Poseidon_1">Poseidon</gloss>
                        missiles is two times more destructive than the atomic bombs dropped on
                        Hiroshima and Nagasaki. One <gloss target="#t_Poseidon_1">Poseidon</gloss>
                        submarine carries more than 140 warheads. Each <gloss target="#t_Poseidon_1"
                            >Poseidon</gloss> can deliver more destructive force than all the
                        bombs—nuclear and conventional—that were dropped during World War II. We
                        have 31 of these <gloss target="#t_Poseidon_1">Poseidon</gloss>
                        submarines.</p>
                    <p>• More than half of our 1,000 Minuteman missiles are equipped with multiple
                        independently-targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV’s)—which enable one rocket
                        to carry a number of warheads and thus strike at several different targets.
                        Each of the Minuteman warheads carries eight times the force of the first
                        atomic bomb. And soon we will double that destructive power.</p>
                    <p>We have 348 heavy bombers which can carry 2,000 megatons of total power. Let
                        me illustrate what that means. If every car of a train that extended from
                        Minneapolis to Winona<note n="5" xml:id="d112fn5">Approximately 100
                            miles.</note> were filled with TNT and blown up, that would be one
                        megaton.</p>
                    <p>I cite these facts to give you a sense of the enormous scale—and the great
                        diversity—of America’s nuclear strength.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets, of course, also have a large arsenal. But the factor that keeps
                        us at peace is not simply what each of us has; it is whether there is any
                        possibility that a nuclear attack on us or our allies would not mean massive
                        destruction for the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Let me take the worst case. It is possible that, in the early to mid-1980’s,
                        the Soviets—with a surprise attack—could destroy most of our land-based
                        missiles while keeping a large number of their missiles in reserve. In doing
                        so, they also must consider the grim possibility that we would have already
                        launched our missiles before theirs arrived. The possibility, even
                        theoretical, that our missiles would be vulnerable is something we are
                        working very hard to avoid.</p>
                    <p>But even if our land-based missiles were vulnerable to a surprise attack, we
                        could still totally destroy the Soviet Union as a viable society <pb n="563"
                            facs="0604" xml:id="pg_563"/>with the rest of our nuclear arsenal. No
                        sane leader could expect to gain an advantage from launching such a suicidal
                        attack.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Modernization and Restructuring</p>
                    <p>To assure that our strategic forces will be a convincing deterrent in the
                        future, we are carrying out the most extensive modernization and
                        restructuring of our nuclear forces in over a decade.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> we have put three-quarters of our strategic
                        warheads in our largely invulnerable submarines and mobile bombers;
                        three-quarters of the Soviet Union’s warheads are on more vulnerable fixed
                        land-based missiles.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Second,</hi> we are adding to the capabilities of our
                        strategic bombers. Our <gloss target="#t_B52_1">B–52</gloss> force is being
                        equipped with long-range cruise missiles. That force eclipses Soviet air
                        defense expenditures. These missiles will enable our <gloss
                            target="#t_B52_1">B–52</gloss>’s to remain outside Soviet air defenses
                        and still strike significant Soviet targets with extraordinary accuracy.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Third,</hi> we are placing more powerful, sophisticated
                        missiles in our existing submarines. We are about to launch our new,
                        longer-range Trident submarine; and we are developing a still more powerful
                        and accurate missile for these Trident submarines.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Fourth,</hi> we are substantially improving our land-based
                        missile force. Our Minuteman III’s will be considerably more accurate. We
                        are accelerating development of a new and much larger land-based missile
                        called the <gloss target="#t_MX_1">M–X</gloss>. And we are carefully
                        analyzing the alternatives available for making our intercontinental
                        ballistic missiles (<gloss target="#t_ICBM_1">ICBM</gloss>’s) less
                        vulnerable. The <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement now being
                        considered will not constrain a single one of these alternatives. Indeed, it
                        will help make these alternatives feasible and safe.</p>
                    <p>We will continue to maintain a convincing deterrent with a nuclear weapons
                        force. But in a world of nuclear weapons, more is not necessarily better. We
                        are not more secure today because we and the Soviets have tens of thousands
                        of warheads rather than thousands.</p>
                    <p>For the stark reality is that neither of us can win an all-out arms race. It
                        is a futile search for a temporary advantage. We will match what they do,
                        and they will do the same, in a spiral of ever-increasing risk and cost.</p>
                    <p>Thus the power we share with the Soviet Union carries this imperative for our
                        security: We must slow, and ultimately reverse, this dangerous and
                        burdensome competition. That is an imperative recognized for nearly three
                        decades. Every President since the beginning of the nuclear era—and both
                        major political parties—have understood that security depends on both a
                        sound defense and sound arms control.</p>

                        increase the number of their missiles by several hundred each year.<note
                            n="8" xml:id="d112fn8">See <ref target="#d52">Document 52</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>For the past 6 years, three Presidents of both parties have been negotiating
                        the next step in arms control—the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II
                        agreement. The negotiations have been intense. We have proceeded carefully
                        and deliberately. And we are near agreement.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">What <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Will
                        Accomplish</p>
                    <p>Let me explain what this agreement will accomplish.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> it will establish equal limits on the number
                        of missiles and bombers capable of delivering nuclear weapons to the other
                        side. The first <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement in 1972
                        froze the number of strategic missiles, leaving the Soviets with a numerical
                        advantage which was then offset by U.S. technological superiority. The new
                        agreement firmly establishes the principle of equal numbers.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Second,</hi> these limits will be lower and more
                        encompassing than those in the first <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        agreement. The new overall limits would force the Soviets to eliminate over
                        250 strategic missiles and bombers. This is a 10% reduction and about 750
                        fewer than they are likely to have in the absence of <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. On the other hand, because we are below
                        the new limits, we would actually be able, if we chose, to increase the
                        overall number of our strategic weapons in operation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Third,</hi> the agreement will place lower limits on
                        specific weapons, including those with more than a single warhead.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Fourth,</hi> for the first time, we will curb the number
                        of new systems and begin to limit the race to make existing systems more
                        deadly. Only <pb n="565" facs="0606" xml:id="pg_565"/>one new <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM_1">ICBM</gloss> will be permitted to each side. The
                        number of warheads on a single missile would be limited. And there would be
                        restraint on increasing the size of land-based missiles.</p>
                    <p>What would be the major effect of this agreement on our security? Instead of
                        an estimated 3,000 Soviet strategic weapons by 1985, there would be 2,250.
                        The strategic balance will be more stable and, therefore, safer. We will
                        have greater confidence and certainty in our own defense planning. And the
                        defense programs that we and our allies need and have planned can proceed
                        forward on schedule.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Verification and Competition</p>
                    <p>But how do we know the Soviets will not violate the agreement? The answer
                        is—we can see for ourselves.</p>
                    <p>We have powerful and varied systems for observing the Soviets. Besides our
                        photographic satellites, we have other highly sensitive and, therefore,
                        highly classified means of verification. The large size and limited number
                        of bases for intercontinental missiles, heavy bombers, and nuclear
                        submarines eases our task.</p>
                    <p>And the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement itself makes a major
                        contribution. <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II would forbid any
                        interference which would impede our ability to verify compliance with the
                        treaty. And for the first time the Soviets have agreed to regularly exchange
                        precise data with us on each country’s missiles.</p>
                    <p>This is not a new and uncertain challenge. We have monitored Soviet
                        compliance with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I. We know what we
                        can see. And we know that we can detect any violation large enough to affect
                        the strategic balance—and do so in time to respond effectively.</p>
                    <p>Yet with all this, some critics suggest that we should not move ahead with
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, even if it strengthens U.S. and
                        allied security. They contend that Soviet actions elsewhere—in the Third
                        World or on human rights—compel us to withhold approval of <gloss

                    <p>As President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> said two days
                        ago, we “. . . cannot let the pressures of inevitable competition overwhelm
                        possibilities for cooperation any more than [we can permit] cooperation to
                        blind us to the realities of competition . . . .” And the President said
                        this:</p>
                    <p>It is precisely because we have fundamental differences with the Soviet Union
                        that we are determined to bring this most dangerous dimension of our
                        military competition under control.<note n="9" xml:id="d112fn9">For the full

                    <p>We will continue to compete peacefully with the Soviets. In this competition,
                        we hold many cards—not only our military aid but our economic ties, our
                        understanding of diversity, and, most of all, our support for the determined
                        sense of independence in emerging nations around the world.</p>
                    <p>But as we compete, we must also cooperate to limit the most dangerous
                        competition—nuclear weapons. This is in our calculated self-interest. <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> is not a reward for Soviet good
                        behavior. It is a benefit for ourselves and for mankind.</p>
                    <p>With or without <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, competition with the
                        Soviets in many areas will continue. We will respond to any Soviet behavior
                        which adversely affects our interests. Without <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss>, that competition becomes more dangerous, and the
                        possibilities for cooperation are dimmed.</p>
                    <p>We must recognize our overwhelming strengths as a nation. We must see the
                        future not as a threat but as an opportunity to make our children’s lives
                        safer and more rewarding than our own. The emerging <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement represents such an
                        opportunity.</p>
                    <p>Military competition today is carried out in highly technical terms. The
                        debates on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> will be very complex. Let
                        us not, as we explore the technicalities in all the detail they deserve,
                        lose sight of these simple truths: A nuclear war would destroy much—if not
                        all—of what we love. We must do everything in our power to see that it never
                        happens. We prevent it today with a military defense strong enough to deter
                        our potential adversaries. We will maintain that deterrence.</p>
                    <p>But that alone will not make us secure. We must also, at long last, reverse
                        the dangerous race in nuclear weapons that each year increases nuclear
                        stockpiles and each year makes us less safe. That is what <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> is about.</p>
                    <p>With the vision that set him apart from other men, <persName
                            corresp="#p_HHH_1">Hubert Humphrey</persName> defined our present
                        challenge over a decade ago. He not only cared deeply, he thought deeply
                        about the nature of America’s security in a nuclear world.</p>
                    <p>Nuclear power has placed into the hands of men the power to destroy all that
                        man has created. Only responsive statesmen—who perceive that perseverence in
                        the pursuit of peace is not cowardice but courage, that restraint in the use
                        of force is not weakness but wisdom—can prevent international rivalries from
                        leading to an incinerated world.</p>
                    <p>Let us have Hubert’s wisdom—and summon Hubert’s courage—as we set the course
                        which will help define our future for years to come.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Foreign Policy: Tone and Orchestration</p>
                    <p>You confront a paradox: everyone who has met with you, whether it be mass
                        media dinner guests or participants in the Congressional foreign policy
                        briefings, afterwards invariably say how immensely impressed they were by
                        your mastery of foreign policy, by your knowledge of details, and by your
                        ability to relate that knowledge to a broad vision. Just last night I was
                        told that Mrs. Reston<note n="2" xml:id="d113fn2">Reference is to journalist
                            Sally Reston, married to syndicated columnist James “Scotty”
                            Reston.</note> commented after a dinner with you that she cannot recall
                        any President who could match you in that regard. After one of the
                        Congressional briefings, <persName corresp="#p_OTP_1">Tip O’Neill</persName>
                        said that no one can have the slightest doubt that you are not only fully in
                        charge of foreign policy but that you have a clear and coherent picture as
                        to where this country ought to be heading.<note n="3" xml:id="d113fn3">In
                            the right-hand margin next to this paragraph, the President wrote “good
                            idea” and drew an arrow pointing downward from the comment.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Yet at the same time, it is a fact that both abroad and increasingly at home
                        the United States is seen as indecisive, vacillating, and pursuing a policy
                        of acquiescence. We are perceived as neither responding effectively to
                        Soviet assertiveness and as unable to generate a broad strategy that is
                        relevant to the times.</p>
                    <p>Why this incongruity?</p>
                    <p>Part of the answer, I suppose, is to be found in what you said at the State
                        Department the other day: we live in a complex age, and complexity does not
                        lend itself to simple explanations.<note n="4" xml:id="d113fn4">On February
                            22, the President took part in a foreign policy conference at the
                            Department of State for editors and broadcasters. In his opening remarks
                            the President asserted: “Looking back over the last several years,
                            particularly the last 2 years, I’ve been struck by the increasing
                            complexity, however, of international affairs. I’m encouraged by what I
                            judge to be a willingness on behalf of the American people to attempt to
                            understand complex issues, not to oversimplify them, and to support
                            policies and decisions that basically and openly address these complex
                            issues responsibly and realistically.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers:

                        can no longer reduce challenges to a single phenomenon, be it Hitlerism or
                        Stalinism. However, I suspect that part of the problem is also to be located
                        on a less philosophical plane, with some of it related to tone and
                        orchestration.</p>
                    <p>For example, I think a genuine problem has been created by the press’s
                        fascination, exploitation and magnification of the so-called <persName
                            corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>- rivalry. To be sure, some
                        differences do exist and you are not only aware of them, but, as you have
                        often said, you do want divergent viewpoints presented to you. At the same
                        time, the fact is that on most matters Cy and I are in basic agreement, and
                        there has been no underhanded maneuvering to have one’s point of view
                        prevail.</p>
                    <p>As one looks back on previous administrations, one can note similar
                        divergences, and in the case of <gloss target="#t_FDR_1">FDR</gloss> they
                        were certainly much wider philosophically and more intense. The real
                        difference is that <gloss target="#t_FDR_1">FDR</gloss> was seen as
                        orchestrating and deliberately exploiting such differences whereas the press
                        is now creating the impression that you are buffeted by them. You know and
                        we know that this is not so, but it is the perception that is damaging.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, it would be very useful if you took some deliberate steps to
                        demonstrate that you are exploiting the differences while pursuing a steady
                        course. Schram in a recent story asserted that this is exactly what you are
                        doing and it was the first positive expression of that view.<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d113fn5">Presumable reference to Martin Schram, “Birth of a
                            Notion,” <hi rend="italic">The Washington Post,</hi> January 24, 1979,
                            pp. A–1, A–8. Schram referenced a January 2 meeting at the White House,
                            during which the President, <persName corresp="#p_MWF_1"
                                >Mondale</persName>, and several White House aides discussed the
                            upcoming State of the Union address. The meeting, Schram noted,
                            generated a broader philosophical discussion about possible themes for
                            the <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> administration. He
                            continued: “New Foundation. As the <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                                >Carter</persName> advisers came to see it, the theme stands for a
                            new approach to today’s problems. A new way of taking a long-range look
                            at what is wrong and a new way of solving things on a long-range
                            basis—heavy on concept but spare on promises.” (Ibid., p. A–1)</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>One way to achieve that objective would be to use Cy soon and visibly in
                        relationship to China, and to use me in some fashion in relationship to the
                        Soviet Union. For example, you told <persName corresp="#p_DX_1"
                            >Deng</persName> that the United States and China should have regular
                        consultations. When the crisis in Indochina is over, it would be useful for
                        Cy and some of his top assistants to go to Peking at your direction to
                        engage in high-level discussions. Similarly, it might be useful, and
                        domestically even appealing, to have me spend a couple of days in Moscow in
                        consultations with the <pb n="569" facs="0610" xml:id="pg_569"/>Soviets on
                        issues of common concern, perhaps with my counterpart who works for
                        Brezhnev. This could be in preparation for the Summit.<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d113fn6">Reference is to the summit meeting between the
                            President and Brezhnev, scheduled to take place in Vienna June 16–18;

                    </p>
                    <p>With reference to the latter, I should note that we really have not had
                        sustained and truly tough-minded “consultations” with the Soviets since you
                        took office. Most of Cy’s sessions have been primarily negotiating ones, and
                        I suspect that some of the misunderstandings that exist are due to
                        suspicions that have become more intense. <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1"
                            >Kissinger</persName>, even while bombing Hanoi, did engage in such
                        forthright consultations with the Soviets and they were mutually helpful in
                        defining more precisely the limits of what is tolerable and what is not. At
                        the minimum, I would suggest engaging in some soul searching with <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> here on the basis of guidance
                        cleared by you and Cy.</p>
                    <p>In addition, it might be useful for Cy to give a foreign policy speech in
                        which he would stress some of the themes that you have recently expressed:
                        the importance of power, and our recognition that relations with the Soviet
                        Union may require from time to time a forceful American reaffirmation of our
                        interests (e.g., in relationship to Iran, or peace in the Far East, or the
                        Soviet military buildup). I am scheduled to give a speech before the Council
                        on Foreign Relations in Chicago some time in late March or early April and
                        my plan is to use it, subject to your approval, for a strong defense on

                            successes, among them the announcement of the China trip, a breakthrough
                            in the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> negotiations, an extremely
                            popular and apparently effective economic program including a freeze of

                            things gave us a momentum that carried right into the presidential

                    <p>On March 5, 1979, White House Press Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PJL_1"
                            >Jody Powell</persName> announced that Egyptian President <persName

                            <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Menachem Begin</persName> had invited
                        President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Jimmy Carter</persName> to Egypt and
                        Israel, respectively, to discuss the “peace process, regional security, and
                        bilateral issues.” <persName corresp="#p_PJL_1">Powell</persName> indicated
                        that the President would depart Washington for Egypt on March 7 and would
                        then proceed to Israel on March 10. (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers:

                        page 383) In remarks prior to his departure, the President asserted: “So, it
                        is with hope that I depart, hope tempered by sober realism. As a friend of
                        Egypt and a friend of Israel, we will do our best to help them achieve the
                        peace that they have paid for in blood many times over.</p>
                    <p>“In doing this, in seeking to lay the basis for a stable and a peaceful
                        Middle East, we will also be serving our own deepest national interests and

                        Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>On the morning of March 10, the Presidential party departed Alexandria for
                        Cairo via helicopter. At 1 p.m., the President addressed the People’s
                        Assembly of Egypt, which had convened in the Assembly Chamber of the
                        People’s Assembly Building. Following his introductory remarks, the
                        President turned to the efforts made the previous fall:</p>
                    <p>“Last September, the course of negotiations took the President of Egypt and
                        the Prime Minister of Israel to Camp David, in the wooded mountains near the
                        Capital of the United States of America.</p>
                    <p>“Out of our discussion there came two agreements: A framework within which
                        peace between Israel and all her neighbors might be achieved, and the
                        legitimate rights of the Palestinian people realized—and also an outline for
                        a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, in the context of a comprehensive
                        peace for the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>“Those agreements were rooted in United Nations Security Council Resolution
                        242, which established the basic equation between <pb n="571" facs="0612"
                            xml:id="pg_571"/>an Arab commitment to peace and Israeli withdrawal in
                        the context of security. The treaty which is now being negotiated between
                        Egypt and Israel reflects those principles.</p>
                    <p>“Since the two agreements were signed, we have been working to bring both of
                        them to fruition. The United States has served as a mediator—not to press
                        either party to accept provisions that are inconsistent with its basic
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>“In these negotiations, a crucial question has involved the relationship
                        between an Egyptian-Israeli treaty and the broader peace envisioned and
                        committed at Camp David. I believe that this body and the people of Egypt
                        deserve to know my thinking on the subject.</p>
                    <p>“When two nations conclude a treaty with one another, they have every right
                        to expect that the terms of that treaty will be carried out faithfully and
                        steadfastly. At the same time, there can be little doubt that the two
                        agreements reached at Camp David—negotiated together and signed together—are
                        related, and that a comprehensive peace remains a common objective.</p>
                    <p>“Just in recent days, both Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BM_1"
                            >Begin</persName> in Washington and President <persName
                            corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> here in Egypt have again pledged to
                        carry out every commitment made at Camp David.</p>
                    <p>“Both leaders have reaffirmed that they do not want a separate peace between
                        their two nations. Therefore, our current efforts to complete the treaty
                        negotiations represent not the end of a process, but the beginning of one,
                        for a treaty between Egypt and Israel is an indispensible part of a
                        comprehensive peace.</p>
                    <p>“I pledge to you today that I also remain personally committed to move on to
                        negotiations concerning the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and other issues of
                        concern to the Palestinians and also to future negotiations between Israel
                        and all her neighbors. I feel a personal obligation in this regard.</p>
                    <p>“Only the path of negotiation and accommodation can lead to the fulfillment
                        of the hopes of the Palestinian people for peaceful self-expression. The
                        negotiations proposed in the Camp David agreements will provide them with an
                        opportunity to participate in the determination of their own future. We urge
                        representative Palestinians to take part in these negotiations.</p>
                    <p>“We are ready to work with any who are willing to talk peace. Those who
                        attack these efforts are opposing the only realistic prospect that can bring
                        real peace to the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>“Let no one be deceived. The effect of their warlike slogans and their
                        rhetoric is to make them in reality advocates of the status quo, not change;
                        advocates of war, not peace; advocates of further suffering, not <pb n="572"
                            facs="0613" xml:id="pg_572"/>of achieving the human dignity to which
                        long-suffering people of this region are entitled.</p>
                    <p>“There is simply no workable alternative to the course that your nation and
                        my nation are now following together. The conclusion of a treaty between
                        Israel and Egypt will enable your government to mobilize its resources not
                        for war, but for the provision of a better life for every Egyptian.</p>
                    <p>“I know how deeply President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> is
                        committed to that quest. And I believe its achievement will ultimately be
                        his greatest legacy to the people he serves so well.</p>
                    <p>“My government, for its part, the full power and influence of the United
                        States of America, is ready to share that burden of that commitment with
                        you. These gains which we envision will not come quickly or easily, but they
                        will come.</p>
                    <p>“The conclusion of the peace treaty that we are discussing will strengthen
                        cooperation between Egypt and the United States in other ways. I fully share
                        and will support President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>’s
                        belief that stability must be maintained in this part of the world, even
                        while constructive change is actively encouraged. He and I recognize that
                        the security of this vital region is being challenged. I applaud his
                        determination to meet that challenge, and my government will stand with
                        him.</p>
                    <p>“Our policy is that each nation should have the ability to defend itself, so
                        that it does not have to depend on external alliances for its own security.
                        The United States does not seek a special position for itself.</p>
                    <p>“If we are successful in our efforts to conclude a comprehensive peace, it
                        will be presented obviously, each element of it, to this body for
                        ratification.</p>
                    <p>“It is in the nature of negotiation that no treaty can be ideal or perfect
                        from either the Egyptian or Israeli point of view. The question we’ve faced
                        all along, however, is not whether the treaty we negotiate will meet all the
                        immediate desires of each of the two parties, but whether it will protect
                        the vital interests of both and further the cause for peace for all the
                        states and all the peoples of this region. That is the basic purpose and the
                        most difficult question which we are resolved to answer.</p>
                    <p>“Such a treaty, such an agreement, is within our grasp. Let us seize this
                        opportunity while we have it.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName

                        the Israeli Knesset. In his opening remarks, the President affirmed the U.S.
                        commitment to Israel before turning to a discussion of the peace
                        process:</p>
                    <p>“At Camp David, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Begin</persName>
                        and President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> forged two
                        frameworks for the building of that comprehensive peace. The genius of that
                        accomplishment is that negotiations under these frameworks can go forward
                        independently of each other, without destroying the obvious relationship
                        between them.</p>
                    <p>“They are designed to be mutually reinforcing, with the intrinsic flexibility
                        necessary to promote the comprehensive peace that we all desire. Both will
                        be fulfilled only when others of your Arab neighbors follow the visionary
                        example of President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>, when they
                        put ancient animosities behind them and agree to negotiate, as you desire,
                        as you’ve already done with President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1"
                            >Sadat</persName>, an honorable solution to the differences between
                        you.</p>
                    <p>“It’s important that the door be kept open to all the parties to the
                        conflict, including the Palestinians, with whom, above all, Israel shares a
                        common interest in living in peace and living with mutual respect.</p>
                    <p>“Peace in the Middle East, always important to the security of the entire
                        region, in recent weeks has become an even more urgent concern.</p>
                    <p>“Israel’s security will rest not only on how the negotiations affect the
                        situation on your own borders but also on how it affects the forces of
                        stability and moderation beyond your borders.</p>
                    <p>“I’m convinced that nothing can do more to create a hospitable atmosphere for
                        those more distant forces in the long run than an equitable peace treaty
                        between Israel and Egypt.</p>
                    <p>“The risks of peace between you and your Egyptian neighbors are real. But
                        America is ready to reduce any risks and to balance them within the bounds
                        of our strength and our influence.</p>
                    <p>“I came to Israel representing the most powerful country on Earth. And I can
                        assure you that the United States intends to use that power in the pursuit
                        of a stable and a peaceful Middle East.</p>
                    <pb n="574" facs="0615" xml:id="pg_574"/>
                    <p>“We’ve been centrally involved in this region, and we will stay involved
                        politically, economically, and militarily. We will stand by our friends. We
                        are ready to place our strength at Israel’s side when you want it to ensure
                        Israel’s security and well-being.</p>
                    <p>“We know Israel’s concern about many issues. We know your concern for an
                        adequate oil supply. In the context of peace, we are ready to guarantee that
                        supply.</p>
                    <p>“I’ve recommitted our Nation publicly to this commitment, as you know, only
                        in recent days in my own country.</p>
                    <p>“We know Israel’s concern that the price of peace with Egypt will exacerbate
                        an already difficult economic situation and make it more difficult to meet
                        your country’s essential security requirements. In the context of peace, we
                        are prepared to see Israel’s economic and military relationship with the
                        United States take on new and strong and more meaningful dimensions, even
                        than already exist.</p>
                    <p>“We will work not only to attain peace but to maintain peace, recognizing
                        that it’s a permanent challenge of our time.</p>
                    <p>“We will rededicate ourselves to the ideals that our peoples share. These
                        ideals are the course [<hi rend="italic">cause</hi>?] not only of our
                        strength but of our self-respect as nations, as leaders, and as
                        individuals.</p>
                    <p>“I’m here today to reaffirm that the United States will always recognize,
                        appreciate, and honor the mutual advantages of the strength and security of
                        Israel. And I’m here to express my most heartfelt and passionate hope that
                        we may work together successfully to make this peace.” (<hi rend="italic"

                    <p rend="center">America’s Commitment to Third World Development</p>
                    <p>These past weeks have been a time to deal with immediate diplomatic issues of
                        extraordinary importance to our nation. Tonight I want to speak about an
                        issue that may seem less immediate but is no less important: our approach to
                        the economic future of the developing nations.</p>
                    <p>Before turning to our strategy toward the North-South dialogue between the
                        industrial and developing nations, let me first talk for a moment about why
                        the development of Third World countries matters to us.</p>
                    <p>Its human dimension is clear. At least ½-billion people regularly go hungry
                        in a world of plenty. A half-billion is an abstract number, another
                        statistic among many and, therefore, too easily dismissed. But when we pause
                        to picture in our minds how much human suffering lies behind that single
                        statistic, the scope of our moral challenge is evident. The continuation of
                        that suffering is an affront to the conscience of men and women
                        everywhere.</p>
                    <p>Americans have long recognized this challenge: We have generously shared our
                        resources in times of tragedy and need abroad, from the great hunger in
                        Ireland in 1847, to the Marshall plan and point 4 program<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d115fn2">Reference is to the <persName corresp="#p_THS_1"
                                >Truman</persName> administration’s program for technical

                        later. We are determined today, despite budgetary stringency, to live up to
                        that historic moral responsibility.</p>
                    <pb n="576" facs="0617" xml:id="pg_576"/>
                    <p>Our humanitarian commitment is reinforced by the recognition that it also
                        serves our national self-interest to assist the process of equitable growth
                        within the developing nations. We need to help shape an international
                        economic system which will support and stimulate that growth.</p>
                    <p>Here on this Pacific rim, you know well a fact that is true for our entire
                        nation: that your prosperity and well-being depend on the increasing
                        prosperity and well-being of others throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>Some 75% of the Northwest’s wheat crop is sold on world markets. Fully
                        one-third of western Washington’s forest products economy is dependent on
                        those markets, and that dependence is increasing.</p>
                    <p>One dollar in eight in this State’s economy comes directly from international
                        trade. More than a quarter of a million jobs in Washington and Oregon alone
                        depend on exports.</p>
                    <p>Much of this trade, as you know, is with developing countries. Four of the
                        State’s 10 biggest export customers are developing countries. Seven of the
                        State’s biggest sources of imports—imports without which your economy could
                        not function—are developing countries.</p>
                    <p>These countries of the Third World are increasingly involved in our daily
                        lives. We know how oil from these countries affects us. As a nation, we also
                        get more than 50% of the tin, rubber, and manganese we need from less
                        developed countries and substantial amounts of our tungsten and cobalt. We
                        now export more to the developing countries, including the Organization of
                        Petroleum Exporting Countries, than to the Common Market, Japan, and the
                        Communist countries combined. For example, almost one-half of our commercial
                        aircraft sales abroad are to developing nations.</p>
                    <p>So, as we survey and address questions of the evolving international economic
                        order, we do not do so on some abstract basis. We do so as a matter of
                        economic self-interest and, for some sectors of our economy, of
                        survival.</p>
                    <p>The participation of the developing countries is also essential to solving
                        pressing global problems that will shape the character of our future.
                        Inefficient and wasteful use of the Earth’s resources, pollution of the
                        oceans and atmosphere, nuclear proliferation, unchecked arms competition,
                        all of these involve the well-being and safety of the human race. None can
                        be solved without the involvement of the developing nations.</p>
                    <p>Most countries of the Third World have too little food and rapidly growing
                        populations. We face the prospect of a population increase in the final
                        quarter of this century which will equal the entire growth of world
                        population from the birth of Christ to 1950. Roughly 90% of this increase
                        will be in developing countries. And perhaps more troubling, <pb n="577"
                            facs="0618" xml:id="pg_577"/>this growth seems certain to be greatest in
                        already hard-pressed urban centers. Imagine, if you can, what current
                        projections would indicate: a Mexico City with 32 million people; a Sao
                        Paulo with 26 million; Calcutta, Bombay, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul, Beijing, and
                        Shanghai each with some 19 million in 20 years or so.</p>
                    <p>We all recognize that the developing countries themselves bear the major
                        burden for responding to these challenges. The industrial countries,
                        however, can play a crucial role in assisting their efforts. Whether, and
                        how, we help the developing nations in pursuing their development goals is
                        one of the central issues of our time.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">U.S. Approach</p>
                    <p>Our approach to development in the Third World is based on four fundamental
                        tenets.</p>

                        requires facilitating adjustment in our own economy in ways which will
                        support economic growth in the Third World.</p>

                        respond to the particular needs of the developing nations, and which accord
                        them an appropriate voice in decisions that affect them. By the same token,
                        we believe firmly that as nations develop and grow stronger, they incur
                        increasing responsibility to contribute to, as well as gain from, the
                        international economy.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Third,</hi> despite the economic pressures we and other
                        industrial nations now face, the United States remains committed to
                        increasing transfers of resources from the richer to the poorer nations.</p>
                    <p>Let me emphasize, however, a <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> point. As we
                        cooperate with developing nations in seeking useful changes in the
                        international system, and as we consider the level and nature of our
                        resource flows, we must be clear about our priorities. Alterations in the
                        international system and resource transfers among nations are not ends in
                        themselves. They are a means to the compelling goal of development within
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>We cannot spend so much time and energy on our international discussions of
                        the roadmap that we lose sight of our destination. The destination—the goal
                        we share—is to find practical ways to have an appreciable impact on the
                        lives of people around the world, and especially on the lives of those for
                        whom daily survival is an unanswered question.</p>
                    <p>We envision an international economic system which is not rigidly divided
                        into northern and southern blocs. We seek a global community <pb n="578"
                            facs="0619" xml:id="pg_578"/>which furthers the well-being of all
                        countries, in which all recognize the responsibilities of each to the
                        others, in which the richer help the poorer for the benefit of all, in which
                        international deliberations are focused as much on practical ways of serving
                        human needs as on levels of resource flows among nations, and in which every
                        nation dedicates itself to economic justice as well as economic growth.</p>
                    <p>We can help build such a system in a number of ways: in our closer
                        cooperation with the other industrial nations, constantly taking account of
                        the effect on each other of our domestic decisions; in encouraging
                        constructive involvement of Communist nations in the promotion of a healthy
                        global economic system; in our positive participation in the current
                        North-South dialogue, and in our search for practical programs that can best
                        promote Third World development.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">North-South Negotiations</p>
                    <p>Let me concentrate today on the negotiations that are taking place between
                        industrial and developing nations and the practical focus on development
                        itself that we hope can be achieved.</p>
                    <p>The distinction between industrial and developing nations, between North and
                        South, is clearly eroding. The industrial and agricultural performance of
                        some of the developing nations now surpasses that of some of the industrial
                        countries. But negotiations between North and South remain valuable. While
                        we believe a broader global community is emerging in which rigid economic
                        blocs no longer predominate, we understand the importance the developing
                        countries attach to the Group of 77. The developing nations can use their
                        cohesion to bring greater clarity and purpose to our negotiations.</p>
                    <p>We face an unusually large number of important international conferences in
                        the coming 18 months. These meetings provide an extraordinary opportunity
                        for progress on issues of importance to developing nations—and to us
                        all.</p>
                    <p>As we prepare for them, we must first recognize the progress that already has
                        been made. Last week in Geneva, for example, agreement was reached on most
                        of the basic elements of a common fund to help finance international buffer
                        stocks and other commodity development measures.<note n="3" xml:id="d115fn3"
                            >Negotiations on the Common Fund resumed in Geneva on March 12. On March

                        This marks an important milestone in a process launched at the fourth U.N.
                        Conference on Trade and Development in 1976. Over the past 2½ years of
                        intensive negotiations, all participants moved from their original positions
                        in search of common ground. The negotiations <pb n="579" facs="0620"
                            xml:id="pg_579"/>now move into a more technical phase leading to the
                        drafting of articles of agreement, a process which could be concluded as
                        early as the end of this year.</p>
                    <p>In the past few years, industrial nations and international institutions have
                        undertaken a number of other important measures of concrete benefit to the
                        developing countries.</p>
                    <p>• Multilateral and bilateral aid flows have increased steadily in recent
                        years. Agreements have recently been or will soon be concluded to enable the
                        multilateral development banks to increase significantly, in real terms,
                        their lending levels over the next 3 to 4 years.</p>
                    <p>• Resources available through the International Monetary Fund (<gloss
                            target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>) for financing balance-of-payments
                        difficulties have been substantially increased—through liberalization of the
                            <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> Compensatory Financing Facility;
                        through the fourth <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss> quota increase; and
                        through the establishment of new <gloss target="#t_IMF_1">IMF</gloss>
                        facilities including the trust fund and the $10-billion Witteveen
                        facility.</p>
                    <p>• Consuming countries have agreed to the concept of shared responsibility
                        with producing countries for financing buffer stocks to stabilize prices in
                        commodity markets. Agreements for coffee and tin were renegotiated; a new
                        agreement for sugar has been reached;<note n="4" xml:id="d115fn4">These
                            agreements regulated commodity prices and sales among signatories. The
                            United States signed the most recent versions of the coffee agreement in
                            1975, the tin agreement in 1976, and the sugar agreement in 1977.</note>
                        and negotiations on rubber and a new cocoa agreement are underway. Such
                        agreements can have important anti-inflationary benefits for our own
                        economy.</p>
                    <p>• All Western industrial countries have implemented preferential tariff
                        systems for developing countries. The multilateral trade negotiations will
                        provide new opportunities for all nations to increase their economic
                        welfare. Just as consumers and producers will benefit in our own country, so
                        they can gain in the developing world.</p>
                    <p>• And donor countries have agreed to the concept of easing or eliminating the
                        official debt burden of the poorest countries.</p>
                    <p>The United States has played a leading role in many of these and other
                        international initiatives and we have taken national measures to support
                        them.</p>
                    <p>• We have increased our foreign economic assistance from $3.7 billion in
                        fiscal year 1975 to $7 billion in fiscal year 1979.</p>
                    <p>• In the commodities field, the United States is a member of the tin
                        agreement, and we intend to make a contribution to the tin buffer stock. We
                        are seeking Senate approval to join the sugar agreement, and we hope to
                        conclude new cocoa and rubber agreements in which we can <pb n="580"

                    <p>In short, there has been real progress. But far more remains to be done in
                        concluding agreements to stabilize commodity markets, bringing the
                        developing nations more fully into the world trading system and implementing
                        the new codes and tariff reductions of the multilateral trade negotiations,
                        facilitating the adjustment of domestic <pb n="581" facs="0622"
                            xml:id="pg_581"/>economies to changing patterns of world trade, arriving
                        at a common understanding of the responsibilities of both governments and
                        corporations to create a better environment for international investment and
                        the flow of technology, assuring adequate assistance to nations facing acute
                        financial difficulties, strengthening the scientific and technological
                        capabilities of developing countries, increasing aid flows to countries
                        which need it most and can use it effectively, and finding ways to assure an
                        appropriate role for developing countries in international economic
                        institutions.</p>
                    <p>This is a heavy agenda. And these are difficult times in which to address it,
                        since most of the industrial nations face difficult domestic economic
                        challenges.</p>
                    <p>In a period of fiscal austerity, there is a danger, which we must frankly
                        address, that negotiations between North and South could return to the
                        rancor of earlier years. This will happen if each nation becomes so
                        concerned with its own problems that it forgets the essential reality of an
                        interdependent age: that each nation can surmount its own difficulties only
                        if it understands and helps resolve the difficulties of others as well.</p>
                    <p>The industrial nations must maintain their commitment to the well-being of
                        the developing nations. The developing nations must recognize that making
                        demands which the industrial nations cannot meet will only produce
                        international acrimony, not progress. And the oil-producing nations must
                        recognize their special responsibilities for the health of the global
                        economy and their fundamental stake in its continued vitality.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A Practical Focus</p>
                    <p>This brings me to a central point. Our progress in North-South
                        negotiations—our progress toward a more equitable and healthy new
                        international economic order—will turn on our common ability to avoid
                        endless debates on sterile texts and to focus instead on concrete
                        development problems which we can tackle together and which directly affect
                        people’s lives.</p>
                    <p>Only by focusing on practical ways to meet human needs can we remain clear
                        about our goals and clear in explaining them to our peoples. I know that the
                        American people will never be convinced that there is an inherent value only
                        in resource flows among nations. They want to know, and have a right to
                        know, how their taxes are being used to better the lives of people
                        abroad.</p>
                    <p>It is this practical—and human—focus which compels us to concentrate our aid
                        on programs that directly improve the lives of poorer people abroad. We
                        believe it is important that we concentrate our re<pb n="582" facs="0623"

                    <p>This approach is not only this Administration’s policy. It has been expressed

                    <p>Growth without equity can lead to a situation in which a growing economic pie
                        is cut into ever more unequal pieces. Equity without growth can lead to a
                        situation where a shrinking economic pie is cut into equal but ever smaller
                        pieces. Neither situation can lead to long-term political or economic
                        health. Both growth and equity are necessary.</p>
                    <p>A practical focus also requires that we be clear about our priorities. Thus
                        while we will continue to work with the developing countries in addressing
                        the future of the international political and economic system, we intend
                        increasingly to concentrate on specific development goals: energy, food,
                        health, and increasing the capacity of the developing countries to obtain
                        and apply the knowledge and technology they need.</p>
                    <p>There is good reason for seeking international emphasis on each of these
                        areas:</p>
                    <p>• An ample supply of energy at reasonable prices is essential to economic
                        advancement. It is also a key to our own prosperity.</p>
                    <p>• Adequate food and good health are basic to human survival and
                        productivity.</p>
                    <p>• And the ability of people and institutions in the developing countries to
                        obtain, develop, adapt, and apply technology is critical to most development
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>Let me illustrate these priorities today by describing our current efforts
                        and future plans in two areas—energy and food. In the coming months and in
                        other forums such as the U.N. Conference on Science and Technology for
                        Development and the World Health Assembly, we will be addressing the others
                        as well.<note n="10" xml:id="d115fn10">The conferences were scheduled to

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Energy</p>
                    <p>No issue we face today more clearly demonstrates the interests we share with
                        the people of the developing world than energy. The commuter buying gasoline
                        in Seattle and the peasant farmer buying kerosene near Khartoum both face
                        the harsh reality of rising world petroleum prices. Governments in the
                        richest countries and those in the poorest must deal with the impact of
                        higher energy costs and rising energy demand on their national
                        economies.</p>
                    <p>Let me be frank. The worldwide energy situation, already serious, is likely
                        to get worse before it gets better. For the foreseeable future, in the
                        absence of substantial new efforts, worldwide growth in energy demand will
                        continue to outpace worldwide growth in energy production.</p>
                    <p>We must do what is necessary in our own country to restrain consumption and
                        increase domestic production. But we cannot solve the energy problem by what
                        we do here alone. It is a global challenge.</p>
                    <p>Thus, we have a direct interest in helping developing countries devise their
                        own effective energy policies—helping them identify their energy resources,
                        determine their current and future energy demand, identify the technology
                        they need, and obtain the necessary financing. Let me tell you what we are
                        already doing in each of these areas.</p>
                    <p>We are now helping several developing countries survey their national energy
                        resources, define their future energy needs, and construct alternative
                        energy strategies.</p>
                    <p>With our strong support, the World Bank is significantly expanding its
                        program to help developing countries finance further exploration and
                        development of fossil fuels. The Bank envisages loans amounting to as much
                        as $3 billion over the next 5 years.</p>
                    <p>We are devoting substantial financial resources to research on renewable
                        energy sources. In addition to private financing, the Department of Energy
                        has budgeted over $600 million this year to study, develop, and demonstrate
                        renewable energy technology. We have asked the Congress for more than $700
                        million for these efforts next year. These programs can lead to
                        technological developments that directly benefit the developing nations.</p>
                    <p>The Agency for International Development (<gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                            >AID</gloss>) has requested $42 million in <gloss target="#t_FY_1"

                    <p>We have accelerated our training and technical assistance programs for energy
                        professionals and institutions in the developing countries. We have proposed
                        a new institute for scientific and technological cooperation, which would
                        become an important element of our foreign <pb n="584" facs="0625"

                        will be a major focus of the work of the institute as it both helps
                        strengthen scientific and technological capacities in developing countries
                        and also identifies domestic American research relevant to development

                        loans and guarantees to developing countries in fiscal year 1978. This has
                        produced more than $3 billion in U.S. exports of energy equipment. The World
                        Bank, to which we are the largest contributor, has already provided about
                        $10 billion for financing of conventional power projects. And the other

                    <p>• We will respond positively to additional requests from developing nations
                        for help in evaluating their energy resources, needs, and strategies.</p>
                    <p>• We will encourage the regional development banks to expand their energy
                        programs and to consider new approaches to encourage further private capital
                        flows into mineral and energy development in their regions.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>• With strong U.S. backing, the United Nations will hold a World Conference
                        on New and Renewable Energy in 1981. We intend to play an active role in
                        that effort.</p>
                    <p>• We will increase our support for research, development, and training
                        efforts of national and regional energy institutions in developing
                        countries. We will encourage other nations to join us in this effort.</p>
                    <p>• We will also work with other nations to determine whether it would be
                        useful to supplement the work of such institutions. Together we will seek to
                        identify gaps in current efforts, and ways to fill them, including the
                        possible establishment of new institutions. For example, <pb n="585"
                            facs="0626" xml:id="pg_585"/>international research centers—which enjoy
                        support from developed and developing countries, private organizations, and
                        multilateral institutions—have played a major role in addressing developing
                        country agricultural problems. If, as a result of discussions with our
                        colleagues in developed and developing countries, there is agreement that
                        this approach would be appropriate in the field of energy, the United States
                        would support such international energy centers.</p>
                    <p>• We must assure that as new renewable energy technology becomes relatively
                        less expensive, adequate financing is available for the developing countries
                        to acquire it. We will ask the World Bank to undertake a thorough review of
                        this question.</p>
                    <p>These steps and others we will be discussing with developed and developing
                        countries in the months ahead can help assure that high energy costs do not
                        undermine economic growth and a steadily improving way of life for those who
                        live in the developing world.</p>
                    <p>Our future economic well-being and theirs carries an inescapable imperative:
                        We must work together to expand the availability of energy for developed and
                        developing countries alike. There is no promise for any of us in an
                        intensifying competition for limited energy supplies.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Food</p>
                    <p>Let me turn to a second development priority which we intend to focus on in
                        the months ahead—the stark fact that one out of every five of our fellow
                        human beings is sick or weak or hungry because he or she simply does not
                        have enough to eat.</p>
                    <p>In one respect, this is a question of the equity with which economic benefits
                        are distributed. Millions are too poor to buy food, even when it is
                        available. As I have stressed, our overall development efforts must address
                        this fundamental issue.</p>
                    <p>But it is also clear that in many developing countries, food production is
                        not keeping pace with population growth. The long-range prospects point to
                        even greater food deficits in developing countries in the years ahead. Not
                        only will we approach the limits of new land to cultivate, but soil erosion,
                        desert encroachment, and simple overuse are robbing the world’s historic
                        breadbaskets of their productive capacity because of inadequate land and
                        resource management practices.</p>
                    <p>The United States is already doing a great deal to increase the availability
                        of food in the developing world. Roughly half of our bilateral economic
                        development assistance—approximately $600 million this year—is devoted to
                        agriculture and rural development. We provide roughly two-thirds of the
                        world’s concessionary food assistance. Our contribution this year will
                        amount to $1.4 billion. And we have contributed $200 million to the
                        International Fund for Agricultural Development.</p>

                    <p>But, as with energy, we must and will do more. Last September the President

                    <p>The agricultural research breakthroughs of the past decade and a half have
                        been of enormous benefit to the developing world—with improved plant
                        strains, better animal breeds, and more efficient farming techniques. Much
                        of this research has concentrated on cereal crops and cattle. While
                        continuing research in these areas, we must now devote greater attention to
                        some of the traditional crops and animals raised by poor farmers on marginal
                        lands and to less widely grown crops that <pb n="587" facs="0628"
                            xml:id="pg_587"/>hold promise as new sources of food and income. These
                        will be major agricultural priorities of the institute for scientific and
                        technological cooperation. Other government agencies will also increase
                        their support for such research.</p>
                    <p>We must also do more to prevent the tragic loss of 10–20% of the food which
                        is produced each year in the developing countries. More food is lost to
                        rodents, insects, and spoilage in the developing world than all the food aid
                        to the developing world combined. We are already a major contributor to the
                        Food and Agriculture Organization’s post-harvest loss fund, and both <gloss
                            target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> and the new institute will be devoting
                        increasing resources to finding better ways to assure that what people toil
                        to produce is available to sustain them.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we intend to channel our food and development assistance
                        increasingly to countries which are seeking to adopt domestic policies which
                        encourage their own food production and equitable distribution and promote
                        better use of water and land resources. We intend to participate actively in
                        the upcoming World Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development which
                        will be addressing these essential questions.<note n="19" xml:id="d115fn19"

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion</p>
                    <p>Programs such as those I have mentioned today are no cure-all. But they come
                        to grips with the most pressing problems of the developing countries, and
                        they will make a difference where it counts most—in the daily lives of
                        people. They will insure that more people in the developing countries will
                        have enough food to eat, that fewer children will die in infancy, that there
                        is sufficient energy to power more irrigation pumps and to bring more heat
                        and light to distant villages.</p>
                    <p>The resources we can bring to bear may seem small in comparison to the
                        magnitude of the problems which must be solved. But let us remember that
                        development is a long-term process. Our hopes for the coming decades are
                        lifted by the fact that people are better off in most developing countries
                        today than they were two decades ago.</p>
                    <p>Life expectancy in the developing world in the past two decades has jumped
                        from 42 to over 50, an increase which took the industrial nations a century
                        to accomplish. Adult literacy in the developing world has jumped from
                        one-third in 1950 to over one-half. In the past quarter of a century, per
                        capita income in the developing countries grew on the average of almost 3% a
                        year. This is about 50% better than historical growth rates in Western
                        nations during their industrialization.</p>
                    <pb n="588" facs="0629" xml:id="pg_588"/>
                    <p>This is not cause to be sanguine; but it is reason to be confident that
                        practical progress can be made. But only if:</p>
                    <p>• We and the other industrial countries recognize that we share a common
                        destiny with the developing world;</p>
                    <p>• They, the developing nations, recognize their responsibilities both within
                        the international system and for equity as well as growth in their own
                        societies; and</p>
                    <p>• All of us, together, recognize the wisdom of a great man the world has now
                        lost—Jean Monnet.<note n="20" xml:id="d115fn20">Monnet died in

                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Jimmy Carter</persName> took part in
                        an interview with editors and news directors, consisting of his introductory
                        remarks and a question-and-answer session, at the White House on April 7,
                        1979. The session began at 1:16 p.m. in the Cabinet Room. In response to a
                        question concerning the global perception of the administration’s human
                        rights policy, the President commented:</p>
                    <p>“Well, there have been a number of occasions around the world where our human
                        rights policy, which I espouse very strongly and think we ought to maintain,
                        has been a diplomatic problem—in dealing with the People’s Republic of
                        China, the Soviet Union, South Korea, Argentina, Chile, Brazil, the
                        Philippines—just been described—and other countries. I could name a lot of
                        them.</p>
                    <p>“Q. Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>“The President. Afghanistan and others. I acknowledge that. I think, in
                        balance, it’s one of the best things that we have ever done since I’ve been
                        President. I think for us to raise the banner of being deeply committed to
                        human rights has been and has had an enlightening effect on the rest of the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>“Some of the administrations or the regimes in other nations have been
                        embarrassed. But I can assure you—and I don’t think I’m saying this in a
                        gloating way—that in previous administrations, quite often—even in very
                        popular administrations—when visits were made to countries, say, in Latin
                        America just to use an example, there have been, sometimes, massive
                        anti-American demonstrations against very pop<pb n="589" facs="0630"
                            xml:id="pg_589"/>ular leaders, like <persName corresp="#p_EDD_1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName>
                        or <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> or <persName
                            corresp="#p_RJD_1">Rockefeller</persName> and others.</p>
                    <p>“When we have visited those countries, the response has been overwhelmingly
                        favorable and friendly among the people, even when I drove through the
                        streets of Rio de Janeiro in the midst of an argument where human rights and
                        nuclear power were raised.</p>
                    <p>“I think the people have responded well, even though the leaders in some
                        countries have been somewhat embarrassed.</p>
                    <p>“I think it’s also reminded the American people about our own Nation’s
                        principles. And sometimes the arguments with the totalitarian regime that
                        has several thousands of people imprisoned without trial and without any
                        charge, those arguments have made vivid in the minds of Americans that we
                        are indeed better, or different—I think better—in our basic philosophy than
                        those philosophies espoused in some other countries.</p>
                    <p>“There has been a substantial shift toward democratization in many of those
                        nations, partially encouraged by our own standards on human rights. And
                        there have been literally tens of thousands of political prisoners released
                        from within those countries in the last year and a half or so because of our
                        human rights position.</p>
                    <p>“The last point that I would like to make in this answer is that it’s raised
                        the issue of human rights to a high degree of intensity. There are very few
                        leaders in the world, in the 150 countries that now exist, who don’t every
                        day or every week have to remind ourselves—including me—to what degree are
                        we violating basic human rights? To what degree are we earning the
                        condemnation of the rest of the world? To what degree are we arousing the
                        animosity or distrust or displeasure or disappointment among our own people
                        because we violate those rights?</p>
                    <p>“I’m very proud of what we have done. And I think in balance, this posture on
                        human rights has helped us considerably.</p>
                    <p>“If you would go back 3 years or so and look at the attitude, for instance,
                        in the General Assembly of the United Nations every fall when it convened,
                        where our Nation was the butt of every joke and the target of every attack
                        mounted by almost 100 nations on Earth, and compare it with the difference
                        now, the last 2 years, part of that improvement is because we have espoused
                        basic human rights.</p>
                    <p>“I think this is particularly true in Africa where black people now feel
                        they’ve got a friend in the United States; they can depend on us.</p>
                    <p>“So, to answer your question, I think we’ve got the right policy, and I
                        intend not only to maintain it but to elevate our commitment to that
                        principle.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"

                    <p>I want, first of all, to commend and to endorse the theme of this convention:
                        the defense of the first amendment of our Constitution and the freedom of
                        the press.</p>
                    <p>Liberty of expression is our most important civil right, and freedom of the
                        press is its most important bulwark. We can never afford to grow complacent
                        about the first amendment; on the contrary, you and I and others must
                        actively protect it always.</p>
                    <p>The American press has grown enormously since the Nation’s early days—not
                        only in its size and breadth but in its concepts of its own duties and its
                        own responsibilities. The highest of these duties is to inform the public on
                        the important issues of the day. And no issue is more important than the one
                        I want to discuss with you today in a solemn and somber and sincere way—the
                        control of nuclear arms.</p>
                    <p>Each generation of Americans faces a choice that defines our national
                        character, a choice that is also important for what it says about our own
                        Nation’s outlook toward the world.</p>
                    <p>In the coming months, we will almost certainly be faced with such a
                        choice—whether to accept or to reject a new strategic arms limitation
                        treaty. The decision we make will profoundly affect our lives and the lives
                        of people all over the world for years to come. We face this choice from a
                        position of strength, as the strongest nation on Earth economically,
                        militarily, and politically.</p>
                    <p>Our alliances are firm and reliable. Our military forces are strong and
                        ready. Our economic power is unmatched. Along with other industrial
                        democracies who are our friends, we lead the way in technological
                        innovation. Our combined economies are more than three times as productive
                        as those of the Soviet Union and all its allies. Our political institutions
                        are based on human freedom. Our open system encourages individual initiative
                        and creativity, and that, in turn, strengthens our entire society. Our
                        values and our democratic way of life have a magnetic appeal for people all
                        over the world which a materialistic and a totalitarian philosophy can never
                        hope to challenge or to rival.</p>

                    <p>For all these reasons, we have a capacity for leadership in the world that
                        surpasses that of any other nation. That leadership imposes many
                        responsibilities on us, on me as President, and on you, other leaders who
                        shape opinion and the character of our country.</p>
                    <p>But our noblest duty is to use our strength to serve our highest interest—the
                        building of a secure, stable, and a peaceful world. We perform that duty in
                        the spirit proclaimed by <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">John F.

                    </p>
                    <p>In our relations with the Soviet Union, the possibility of mutual
                        annihilation makes a strategy of peace the only rational choice for both
                        sides.</p>
                    <p>Because our values are so different, it is clear that the United States of
                        America and the Soviet Union will be in competition as far ahead as we can
                        imagine or see. Yet we have a common interest in survival, and we share a
                        common recognition that our survival depends, in a real sense, on each
                        other. The very competition between us makes it imperative that we bring
                        under control its most dangerous aspect—the nuclear arms race. That is why
                        the strategic arms limitation talks are so very important. This effort by
                        two great nations to limit vital security forces is unique in human history;
                        none have ever done this before.</p>
                    <p>As the Congress and the American people consider the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> treaty, which is now nearly complete,
                        the debate will center around four basic questions: Why do we need <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>? How is the treaty related to our
                        overall defense strategy? Can Soviet compliance be verified? How does the
                        treaty relate to Soviet activities which challenge us and challenge our
                        interests?</p>
                    <p>Let me address each question in turn.</p>
                    <p>First, why do we need a strategic arms limitation treaty? We need it because
                        it will contribute to a more peaceful world—and to our own national
                        security.</p>
                    <p>Today, we and the Soviet Union, with sharply different world outlooks and
                        interests, both have the ominous destructive power literally to destroy each
                        other as a functioning society, killing tens of millions of people in the
                        process. And common sense tells us—as it tells the Soviet Union—that we must
                        work to make our competition less dangerous, less burdensome, and less
                        likely to bring the ultimate horror of nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, the entire world has a vital interest in whether or not we control
                        the strategic arms race. We have consulted closely with our <pb n="592"
                            facs="0633" xml:id="pg_592"/>allies, who count on us not only to
                        maintain strong military forces to offset Soviet military power, but also,
                        and equally important, to manage successfully a stable East-West
                        relationship. <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> is at the heart of both
                        these crucial efforts. That is why the leaders of France and Great Britain,
                        Germany, England, Canada, and other nations have voiced their full support
                        for the emerging treaty.</p>
                    <p>Some nations which have so far held back from building their own nuclear
                        weapons—and at least a dozen other nations on Earth now have that
                        capability—will be strongly influenced in their decision by whether the two
                        nuclear superpowers will restrain our weapons. Rejection of the new
                        strategic arms limitation treaty would seriously undermine the effort to
                        control proliferation of these deadly weapons. And nothing, nothing, would
                        more surely damage our other critical efforts in arms control—from a ban on
                        all nuclear testing to the prevention of dangerous satellite warfare in
                        space; from equalizing <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and Warsaw
                        Pact forces to restraining the spread of sophisticated conventional weapons
                        on Earth.</p>
                    <p>Every President since the dawn of the nuclear age has pursued the effort to
                        bring nuclear arms under control. And this must be a continuing process.</p>

                        efforts of Presidents <persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName> and

                        agreement with the Soviet Union in 1963 to stop the poisonous testing of

                    <p>Three Presidents have now spent more than 6 years negotiating the next step
                        in this process—<gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. We have all
                        negotiated carefully and deliberately. Every step of the way, we’ve worked
                        with our military leaders and other experts, and we’ve sought the advice and
                        counsel of the Members of Congress.</p>
                    <p>An overwhelming majority of the American people recognize the need for <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. Our people want and our people
                        expect continued, step-by-step progress toward bringing nuclear weapons
                        under control.</p>
                    <p>Americans will support a reasoned increase in our defense effort, but we do
                        not want a wholly unnecessary return to the Cold War and an all-out arms
                        race, with its vastly greater risks and costs. Through strength, we want
                        world peace.</p>
                    <p>Let me turn to the second question—how is <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> II related to our overall defense strategy?</p>
                    <p>The strategic forces of the United States and the Soviet Union today are
                        essentially equivalent. They have larger and more numerous land-based
                        missiles. We have a larger number of warheads and, as you know, significant
                        technological and geographical advantages.</p>
                    <p>Each side has the will and the means to prevent the other from achieving
                        superiority. Neither side is in a position to exploit its nuclear weapons
                        for political purposes, nor to use strategic weapons without facing almost
                        certain suicide.</p>
                    <p>What causes us concern is not the current balance but the momentum of the
                        Soviet strategic buildup. Over the past decade, the Soviets have steadily
                        increased their real defense spending, year by year, while our own defense
                        spending over that decade has had a net decrease.</p>
                    <p>In areas not limited by <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I, they have launched ambitious programs
                        to strengthen their strategic forces. At some future point, the Soviet Union
                        could achieve a strategic advantage, unless we alter these trends. That is
                        exactly what I want to do—with the support of the American people and the
                        bipartisan support of Congress.</p>
                    <p>We must move on two fronts at the same time. First, within mutually accepted
                        limits, we must modernize our own strategic forces. Along with the
                        strengthening of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, that is a central
                        purpose of the increased defense budget that I’ve submitted to
                        Congress—improvements which are necessary even in a time of fiscal
                        restraint. And second, we must place more stringent limits on the arms race
                        than are presently imposed by <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I. That
                        is the purpose of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II treaty.</p>
                    <p>The defense budget I’ve submitted will ensure that our nuclear force
                        continues to be essentially equivalent to that of the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>This year, we’ve begun to equip our submarines with new, more powerful, and
                        longer range Trident I missiles. Next year, the first of our <pb n="594"
                            facs="0635" xml:id="pg_594"/>new, even more secure Trident submarines
                        will be going to sea, and we are working on a more powerful and accurate
                            <gloss target="#t_Trident2_1">Trident II</gloss> missile for these
                        submarines.</p>
                    <p>Our cruise missile program will greatly enhance the effectiveness of our
                        long-range bomber force. These missiles will be able to penetrate any air
                        defense system which the Soviet Union could build in the foreseeable
                        future.</p>
                    <p>We are substantially improving the accuracy and the power of our land-based
                        Minuteman missiles. But in the coming decade missiles of this type, based in
                        fixed silos, will become increasingly vulnerable to surprise attack. The
                        Soviets have three-quarters of their warheads in such fixed-based missiles,
                        compared to only one-quarter of ours. Nevertheless, this is a very serious
                        problem, and we must deal with it effectively and sensibly.</p>
                    <p>The Defense Department now has under consideration a number of options for
                        responding to this problem, including making some of our own <gloss
                            target="#t_ICBM_1">ICBM</gloss>’s mobile. I might add—and this is very
                        important—that the options which we are evaluating would be far more
                        costly—and we would have far less confidence of their effectiveness—in the
                        absence of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II limits. For without
                        these limits on the number of Soviet warheads, the Soviet Union could
                        counter any effort we made simply by greatly increasing the number of
                        warheads on their missiles.</p>
                    <p>Let me emphasize that the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II agreement
                        preserves adequate flexibility for the United States in this important
                        area.</p>
                    <p>Our strategic forces must be able to survive any attack and to counterattack
                        military and civilian targets in the aggressor nation. And the aggressor
                        nation must know that we have the ability and the will to exercise this
                        option if they should attack us. We have had this capability—which is the
                        essence of deterrence—in the past; we have it today; and <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, plus the defense programs that I’ve
                        described, will ensure that we have it for the future.</p>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II agreement will slow the growth
                        of Soviet arms and limit the strategic competition, and by helping to define
                        future threats that we might face, <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II
                        will make our defense planning much more effective.</p>
                    <p>Under the agreement, the two sides will be limited to equal numbers of
                        strategic launchers for the first time, ending the substantial Soviet
                        numerical advantage which was permitted in the currently effective <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I treaty.</p>
                    <p>To reach these new and lower levels, the Soviets will have to reduce their
                        overall number of strategic delivery systems by 10 percent—more than 250
                        Soviet missile launchers or bombers will have to be dismantled. Naturally,
                        the Soviets will choose to phase out their older systems, but these systems
                        are still formidable.</p>
                    <pb n="595" facs="0636" xml:id="pg_595"/>
                    <p>The missiles, for instance, to be torn down are comparable in age and payload
                        to our Minuteman II missiles and to our Polaris missiles, presently
                        deployed. Under the agreement, they will not be permitted to replace these
                        dismantled systems with modern ones. Our own operational forces have been
                        kept somewhat below the permitted ceiling. Thus, under the agreement, we
                        could increase our force level, if necessary.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II will also impose the first limited
                        but important restraints on the race to build new systems and to improve
                        existing ones—the so-called qualitative arms race.</p>
                    <p>In short, <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II places serious limits on
                        what the Soviets might do in the absence of such an agreement. For example,
                        without <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, the Soviet Union could
                        build up to some 3,000 strategic systems by 1985. With <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, we will both be limited to 2,250
                        such weapons.</p>
                    <p>This new arms control agreement will, obviously, serve our national
                        interests. It will reduce the dangerous levels of strategic arms and
                        restrain the development of future weapons. It will help to maintain our
                        relative strength compared to the Soviets. It will avert a costly, risky,
                        and pointless buildup of missile launchers and bombers—at the end of which
                        both sides would be even less secure.</p>
                    <p>Let me turn now to the third of the four questions—how can we know whether
                        the Soviets are living up to their obligations under this <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement?</p>
                    <p>No objective—no objective—has commanded more energy and attention in our
                        negotiations. We have insisted that the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> II agreement be made verifiable. We are confident that no
                        significant violation of the treaty could take place without the United
                        States detecting it.</p>
                    <p>Our confidence in the verifiability of their agreement derives from the size
                        and the nature of activities we must monitor and the many effective and
                        sophisticated intelligence collection systems which we in America
                        possess.</p>
                    <p>For example, nuclear submarines take several years to construct and assemble.
                        Missile silos and their supporting equipment are large and quite visible.
                        Intercontinental bombers are built at a few plants, and they need major
                        airfields. Our photoreconnaissance satellites survey the entire Soviet Union
                        on a regular basis, and they give us high confidence that we will be able to
                        count accurately the numbers of all these systems.</p>
                    <p>But our independent verification capabilities are not limited only to
                        observing these large-scale activities. We can determine not only how many
                        systems there are, but what they can do. Our photographic satellites and
                        other systems enable us to follow technological developments in Soviet
                        strategic forces with great accuracy. There is no ques<pb n="596"
                            facs="0637" xml:id="pg_596"/>tion that any cheating which might affect
                        our national security would be discovered in time for us to respond
                        fully.</p>
                    <p>For many years, we have monitored Soviet strategic forces and Soviet
                        compliance with the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreements with a
                        high degree of confidence. The overall capability remains. It was certainly
                        not lost with our observation stations in Iran, which was only one of many
                        intelligence sources that we use to follow Soviet strategic activities. We
                        are concerned with that loss, but we must keep it in perspective.</p>
                    <p>This monitoring capability relates principally to the portion of the new
                        agreement dealing with the modernization limits on <gloss target="#t_ICBM_1"
                            >ICBM</gloss>’s and to only a portion of such modernization
                        restraints.</p>
                    <p>The sensitive intelligence techniques obviously cannot be disclosed in
                        public, but the bottom line is that if there is an effort to cheat on the
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement, including the limits
                        on modernizing <gloss target="#t_ICBM_1">ICBM</gloss>’s, we will detect it,
                        and we will do so in time fully to protect our security.</p>
                    <p>And we must also keep in mind that quite apart from <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> limits, our security is affected by the extent of our
                        information about Soviet strategic forces. With this <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II treaty, that vital information will
                        be much more accessible to us.</p>
                    <p>The agreement specifically forbids, for the first time, interference with the
                        systems used for monitoring compliance and prohibits any deliberate
                        concealment that would impede verification. Any such concealment activity
                        would itself be detectable, and a violation of this part of the agreement
                        would be so serious as to give us grounds to cancel the treaty itself.</p>
                    <p>As I have said many times, the stakes are too high to rely on trust, or even
                        on the Soviets’ rational inclination to act in their own best interest. The
                        treaty must—and the treaty will be—verifiable from the first day it is
                        signed.</p>
                    <p>And finally, how does <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II fit into the
                        context of our overall relations with the Soviet Union?</p>
                    <p>Because <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II will make the world safer
                        and our own Nation more secure, it is in our national interest to control
                        nuclear weapons even as we compete with the Soviets elsewhere in the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>A <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II agreement in no way limits our
                        ability to promote our interests or to answer Soviet threats to those
                        interests. We will continue to support the independence of Third World
                        nations who struggle to stay free. We will continue to promote the peaceful
                        resolution of local and regional disputes and to oppose efforts by any
                        others to inflame these disputes with outside force. And we will continue to
                        work for human rights.</p>
                    <p>It’s a delusion to believe that rejection of a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> treaty would somehow induce the Soviet Union to exercise
                        new restraints in trou<pb n="597" facs="0638" xml:id="pg_597"/>bled areas.
                        The actual effect of rejecting such a treaty might be precisely the
                        opposite. The most intransient and hostile elements of a Soviet political
                        power structure would certainly be encouraged and strengthened by our
                        rejection of a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement. The Soviets
                        might very well feel that they then have little to lose by creating new
                        international tensions.</p>
                    <p>A rejection of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II would have
                        significance far beyond the fate of a single treaty. It would mean a radical
                        turning away from America’s longtime policy of seeking world peace. We would
                        no longer be identified as the peace-loving nation. It would turn us away
                        from the control of nuclear weapons and from the easing of tensions between
                        Americans and the Soviet people under the system of international law based
                        on mutual interests.</p>
                    <p>The rejection of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II would result in a
                        more perilous world. As I said at Georgia Tech on February 20, “Each crisis,
                        each confrontation, each point of friction—as serious as it may be in its
                        own right—would take on an added measure of significance and an added
                        dimension of danger. For it would occur in an atmosphere of unbridled
                        strategic competition and deteriorating strategic stability. It is precisely
                        because we have fundamental differences with the Soviet Union that we are
                        determined to bring this most dangerous element of our military competition
                        under control.”<note n="8" xml:id="d117fn8">See <ref target="#d111">Document
                                111</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>For these reasons, we will not try to impose binding linkage between Soviet
                        behavior and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, and we will not accept
                        any Soviet attempts to link <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> with
                        aspects of our own foreign policy of which they may disapprove.</p>
                    <p>Again, <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II is not a favor we are doing
                        for the Soviet Union; it’s an agreement carefully negotiated in the national
                        security interests of the United States of America.</p>
                    <p>I put these issues to you today, because they need discussion and debate and
                        because the voices of the American people must be heard.</p>
                    <p>In the months ahead, we will do all in our power to explain the treaty
                        clearly and fully to the American people. I know that Members of Congress
                        from both parties will join in this effort to ensure an informed public
                        debate. And you, more than any other group I can imagine in the United
                        States, share this responsibility with me and with the Congress.</p>
                    <p>During this debate, it’s important that we exercise care. We will be sharing
                        with the Congress some of our most sensitive defense and intelligence
                        secrets. And the leaders in Congress must ensure that these secrets will be
                        guarded so that the debate itself will not undermine our own security.</p>
                    <pb n="598" facs="0639" xml:id="pg_598"/>
                    <p>As the national discussion takes place, let us be clear about what the issues
                        are—and are not.</p>
                    <p>Americans are committed to maintaining a strong defense. That is not the
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>We will continue to compete, and compete effectively, with the Soviet Union.
                        That is not the issue.</p>
                    <p>The issue is whether we will move ahead with strategic arms control or resume
                        a relentless nuclear weapons competition. That’s the choice we face—between
                        an imperfect world with a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreement,
                        or an imperfect and more dangerous world without a <gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        </gloss> agreement.</p>
                    <p>With <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, we will have significant
                        reductions in Soviet strategic forces; far greater certainty in our defense
                        planning and in the knowledge of the threats that we might face; flexibility
                        to meet our own defense needs; the foundation for further controls on
                        nuclear and conventional arms; and our own self-respect and the earned
                        respect of the world for a United States demonstrably committed to the works
                        of peace.</p>
                    <p>Without <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, the Soviets will be
                        unconstrained and capable, and probably committed to an enormous further
                        buildup.</p>
                    <p>Without <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, there would have to be a much
                        sharper rise in our own defense spending, at the expense of other necessary
                        programs for our people.</p>
                    <p>Without <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, we would end up with
                        thousands more strategic nuclear warheads on both sides, with far greater
                        costs—and far less security—for our citizens.</p>
                    <p>Without <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, we would see improved
                        relations with the Soviet Union replaced by heightened tensions.</p>
                    <p>Without <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, the long, slow process of
                        arms control, so central to building a safer world, would be dealt a
                        crippling and, perhaps, a fatal blow.</p>
                    <p>Without <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, the world would be forced to
                        conclude that America had chosen confrontation rather than cooperation and
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>This is an inescapable choice we face. For the fact is that the alternative
                        to this treaty is not some perfect agreement, drafted unilaterally by the
                        United States in which we gain everything and the Soviets gain nothing; the
                        alternative now, and in the foreseeable future, is no agreement at all.</p>
                    <p>I am convinced that the United States has a moral and a political will to
                        control the relentless technology which could constantly devise new and more
                        destructive weapons to kill human beings. We need not drift into a dark
                        nightmare of unrestrained arms competition. We Americans have the wisdom to
                        know that our security depends on more than just maintaining our unsurpassed
                        defense forces. Our secu<pb n="599" facs="0640" xml:id="pg_599"/>rity and
                        that of our allies also depends on the strength of ideas and ideals and on
                        arms control measures that can stabilize and finally reverse a dangerous and
                        a wasteful arms race which neither side can win. This is a path of wisdom.
                        This is a path of peace.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Meeting the Challenges of a Changing World</p>
                    <p>From the first days of our nation; Americans have held a staunch optimism
                        about the future. We have been a self-confident people, certain about our
                        ability to shape our destiny. And we are a people who have not only adapted
                        well to change, we have thrived on it.</p>
                    <p>We are now living in a period of history marked by deep and rapid change.
                        Tonight, I want to talk about change and how America can use its
                        extraordinary strength to meet the challenges of a changing world.</p>
                    <p>America’s optimism has been jarred in recent years—by a bitter war, by
                        domestic divisions that tested our democratic institutions and left many of
                        our people skeptical about government, by the sudden awareness that our
                        economic life at home can be shaped by actions abroad, and by the
                        realization that there are events which affect us but which we can only
                        partly influence.</p>
                    <p>There is much that we can and have learned from these experiences. But fear
                        of the future is not one of them.</p>
                    <p>Let me share with you frankly my concern that the distorted proposition being
                        advanced by some that America is in a period of decline in the world is not
                        only wrong as a matter of fact but dangerous as a basis for policy.</p>
                    <p>For we would imperil our future if we lost confidence in ourselves and in our
                        strength and retreated from energetic leadership in the world. And we would
                        imperil our future, as well, if we reacted in frustration and used our power
                        to resist change in the world or employed our military power when it would
                        do more harm than good.</p>
                    <pb n="600" facs="0641" xml:id="pg_600"/>
                    <p>The realization that we are not omnipotent should not make us fear we have
                        lost our power or the will to use it. If we appreciate the extraordinary
                        strengths we have, if we understand the nature of the changes taking place
                        in the world, and if we act effectively to use our different kinds of power
                        to shape different kinds of change, we have every reason to be confident
                        about our future.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">America’s Strengths</p>
                    <p>We must begin with a clear understanding of our own strengths as a
                        nation.</p>
                    <p>America’s military strength today is formidable. I know of no responsible
                        military official who would exchange our strategic position for that of any
                        other nation.</p>
                    <p>• We have friendly neighbors on our borders.</p>
                    <p>• We have strong and reliable security relationships. Together, these allies
                        more than double our overall military strength.</p>
                    <p>• We have easy access to the sea, which enables us to have diversified
                        strategic forces and the ready capacity to project our power.</p>
                    <p>Our economy, and those of our allies, are more than three times as productive
                        as those of the Soviets and their allies.</p>
                    <p>The industrial democracies continue to lead the way in technological
                        innovation and in harnessing that technology to serve mankind.</p>
                    <p>And the way of life of our people and what we stand for as a nation continue
                        to have magnetic appeal around the world.</p>
                    <p>Because we and our allies are the engines of creative change in almost every
                        field, because of the vitality of our political institutions and the
                        strength of our military forces, we have a capacity for leadership—and an
                        ability to thrive in a world of change—that is unsurpassed.</p>
                    <p>The issue is not whether we are strong. We are. The challenge is to use these
                        unquestioned strengths appropriately and effectively to advance our
                        interests in a world undergoing different kinds of change.</p>
                    <p>What are these changes, and how can we use our strength effectively?</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Stable Strategic Equivalence</p>
                    <p>The first element of change is the evolution from an earlier period of
                        American strategic supremacy to an era of stable strategic equivalence.</p>
                    <p>We should harbor no illusion that we could return to the earlier era. Neither
                        side will permit the other to hold an exploitable strategic advantage. Each
                        side has the financial and technical resources to keep pace with the other.
                        With the stakes so high, we know that both of us will do whatever is
                        necessary to keep from falling behind. That is why essential equivalence has
                        become the only realistic strategy in today’s nuclear world.</p>
                    <pb n="601" facs="0642" xml:id="pg_601"/>
                    <p>This rough balance can also serve the cause of stability—even if some find it
                        unsettling compared with our earlier supremacy. It is this essential
                        equivalence in strategic arms which allows us to move ahead on arms
                        limitation. For if one side were far ahead, it would feel no special urgency
                        about arms control, and the side that was behind would refuse to negotiate
                        from a position of weakness. Only when both sides perceive a balance, as is
                        now the case, can we hope for real arms control progress.</p>
                    <p>Our response to this broad change in the security environment has several
                        elements.</p>
                    <p>We will assure that essential equivalence in nuclear arms is maintained. We
                        will not be overtaken by the momentum of Soviet military programs.</p>
                    <p>We have undertaken a far-reaching modernization of our strategic forces. We
                        are improving each leg of our strategic triad—with cruise missiles for our
                            <gloss target="#t_B52_1">B–52</gloss> bombers, with a new Trident I
                        missile for existing submarines and the development of a new Trident
                        submarine and <gloss target="#t_Trident2_1">Trident II</gloss> missile, and
                        with development funding for the <gloss target="#t_MX_1">M–X</gloss>
                        missile. And we are examining, in a timely fashion, the options for
                        offsetting the probable future threat to the land-based portion of our
                        missile force.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, we are equally determined to enhance our security by
                        applying mutual limits to nuclear arms. We are at the threshold of a <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II treaty. It is a critical step in the
                        process of bringing strategic weapons under sensible control. As its terms
                        become known and debated, I am confident that the Senate will agree that it
                        will enhance our national security and that of our allies. Its rejection
                        would lead to an intensification of the nuclear arms race. The risk of
                        nuclear war would increase. The costs to our taxpayers would rise sharply.
                        It would heighten tensions with the Soviets, trouble our allies, and deal a
                        crippling blow to future arms control prospects.</p>
                    <p>The American people, and our allies, understand the importance of decreasing
                        tensions with the Soviet Union and seeking common ground where our interests
                        may converge.</p>
                    <p>While we address strategic issues, we must also be especially sensitive to
                        the importance of maintaining a balance of conventional forces. At the
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> summit last summer, we and our
                        allies committed ourselves to real increases of 3% in defense expenditures
                        and to modernize and upgrade <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>

                    <p>In Europe and elsewhere, we are committed to maintain strong conventional
                        forces. And no one should doubt that we will use those forces if our vital
                        interests or those of our allies are threatened.</p>
                    <p>In these ways, we will maintain, and strengthen, our security in an age of
                        essential equivalence by meeting the new problems it presents and by seizing
                        the new arms control opportunities it affords.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Growing Risks of Regional Conflicts</p>
                    <p>A second change is the reality that the risks posed by regional conflicts
                        have grown. Many of these conflicts are long standing. They have roots deep
                        in history, in geography, in religious and ethnic differences.</p>
                    <p>But as more nations acquire more sophisticated arms, regional conflicts
                        become more dangerous. They pose a constant threat of wider confrontation.
                        As a result, the United States must be more active in working to help settle
                        these disputes peacefully.</p>
                    <p>The fact is that no nation is more intensively engaged in the continuing
                        effort to dampen the flames of conflict around the world than the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>No other nation could have played the role that the United States has played
                        in helping Israel and Egypt achieve an historic peace treaty.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d118fn4">Reference is to the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty,
                            signed at Washington on March 26, 1979. For the text of the treaty, see

                            3–15.</note> And we will continue to remain actively involved in the
                        effort to achieve a comprehensive peace—a peace in which Israel, the
                        neighboring Arab states, and the Palestinian people can live with security
                        and with dignity.</p>
                    <p>In southern Africa, in the eastern Mediterranean, in Southeast Asia, and
                        elsewhere in the world, we are using the influence we have for peace.
                        Progress does not come easily or quickly. There will be setbacks, for the
                        path to peace is often more difficult than the road to war. But with
                        persistence and steadiness, we <hi rend="italic">can</hi> help provide the
                        parties to conflict with an alternative to violence—if they choose to take
                        it.</p>
                    <p>In some cases, these efforts will involve working with other interested
                        nations as a catalyst for bringing the parties together. In other
                        situations, we will support international and regional institutions that
                        provide a framework for easing tensions. When we believe it will con<pb
                            n="603" facs="0644" xml:id="pg_603"/>tribute to regional stability, we
                        will assist nations threatened by external force to strengthen their ability
                        to defend themselves.</p>
                    <p>In all cases, we will oppose attempts by others to transform local disputes
                        into international tests of will. Every nation has a responsibility to
                        recognize that there is greater safety in healing, rather than fueling,
                        local conflicts.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Changes Within Nations</p>
                    <p>A third kind of change we must address is change <hi rend="italic"
                            >within</hi> nations.</p>
                    <p>As a result of mass communications, better education, urbanization, and
                        growing expectations for a better life, there is a new tide in many Third
                        World nations, as more and more people demand a fuller share in their
                        government and their economy. These demands can place extraordinary
                        pressures on economic, social, and political institutions.</p>
                    <p>This ferment can at times cause the kind of turmoil that adversely affects
                        our interests, at least in the short run. But rather than reacting in
                        opposition to such change, or assuming that it necessarily works against us,
                        let us look at two central questions: Is this kind of change generally in
                        the interest of our nation? And what are the best instruments through which
                        we can help others meet popular aspirations in an orderly and peaceful
                        fashion?</p>
                    <p>The answer to the first question, in my judgment, is that the growing demand
                        of individuals around the world for the fulfillment of their political,
                        social, and economic rights <hi rend="italic">is</hi> generally in our
                        interest. These aspirations are producing new or strengthened democratic
                        institutions in many nations throughout the world. And America can flourish
                        best in a world where freedom flourishes.</p>
                    <p>Should we not gain confidence from this expansion of democracy, which is
                        taking place not because we force it but because of its inherent appeal?</p>
                    <p>And what is that inherent appeal? Surely it lies in the enhanced opportunity
                        that democracy provides for the realization of fundamental human rights—the
                        rights to political and religious expression, to political participation,
                        and to economic justice.</p>
                    <p>These values are remarkably attuned to the demands of change. The change
                        which confronts many nations—particularly the less developed
                        nations—challenges cultures, ways of living and communicating, notions of
                        individual and national autonomy. The great strength of democratic processes
                        is their flexibility and resilience. They allow accommodation and
                        compromise. By giving all groups a voice in the decisions which affect their
                        lives, democratic societies are far better able to shape a peaceful and
                        stable balance between tradition and progress.</p>

                    <p>Internal change in other countries will sometimes be turbulent and difficult.
                        At times, it may run in repressive directions. But we must not let our
                        concerns about the crosscurrents blind us to the tide running in favor of
                        freedom.</p>
                    <p>In seeking to help others meet the legitimate demands of their peoples, what
                        are the best instruments at hand?</p>
                    <p>Let me state first that the use of military force is not, and should not be,
                        a desirable American policy response to the internal politics of other
                        nations. We believe we have the right to shape our destiny; we must respect
                        that right in others. We must clearly understand the distinction between our
                        readiness to act forcefully when the vital interests of our nation, our
                        allies, and our friends are threatened and our recognition that our military
                        forces cannot provide a satisfactory answer to the purely <hi rend="italic"
                            >internal</hi> problems of other nations.</p>
                    <p>In helping other nations cope with such internal change, our challenge is to
                        help them develop their own institutions, strengthen their own economies,
                        and foster the ties between government and people.</p>
                    <p>To do so, we must continue to provide them with increasing levels of
                        development assistance. We must maintain human rights policies which work in
                        practical ways to advance freedom. And we must accept the fact that other
                        societies will manage change and build new institutions in patterns that may
                        be different from our own.</p>
                    <p>Third World nations will fiercely defend their independence. They will reject
                        efforts by outsiders to impose their institutions. We should welcome this
                        spirit. For our national interest is not in their becoming like us; it is
                        that they be free of domination by others.</p>
                    <p>This strategy of affirmative involvement and support for the independence and
                        the diversity of developing nations serves us well. It capitalizes on the
                        West’s inherent strengths. And it improves our ties to developing countries
                        in a context which does not force them to make an explicit choice between
                        East and West.</p>
                    <p>The test of our will in dealing with domestic change abroad will come not in
                        how we use our military might but in whether we are willing to put our
                        resources behind our words—and to make them work effectively.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">An Increasingly Pluralistic World</p>
                    <p>A fourth kind of change that we are seeing is in the international system
                        itself. Building on our experience as a pluralistic nation, we must learn to
                        deal effectively with an increasingly pluralistic world.</p>
                    <p>Since the early 1960’s, we have seen the emergence of dozens of new nations,
                        each with its distinctive identity, each fiercely intent on fulfilling its
                        national aspirations.</p>
                    <pb n="605" facs="0646" xml:id="pg_605"/>
                    <p>We have seen the development of new powers in the world, nations which play
                        an increasingly important role in international economic and political
                        life.</p>
                    <p>And we have come to recognize that many of the challenges we face are
                        genuinely global in scope. Halting the spread of nuclear weapons, managing
                        the world’s resources sensibly and fairly, preserving an environment that
                        can sustain us—these problems do not derive from any single nation nor can
                        any single nation, working alone, resolve them.</p>
                    <p>A world where many must participate in designing the future rather than a
                        few, where progress often requires cooperative effort, demands more—not
                        less—American leadership. It requires us to exercise that leadership
                        creatively, to inspire others to work with us toward goals we share but
                        cannot achieve separately. It calls for a new kind of diplomacy.</p>
                    <p>We must practice, wherever possible, an inclusive form of diplomacy, working
                        together with others to achieve common goals. Such multilateral efforts are
                        time consuming and complex. But they can often be more productive than
                        working alone.</p>
                    <p>The core around which these broader efforts must be built is a strong and
                        solid relationship with our traditional allies. We have worked hard in this
                        Administration to strengthen that partnership, and we have done so.</p>
                    <p>Working together with our allies we are able, on an increasing number of
                        issues, to engage others in collective efforts to resolve some of the more
                        intractable problems we face. Let me cite just one example—our effort to
                        find a more proliferation-resistant nuclear fuel cycle.</p>
                    <p>At our initiative, 44 nations have come together to search for ways—both
                        technical and institutional—to enable nations to pursue peaceful nuclear
                        energy without adding to the danger of nuclear weapons proliferation. There
                        is no “American” answer to the threat of nuclear weapons proliferation;
                        there is only an international answer, and we are working with others to
                        find it.</p>
                    <p>We are strengthening our ties with those developing nations which exert
                        increasing economic and political influence. We have worked to bring these
                        and other developing nations more fully and fairly into the decisionmaking
                        of international institutions which affect their life and ours. For enduring
                        solutions to problems we face in common can be found only if all who have a
                        stake also have a role and recognize their responsibilities as well as their
                        rights in the world community.</p>
                    <p>To work effectively in a changing international system we must be prepared to
                        work with nations whose ideologies are different from our <pb n="606"
                            facs="0647" xml:id="pg_606"/>own. By establishing full diplomatic
                        relations with the People’s Republic of China, for example, we are now in a
                        better position to deal directly and forthrightly with a government that
                        represents one-fourth of the world’s people.</p>
                    <p>We have embarked on a deliberate effort to enhance the role of the United
                        Nations and regional institutions such as the Organization of American
                        States, the Association of South East Asian Nations, and the Organization of
                        African Unity. These institutions often can provide the most effective
                        setting for resolving international disputes and for broadening the realm of
                        international cooperation.</p>
                    <p>To secure the cooperation of other nations, we must deal with them on a basis
                        of mutual respect and independence. Our achievement of a new Panama Canal
                        treaty, which secures our use of the canal for coming generations, has
                        demonstrated that fair dealing with other nations, whatever their size, can
                        serve our interests as well as theirs. Our relations throughout this
                        hemisphere have benefited as a result.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A Changing World Economy</p>
                    <p>Let me turn finally to the change we are seeing in the international
                        economy—the growing stake every nation has in economic decisions made beyond
                        its borders.</p>
                    <p>America’s strength rests on the vitality of America’s economy. Our economy
                        continues to provide expanding opportunity for our people and continues to
                        fuel growth around the world. We must also recognize the other side of this
                        coin—the health of other economies around the world increasingly affects the
                        health of our economy.</p>
                    <p>Our exports provide Americans with jobs—in fact, one out of every eight jobs
                        in the manufacturing sector—and income for our firms and farmers. Every
                        third acre of our farmland produces for export. Imports from abroad provide
                        us with essential raw materials, they afford our consumers greater choice,
                        and they dampen our inflation.</p>
                    <p>This growing economic interdependence requires that our government work with
                        others to help create international conditions in which all nations can
                        thrive. We cannot seek to build our own economic future at the expense of
                        others, nor will we allow others to compete unfairly. For a new era of
                        economic nationalism could have tragic consequences, just as it did during
                        the protectionist warfare of the 1930’s.</p>
                    <p>We are deeply involved in working with other nations to meet the challenges
                        of a changing world economic order.</p>
                    <p>We have been successful in strengthening economic cooperation among the
                        industrial nations. We have instituted regular economic summits to
                        coordinate our economic policies so that they reinforce rather than
                        undermine one another. And there has been far closer col<pb n="607"

                        in restoring order to foreign exchange markets.</p>
                    <p>We have initialed an important new multilateral trade agreement that will
                        establish fair trading rules for the next decade.<note n="5"

                    <p>We have agreed with the other industrialized members of the International
                        Energy Agency to cut back our collective demand for oil by 2 million barrels
                        a day. To fulfill this commitment—and to reduce our own costly and dangerous
                        dependence on oil imports—the President has initiated a sensible program for
                        achieving greater domestic conservation and production. For we must begin to
                        deal urgently with a markedly changed global energy environment.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that a well-managed foreign assistance program contributes to
                        the economic performance of the developing countries. Their growth has
                        become an increasingly important factor in the health of our own economy.
                        Aiding that development is not only an investment in the future of others,
                        it is an investment in our own future as well.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Path We Will Follow</p>
                    <p>In the foreign policy choices we are now making, we are determining the path
                        we will follow in a new era. In unsettled times, each of us has a
                        responsibility to be clear about how we would deal with the world as we find
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Most Americans now recognize that we alone cannot dictate events. This
                        recognition is not a sign of America’s decline; it is a sign of growing
                        American maturity in a complex world.</p>
                    <p>We are stronger today because we recognize the realities of our times. This
                        recognition, together with an equally clear understanding that we remain the
                        most powerful of nations, should make every American as staunchly optimistic
                        about our nation’s future as we have always been.</p>
                    <p>There can be no going back to a time when we thought there could be American
                        solutions to every problem. We must go forward into a new era of mature
                        American leadership—based on strength, not belligerence; on steadiness, not
                        impulse; on confidence, not fear.</p>
                    <p>We have every reason to be confident. For 200 years, we have prospered by
                        welcoming change and working with it, not by resisting it. We <pb n="608"

                    <p>“The national debate which we now commence is not only about this treaty. We
                        are still considering as well the inescapable realities of a nuclear

                        Without the treaty, we could also do these things, but it would be more
                        costly and less certain. None of the challenges we face would be less
                        without the treaty, and some would be considerably greater. All the
                        increases we plan in our defense <pb n="609" facs="0650" xml:id="pg_609"
                        />efforts with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> would still be needed
                        without it. But many more would be needed as well.</p>
                    <p>“I see the treaty as a valuable method of helping, along with our own
                        moderately increased programs, to meet our nation’s strategic needs, and, if
                        the Soviet Union will emphasize cooperation rather than competition, <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> will also allow a healthier state of
                        U.S.-Soviet relations.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic"

                    <p>On May 11, President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Jimmy Carter</persName>
                        took part in an interview and question-and-answer session with editors and
                        news directors. The interview began at 1:15 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the
                        White House. The President discussed the beginning of the ratification
                        process in his opening remarks:</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps more important than anything that I will address while I’m President
                        and perhaps the most important vote that the incumbent Members of the Senate
                        will ever cast is concerning the ratification of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> II.</p>
                    <p>“It’s a fair treaty, enforceable treaty, verifiable treaty, and rejection of
                        this treaty would have a devastating, adverse effect on our Nation’s
                        relationship with the Soviet Union, on our ability to deal effectively with
                        our allies, with uncommitted nations, and with the control of nuclear
                        weaponry or explosives in the future throughout the world. That’s one
                        issue.”</p>
                    <p>The President noted that the Middle East peace treaties, signed by Egyptian
                        and Israeli officials, constituted the second crucial international issue
                        facing the United States. He continued:</p>
                    <p>“We hope that the other nations in that region will soon realize the
                        importance of these treaties. We’ll do all we can to implement them fully
                        and to demonstrate to all those who are interested that we believe in and
                        are committed to a comprehensive peace settlement.”</p>
                    <p>During the question-and-answer portion of the interview, a reporter asked the
                        President for his assessment of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        treaty and whether or not he could guide the treaty through the Senate in
                        the same form in which he intended to sign it. The President responded:</p>
                    <p>“Well, you know, we’ve negotiated this <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        treaty now for going on 7 years, under three Presidents, and it’s been
                        negotiated in the most extreme specificity, much greater specific, detailed
                        negotiation than ever existed with the limited test ban or <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I or the <gloss target="#t_ABM_1"
                            >ABM</gloss> treaty.</p>
                    <p>“There’s been a hard negotiation, a tough negotiation on both sides, and the
                        Soviets, I think, as have we, have been not only tough but fair. We have
                        gotten the best deal we can. It’s not perfect. I could have written a
                        unilateral treaty if I didn’t have to consult with the Soviets, that it
                        would have been more attractive to us and less attractive to them. But for
                        the Senate to expect the Soviets substantially to change <pb n="610"
                            facs="0651" xml:id="pg_610"/>their posture just because we unilaterally
                        want them to do so is fruitless and, I think, would cause a rejection of
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> treaty completely.</p>
                    <p>“I think the treaty is to our great advantage and also to the Soviets’ great
                        advantage. And I need not go into all the details of <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, but I think that it’s, at the very
                        least, very fair, well-balanced, stable, verifiable, adequate, and a move in
                        the right direction. It leads to <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> III,
                        which will be even better.</p>
                    <p>“Rejection of the treaty, however, will have the most devastating
                        consequences to our country and, I think, to world peace. It will sever, to
                        a substantial degree, the workable relationship between ourselves and the
                        Soviets. It will shake the confidence of our own <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> Allies in our ability to get along reasonably well with
                        the Soviets and leave them in an increasingly vulnerable position. It would
                        make it almost impossible for us to pursue successfully the control of
                        nuclear weapon development in countries like India, Pakistan, Iraq,
                        Argentina, Brazil, Taiwan, South Korea, and other nations who have the
                        technical ability to produce nuclear weapons, but have refrained from doing
                        so because they saw an overall, worldwide restraint.</p>
                    <p>“If we show that we are not willing to restrain our own nuclear arsenal, when
                        it’s to our advantage and the Soviets’ both to do it—we would already have
                        several thousand nuclear weapons—there’s no way that I could go to someone
                        like Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_DM_1">Desai</persName> in India,
                        with whom I have had long discussions on this, and say, ’We have set a good
                        example for you, now you restrain yourself and don’t ever develop another
                        explosion in India.’ It would be almost impossible for me to do it. So, it
                        would wipe out any real good opportunity for us to constrain nuclear
                        weaponry.</p>
                    <p>“And as you know, there are three ways that we can compete with the Soviet
                        Union. One is militarily through a prospective or actual war, which we both
                        want to avoid. The other is what we are doing. We are meeting them
                        competitively in the political realm and also in the philosophical and moral
                        and ethnic [<hi rend="italic">ethical</hi>?] realm. And that’s where the
                        competition goes on.</p>
                    <p>“If the Soviets should sign <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II and, in
                        effect, ratify it—which is, I think, inevitable—and if we should sign it and
                        then reject it, we would lose our competitive ability to reach effectively
                        the hearts and minds of other people around the world who will be making a
                        choice between us, on the one hand, and the Soviets, on the other, in the
                        future for military, political, trade alliances; because the Soviets can put
                        themselves through a massive propaganda effort, which would be inevitable,
                        too, in their role of a powerful but fair and peace-loving nation.</p>
                    <p>“We would be put in the role of a powerful nation that was, in effect, in
                        their opinion, a warmonger who refused even to participate in an equitable
                        restraint on the most destructive weapons on Earth. And <pb n="611"
                            facs="0652" xml:id="pg_611"/>how we could deal effectively as a nation
                        in competition with the Soviets after we rejected the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> treaty is something that I cannot
                        understand and which I would hate to have to face as a President.</p>
                    <p>“So, I am asking the Senators—the ones that were sitting around this table
                        day before yesterday [May 9]—’Before you vote on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss>, take yourselves out of the role of a Senator or out of
                        the role of the chairman or a member of the Armed Services Committee or the
                        Foreign Relations Committee, and put yourself in the position of the
                        President, who would have to implement a national policy and an
                        international policy after our Nation was crippled, in effect, by the
                        consequences of a <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II rejection.’</p>
                    <p>“This is undoubtedly the most important single issue that I will ever have to
                        face as President, unless we are faced with actual war. And I hope that
                        every American will join in with me, not in a quiescent way, just observing
                        what’s going on, but in an active way. And I particularly hope the news
                        media will assess the details of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        agreement, the consequences of either passage or rejection, and let your
                        voices be heard in the strongest possible way.</p>
                    <p>“It transcends partisanship; it transcends the necessary objectivity of the
                        news media toward politicians. And I hope that legitimately, within the
                        bounds of the role of the news media, that you will actively support and
                        promote the ratification of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        treaty.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"

                        bring the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> to recognize the need for a
                        comprehensive strategic arms control process, despite the then-blazing
                        Vietnam conflict.</p>
                    <p>You will be meeting Leonid Brezhnev in a setting of unusual uncertainty and
                        difficulty. Never has the mixed character of the relationship of cooperation
                        and competion been more in evidence. Despite the successful completion of
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, U.S.-Soviet relations are
                        clearly strained by a number of conflicting interests. The United States is
                        increasingly skeptical of Soviet intentions because of the momentum of its
                        military programs and its intervention in the Third World. In the past, we
                        could discount Soviet intentions because Soviet capabilities were limited;
                        today, even benign Soviet intentions are becoming increasingly suspect
                        because of the implications of Soviet capabilities.</p>
                    <pb n="613" facs="0654" xml:id="pg_613"/>
                    <p>A further and critical element of uncertainty is due to the fact that the
                        Soviet Union is already undergoing the trauma of a succession crisis. We do
                        not know when Brezhnev will be replaced nor by whom. However, at Vienna you
                        will be communicating through Brezhnev with the whole collective leadership,
                        and—hopefully—through it perhaps also with the next generation of Soviet
                        leaders as well. In some ways this may diminish the importance of whatever
                        personal rapport you can develop with Brezhnev, but it enhances the
                        importance of the signals and messages that you will want to transmit.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. side is also an uncertain quantity to the Soviet side. The firm
                        centerpiece of the relationship now is <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> but the fate of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II
                        in the Senate is unsure. The sensitivity of the United States to assertive
                        Soviet behavior in the developing world, combined with our reluctance to get
                        involved, makes it difficult for the Soviets to predict our reactions and
                        can create the possibility of dangerous miscalculations.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Soviet Objectives</p>
                    <p>The Soviets have ample reason to invest in the relationship. They do not want
                        our economic and technological might mobilized against them. They do not
                        want us to move closer to China.<note n="7" xml:id="d120fn7">The President
                            underlined most of this sentence and the previous one.</note> They want
                        to reduce the chances that security issues in conflict between us boil up to
                        confrontation, yet they are unlikely to yield their positions in Africa, the
                        Middle East or anywhere else.</p>
                    <p>While you would like to accomplish as much as possible—including
                        strengthening <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II reductions, agreeing
                        on a number of other arms control measures and reconciling differences in
                        the Third World—the Soviets have made it clear to us that they would be
                        satisfied with signing <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and having a
                        positive atmosphere. We have their draft communique (Tab B). It is down to
                        earth and businesslike. It has the usual Soviet boiler plate but is
                        surprisingly moderate and breaks little new ground. They want to minimize
                        consideration of contentious security and regional issues. They are prepared
                        to reach further agreement on <gloss target="#t_ASAT_1">ASAT</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1">MBFR</gloss> but we don’t know whether they
                        are willing to make the needed concessions. They say little about economic
                        relations, obviously seeking to avoid being a supplicant.</p>
                    <p>In effect, the Soviet objective is to create the impression of a U.S.-Soviet
                        partnership in the management of world affairs; to downplay the importance
                        of the U.S.-Chinese relationship;<note n="8" xml:id="d120fn8">The President
                            underlined most of this clause and the previous one.</note> to improve
                        the atmospherics and some tangibles of the U.S.-Soviet bilateral
                        relationship; but not to limit in any way Soviet freedom of action in
                        regards either to Europe or some of the Third World areas of turbulence.</p>
                    <pb n="614" facs="0655" xml:id="pg_614"/>
                    <p>In addition, the schedule proposed by the Soviet side minimizes public
                        exposure and thus diminishes their usual penchant for public cameraderie.
                        Above all, we are getting one message—no surprises.<note n="9"
                            xml:id="d120fn9">The President underlined the phrase “no
                            surprises.”</note> Their approach is one of extreme caution. What they
                        appear to fear most is the picture of a young U.S. President making dramatic
                        initiatives (<hi rend="italic">a la</hi> March 1977) without careful
                        preparation in advance to ensure their acceptability to the Soviet
                        leadership.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Tone and Style</p>
                    <p>Given the character of Soviet objectives, atmosphere will be a particularly
                        important aspect of this summit.<note n="10" xml:id="d120fn10">The President
                            underlined the words “atmosphere” and “particularly important.”</note>
                        Every indication is that both sides seek a positive atmosphere. We should
                        understand, however, that the Soviets have more to gain and less to lose
                        than you do from pumping up the atmospherics. A glowing summit gives the
                        Soviet leadership a boost at home and abroad, because they face no public
                        comparison between pretense and actual results.</p>
                    <p>In managing the atmosphere and the substance of the summit, a number of
                        points deserve being kept in mind:</p>
                    <p>1. There is little to be gained by philosophical discourse or ideological
                        debate with the Soviet leaders; they are not psychologically confident
                        enough to engage at the philosophical level as the Chinese do; in
                        particular, trying to debate rules of conduct becomes frustrating because of
                        the gap in perceptions;<note n="11" xml:id="d120fn11">In this point, the
                            President underlined “little to be gained,” “ideological debate,” and
                            “rules of conduct.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Concrete issues, however, are more easily resolved but only if they have
                        been well prepared and the Soviets do not have to contend with surprises
                        that have not been aired by the collective leadership;<note n="12"
                            xml:id="d120fn12">In this point, the President underlined “Concrete
                            issues” and “well prepared.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. Soviet leaders are quite sensitive to their personal treatment;<note
                            n="13" xml:id="d120fn13">The President underlined “sensitive to their
                            personal treatment.”</note> they are particularly concerned over any
                        slights reflecting the inferiority of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                            >USSR</gloss>. This will be a particularly important issue at this
                        summit with Brezhnev’s ill health. It is not in our interest to exploit his
                        infirmities.</p>
                    <p>4. Meeting the “people” is of little interest to the Soviets. Their
                        preoccupation is with those who have the power of decision. As a concession
                        to us, they have reluctantly agreed on a joint call by the two Presidents on
                        Austrian President Kirchschlager.</p>
                    <pb n="615" facs="0656" xml:id="pg_615"/>
                    <p>5. There is no basis for “personal trust”;<note n="14" xml:id="d120fn14">The
                            President underlined most of this clause.</note> the Soviet system
                        breeds power struggles; it is unlikely they would trust foreigners if they
                        do not trust their own colleagues; expecting Western leaders to act against
                        their class or national interest would subject a Soviet leader to ridicule,
                        if not worse, in the Politburo;</p>
                    <p>6. Talks, that is conversation, mean little compared to the reassurance found
                        in written documents and precise obligations; that is one reason why
                        communiques and joint principles and treaties have more importance in the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> than in other diplomatic
                        exchanges; but the “spirit” of a document is virtually non-existent;<note
                            n="15" xml:id="d120fn15">In this point, the President underlined “Talks”
                            and “mean little.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>7. The main value to you may be simply to get some feel for the mind set of
                        the Soviets and their mode of reasoning. The top Soviet leaders do in fact
                        have extraordinary power and will make decisions. But they have no great
                        incentive to make concessions and thereby expose themselves
                            politically.<note n="16" xml:id="d120fn16">The President underlined “no
                            great incentive to make concessions.”</note> Negotiations therefore take
                        place within a pre-defined framework, and on any issue it is important for
                        the Soviets to point to the precise concession they extracted in the
                        bargaining.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Scenario</p>
                    <p>We originally wanted at least four days of talks. The Soviets have reduced
                        the time available for discussion by making the first and fourth days
                        largely ceremonial and by insisting that your private meeting with Brezhnev
                        be on the last day. At this point we have agreed to a minimum of seven hours
                        of talks with the possibility of two more on the final day before signing
                        the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> Treaty.</p>
                    <p>This will put a premium on the conversations at the two dinners. Accordingly
                        we have in mind making them as small as possible—you, Cy, Harold, me and
                        Dave <persName corresp="#p_JD_1">Jones</persName> on our side and Brezhnev,
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName>, Alexandrov, Ustinov and
                            <persName corresp="#p_ON_1">Ogarkov</persName> on theirs. Soviet
                        attendance however is not yet set.</p>
                    <p>Equally important is the sequence of substantive issues. The first working
                        day (Saturday, June 16) will be devoted to <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> and other arms control issues. This will be an upbeat day
                        and we will be the hosts for the talks and the dinner. The next day will be
                        hosted by the Soviets and will involve more contentious arms control,
                        security and regional issues.</p>
                    <p>This will be the most important meeting from the standpoint of conveying
                        firmness and determination to defend our interests. It will inevitably be
                        more downbeat, with the atmosphere more filled with <pb n="616" facs="0657"
                            xml:id="pg_616"/>conflict and tension. The last day will see a private
                        meeting and the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> and other document
                        signing and this should provide a positive conclusion to the summit.</p>
                    <p>In effect we have something of a drama—at first things are good, then they
                        turn tense, then finally there is a positive resolution. The toasts and your
                        remarks at the signing ceremony will be the key indicators of what is
                        transpiring and they must be carefully crafted with that in mind. At the
                        outset of the talks we must be careful to moderate expectations. The theme
                        of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> plus serious consultations, as we
                        agreed previously, is the best note to strike before the summit begins.<note
                            n="17" xml:id="d120fn17">The President underlined “<gloss

                    <p>This wary and uncertain setting makes it important that we concentrate on
                        those objectives that have the greatest potential for longer term impact on
                        the U.S.-Soviet relationship. I would define the central strategic
                        objectives of the Vienna Summit in the following terms:</p>
                    <p>1. To consummate <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II and to initiate
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> III;</p>
                    <p>2. To give additional impetus to further U.S.-Soviet arms control measures
                        (such as <gloss target="#t_ASAT_1">ASAT</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_MBFR_1"

                    <p>3. To make not only Brezhnev but also the Soviet leaders who stayed at home
                        more aware that the U.S. sees the Soviet Union as insensitive to our vital
                        interests or concerns in such regions as the Middle East, Southern Africa,
                        Cuba, and Vietnam.<note n="18" xml:id="d120fn18">The President underlined

                            and placed a question mark under each. In the right-hand margin next to
                            this point, he wrote “W. Europe, S. Asia, N. Africa,

                    <p>In effect, your objective is to demonstrate that the United States can
                        successfully manage the contradictory positive and negative tendencies in
                        our relationship. To do that, you must articulate a conception of a
                        reciprocal and realistic detente, based not only on the common interest in
                        avoiding nuclear war, but also on genuine respect for each side’s security
                            concerns.<note n="19" xml:id="d120fn19">The President underlined the
                            phrases “common interest in avoiding nuclear war” and “respect for each

                        Soviet leaders about our deep dissatisfaction with Soviet performance on a
                        whole range of security-related issues. They must be made to understand that
                        to move in a constructive direction now, U.S.-Soviet relations must involve
                        positive Soviet behavior on key security issues of paramount U.S.
                        concern.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, Soviet leaders must be convinced that our complaints do not
                        derive from a desire for bad U.S.-Soviet relations, or from <pb n="617"
                            facs="0658" xml:id="pg_617"/>the desire to gain a one-sided
                        advantage—but that we genuinely wish those relations to improve.<note n="20"

                    </p>
                    <p>To this end, it is essential that all key members of your delegation be
                        explicitly instructed to deliberately and repeatedly emphasize certain key
                        and simple themes to their Soviet counterparts. Only a delegation that
                        speaks with a united voice, that keeps repeating the same key themes is
                        likely to convey the message that needs to be heard back in the Kremlin.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, I would recommend that you instruct everyone going to Vienna to
                        make the following points to every Soviet that they encounter:</p>
                    <p>1. The United States wishes to join the Soviet Union in containing the
                        nuclear arms race through further cuts in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> II and more ambitious cuts in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> III, as well as through other arms control measures;<note
                            n="21" xml:id="d120fn21">The President wrote “ok” in the right-hand
                            margin next to this point and, beneath the point, added “We should
                            mutually enhance verification techniques.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>2. The United States wishes to see the Soviet Union as a partner in dealing
                        with many emerging global problems, the solution of which need not be the
                        object of ideological disputes (food, development, energy, etc.);<note
                            n="22" xml:id="d120fn22">The President wrote “ok” in the right-hand
                            margin next to this point and, beneath the point, added “Closer regular
                            consultations.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. The United States cannot be indifferent to Soviet insensitivity to our
                        concerns in such areas as the Middle East, Southern Africa, Vietnam, or
                        Cuba—and such insensitivity will produce strong American reactions,
                        particularly on matters which are of concern to the Soviet Union (e.g.,
                            China);<note n="23" xml:id="d120fn23">The President wrote below this
                            point “VNam, Cuba ok but too narrow. South Asia, N. Africa more
                            important.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>4. Soviet military buildup, both strategic and conventional, has gone beyond
                        the point of legitimate defense needs, and is generating a genuine threat to
                        the United States and its principal Allies—and unless the Soviet side shows
                        restraint, the West, with the United States in the lead, will undertake
                        major, comprehensive, and matching efforts.</p>
                    <p>If we succeed in communicating these messages effectively, we will have
                        achieved our basic objectives. <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II
                        ratification will get a boost. Our Allies will maintain confidence in our
                        leadership. You will have set a clear framework for a constructive
                        U.S.-Soviet relationship regardless of who succeeds Brezhnev.</p>

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Next Steps</p>
                    <p>The final impression of the meeting will be shaped by the communique issued
                        jointly by the two parties. It must be prepared well in advance. We need
                        your guidance, therefore, on how to proceed on the full range of issues that
                        are candidates for discussion.</p>
                    <p>In response to your admonition that we not be timid in our goals for the
                        Summit, Tab A contains a statement of our maximum objectives organized
                        around the agenda as it now stands. However, realism dictates the conclusion
                        that not all these objectives will be attained at the Summit itself. The
                        Soviets have also stressed to us that they desire “no surprises.” It follows
                        therefore that these objectives need to be prioritized and prepared in
                        advance with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, I would welcome your guidance as to which of the items at Tab A
                        you want us to pursue with particular vigor. Once I know your priorities,
                        and with your permission, I will ask <persName corresp="#p_DAF_1"
                            >Dobrynin</persName> to join me and <persName corresp="#p_CWM_1"
                            >Christopher</persName> for a preliminary review of those items which
                        ought to be discussed with the Soviets in advance of the Vienna Summit. In
                        this manner, we will enhance the prospects of attaining not only our broad
                        strategic objectives, but also the more concrete goals listed in Tab A.</p>

                        <p>Summit meetings between the American President and the Soviet leaders
                            inevitably stimulate great expectations that a new and favorable turning
                            point will be reached. Rarely have positive expectations been justified;
                            in those cases of a relatively “successful” summit, the results have
                            been produced more by the surrounding or preceding circumstances than by
                            the actual negotiations between the leaders.</p>
                        <p>One of the problems is the persistent American belief that such meetings
                            are of special significance because they: (1) create “goodwill” among
                            the participants; create a better “atmosphere” for resolving issues and
                            permit the American case to be made to the leaders that have the power
                            of decision. These attitudes explain in part why in retrospect <pb
                                n="619" facs="0660" xml:id="pg_619"/>summit meetings have seemed of
                            such little value and on occasion even dangerously misleading.</p>
                        <p>The tone and approach to summits was set by President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RFD_1">Roosevelt</persName>, who had great confidence in
                            his own ability to deal with foreign leaders, and he saw Stalin largely
                            in terms of an adversary who could be won over by powers of persuasion.
                            Because the actual substance of the wartime meetings was secret, they
                            were represented as dramatic success stories. The inevitable post-war
                            disillusionment made all summits appear dangerous traps, in which the
                            Soviets received major concessions.</p>
                        <p>The death of Stalin in 1953, however, revived summitry; Churchill sensed
                            that the Kremlin might be in some disarray and wanted to confront the
                            new leaders; <persName corresp="#p_DJF_1">Dulles</persName> was
                            skeptical, but even <persName corresp="#p_EDD_1">Eisenhower</persName>
                            was intrigued. He wrote:</p>
                        <p>“ . . . a major preoccupation of my mind throughout most of 1953 was the
                            development of approaches to the Soviet leaders that might be at least a
                            start toward the birth of mutual trust.”</p>
                        <p>The quest for “mutual trust” was in fact the theme of the Geneva summit
                            of July 1955, and the subsequent “spirit” the meeting engendered.<note

                            valves to drain the threatened crisis of a separate German peace treaty.
                            The well known summit in Paris of May 1960, was aborted by the <gloss

                                relative merits of capitalism and Communism. The argument became
                                known as the “kitchen debate.”</note> at the 1961 Vienna summit the
                            two leaders consumed great time in arguing over the merits of their
                            respective economic and political systems. Naturally, neither was
                            persuaded by the other’s arguments, but it may be that <persName

                        <p>There may in fact have been something to the personal rapport established

                            particularly since after the first meeting there were no major divisive
                            issues on the agenda. The assumptions of “detente” were under fire,

                            then Brezhnev was beginning to show signs of wear; he was particularly
                            fatigued by the round of meetings at Helsinki and not pleased by what
                            seemed a western success in the speeches, publicity and documents.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A few general observations on Summits may be in
                            order:</p>
                        <p>1. There is little to be gained by philosophical discourse or ideological
                            debate with the Soviet leaders; they are not psychologically confident
                            enough to engage at the philosophical level as the Chinese do; in
                            particular, trying to debate rules of conduct becomes frustrating
                            because of the gap in perceptions;<note n="35" xml:id="d120fn35">In the
                                right-hand margin next to this point and the next six points, the
                                President placed a checkmark.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Concrete issues, however, are more easily resolved but only if they
                            have been well prepared and the Soviets do not have to contend with
                            surprises that have not been aired by the collective leadership;</p>
                        <p>3. Soviet leaders are quite sensitive to their personal treatment; they
                            are particularly concerned over any slights reflecting the inferiority
                            of the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. Meeting the “people” is of little interest to the Soviets. Their
                            preoccupation is with those who have the power of decision (this,
                            incidentally, is why Congressional delegations do so poorly in the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>);</p>
                        <p>5. There is no basis for “personal trust”; the Soviet system breeds power
                            struggles; it is unlikely they would trust foreigners if they do not
                            trust their own colleagues; expecting western leaders to act against
                            their class or national interest would subject a Soviet leader to
                            ridicule, if not worse, in the politburo;</p>
                        <pb n="622" facs="0663" xml:id="pg_622"/>
                        <p>6. Talks, that is conversation, mean little compared to the reassurance
                            found in written documents and precise obligations; that is one reason
                            why communiques and joint principles and treaties have more importance
                            in the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> than in other diplomatic
                            exchanges; but the “spirit” of a document is virtually non-existent;</p>
                        <p>7. The main value to Western leaders may be simply to get some feel for
                            the mind set of the Soviets and their mode of reasoning. The top Soviet
                            leaders do in fact have extraordinary power and will make decisions. But
                            they have no great incentive to make concessions and thereby expose
                            themselves politically. Negotiations therefore take place within a
                            pre-defined framework, and on any issue it is important for the Soviets
                            to point to the precise concession they extracted in the bargaining.</p>

                    <p>On the basis of a very hurried survey of the goals material you gave me
                        today, I conclude:</p>
                    <p>1. The Administration’s impressive accomplishments in foreign policy look
                        much less impressive when compared with the goals the Administration set for
                        itself in 1977.<note n="3" xml:id="d122fn3">
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> placed a vertical
                            line in the left-hand margin next to this sentence.</note> This is due
                        not to a paucity of achievement but rather to the scope and magnitude of the
                        goals. A dramatic example of this is Arab-Israeli relations, where the
                        Administration obviously scored a major triumph at Camp David, but which
                        does not produce a very good rating when compared to the goal of a
                        comprehensive peace settlement including Palestinians and with Saudi
                        involvement and backing. As a consequence of this phenomenon, however, it
                        clearly would not be desirable to use the April 1977 goals statement<note
                            n="4" xml:id="d122fn4">See <ref target="#d36">Document 36</ref>.</note>
                        in any public presentation of the Administration’s foreign policy
                        record.</p>
                    <p>2. The 1977 goals do make for some interesting reading now as a reflection of
                        the dominant approaches to foreign policy at the start of the
                        Administration. Despite the fact that this statement was primarily the work
                        of you and me, it is still striking to me now to see the important role in
                        it of the foreign policy approach which you labeled “Liberal 2” in your
                        January 1978 report.<note n="5" xml:id="d122fn5">See <ref target="#d62"
                                >Document 62</ref>.</note> In this connection, it might be useful to
                        do a think piece for purely internal consumption on why it was the
                        Administration was so successful in achieving its goals in some areas (e.g.,
                        China) and unsuccessful in others (e.g., Africa). I suspect such an analysis
                        would relate success and failure to the extent to which the goals were based
                        on realistic assumptions concerning the hard power politics of the
                        situation. While I won’t give it a high priority, if you’re <pb n="626"
                            facs="0667" xml:id="pg_626"/>agreeable, I may at some point try to
                        undertake such an interpretive re-evaluation.<note n="6" xml:id="d122fn6">

                    </p>
                    <p>Attached at Tab A is a topical outline of the goals statement with my
                        judgments as to how well the Administration has done so far in achieving the
                        goals it set out for itself. In many areas, my knowledge of the detailed
                        specifics of these actions is rather limited, and here I have simply put a
                        question mark. In other cases, I’ve made guesses that may or may not be very
                        well informed. Performance is graded on a scale of zero to ten, with the
                        latter meaning achievement of all goals set forth in the paper. In arriving
                        at these ratings, I have also made some qualitative judgments about the
                        relative importance of specific goals within each topic.</p>
                    <p>Obviously, I could go around and get a much more accurate read-out of how
                        well we’ve done by talking with the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>
                        specialists in each area, but I have doubts as to whether that would really
                        produce a great deal more that was useful.</p>

                    <p>As we thought about how you will allocate your time in the next eighteen
                        months, we tried to identify ongoing issues which will continue to require
                        your attention, to subjects that you might want to leave primarily to others
                        in the Department, and new areas of concentration.</p>
                    <p>We start with the premise that, after your <gloss target="#t_UNGA_1"

                        dividend of unallocated time. Unless you give some clear signals on how you
                        expect to use this time, the bureaucracy naturally will try to <pb n="629"

                        energetic approach to new areas, so as not to be perceived, in the final
                        months, as a lame duck.<note n="5" xml:id="d123fn5">

                    <p>We do not suggest that the coming months will provide fertile ground for

                        difficult.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>We are in a new period.</p>
                    <p>There will be no more foreign policy extravaganzas requiring long planning
                        and negotiation, sustained Presidential involvement, and extensive
                        Congressional debate (such as the Panama Canal Treaties, China
                        normalization, and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>). Thus, before
                        discussing the ten goals, I want to describe some of the constraints of the
                        new context in which we will be operating in the remainder of the Term.</p>
                    <p>(a) The time is short, more like a year than 18 months. In the immediate
                        future, the focus will be on <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. If
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> is approved by Thanksgiving, that
                        leaves less than a year until the 1980 Presidential elections.</p>
                    <p>(b) Priority for domestic issues will preclude the President’s personal
                        involvement in foreign policy initiatives requiring a major commitment of
                        his time. Existing commitments (e.g., Middle East negotiations), the
                        day-to-day flow of foreign “crises”, and unavoidable state visits will
                        continue to occupy an important place on the President’s calendar, but he
                        will not be able to make substantial time for new initiatives. And probably
                        he shouldn’t. It is also realistic to note that the President does not have
                        a large store of political capital that he can draw on to manage foreign
                        policy initiatives.</p>
                    <p>(c) After <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, the Congress will be unable
                        to give foreign policy issues the major chunks of time which it has given
                        such issues in the first three years. Of course, Congress will spend a
                        substantial amount of time in 1980 dealing with unavoidable foreign policy
                        items (such as trade agreements and appropriations), but in the main the
                        Congress will want to spend its time focusing on energy and the economy. And
                        probably it should.</p>
                    <p>(d) Our goals will be constricted by election year politics. This does not
                        mean that we should step back from projects which are in the national
                        interest, but we must recognize that our ability to initiate and accomplish
                        must reckon with political factors. The President’s political <pb n="640"
                            facs="0681" xml:id="pg_640"/>advisers will naturally want to avoid
                        foreign policy actions which would be unpopular with segments of the
                        electorate. In addition, with the long stream of primaries, we can expect
                        even ephemeral issues to be stridently debated in public.</p>
                    <p>We may be able to overcome the foregoing constraints in specific instances,
                        but they will provide the overall context. In that context, the following
                        are ten points for emphasis in the last 18 months.</p>

                        requiring some Presidential and Senatorial time, this goal could be within

                        that we make it one of the highest foreign policy objectives for 1980. If we

                        mobilization of business support as well as sensitive dealings with the
                        interests groups. Once approved, we should give a strong impetus to the

                        ourselves on this issue. One way to do this—and a way that could have great
                        substantive benefits as well—would be to explore fully the possibilities of
                        joint development of the tar sands in Canada and Venezuela. There is wide
                        agreement that these tar sands deposits are an enormous source of potential
                        energy which could be developed if sufficient capital is made available from
                        governmental sources. We should make sure that our new energy legislation is
                        flexible enough to permit such joint development.</p>
                    <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Normalizing Diplomatic Relations</hi>. The United States
                        had less-than-normal relations with 13 countries when we came into office.
                        We now have reduced that to 10 countries: Albania, Angola, Cuba (Interests
                        Section), Equatorial Guinea, Kampuchea, Iraq (Interests Section), North
                        Korea, South Yemen, Vietnam, Zimbabwe/Rhodesia. We should improve this
                        record during the last 18 months, asking ourselves in each instance whether
                        a continuation of the current anomaly serves any national interest.
                        Normalization in some instances may prove to be politically impossible,
                        either from a domestic or international standpoint. However, there are other
                        instances where we can make progress without impinging on any of the
                        constraints set forth at the beginning of this memorandum. Vietnam will be
                        one of the most difficult, but also one of the most important. Progress in
                        our relations with all three African countries on the list would seem a
                        reachable goal. An end to the isolation of Rhodesia would be especially
                        welcome.</p>

                    <p>Finally, a postscript about your own activities. I firmly believe that you
                        should increase your contacts with the American public in the forthcoming

                        appearances (where your statements do not get the attention they deserve).
                        It would mean more U.S. television appearances, which should be undertaken
                        even if it means cutting something else out.</p>
                    <p>In such speeches and appearances, I urge that you relax your discipline and
                        discuss your philosophy and concept of American security and foreign policy.
                        It would be good for the American people to hear it. And it would be helpful
                        to the President.</p>

                    <p>“At the time that I made the decision to build the MX, I established five

                        Second, it must be verifiable so as to set a standard which can serve as a

                        taxpayer. And fifth, it must be consistent with existing <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> agreements and with our <gloss

                        mutual reductions in strategic forces.”</p>
                    <p>The President provided additional details as to the configuration of the MX
                        system and then outlined how the configuration met the essential criteria.
                        He concluded his remarks, noting:</p>
                    <p>“Unhappily, we do not yet live in the kind of world that permits us to devote
                        all our resources to the works of peace. And as President, I have no higher
                        duty than to ensure that the security of the United States will be protected
                        beyond doubt. As long as the threat of war persists, we will do what we must
                        to deter that threat to our Nation’s security. If <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> II is ratified and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        III is successful, then the time may come when no President will have to
                        make this kind of decision again and the MX system will be the last weapon
                        system of such enormous destructive power that we will ever have to build. I
                        fervently pray for that time, but until it comes, we will build what we
                        must, even as we continue to work for mutual restraint in strategic
                        armaments.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"

                    <p>At 2:35 that afternoon, the President took part in an interview and
                        question-and-answer session with reporters. The interview took place in the
                        Cabinet Room in the White House. The President began the session by
                        stating:</p>
                    <p>“This is an interesting day for you to be in Washington. We have, as usual,
                        an accumulation of both domestic and foreign issues to be addressed by me
                        and by my associates, with whom you’ve met already.</p>
                    <p>“It is a coincidence that we have already had a major announcement on the
                        deployment of the MX missile in a mobile form this morning, and in just a
                        few minutes, about 4 o’clock, I will make a statement to the Nation
                        concerning Soviet troops in Cuba.”</p>
                    <p>The President highlighted a variety of domestic issues and then answered
                        questions from the assembled reporters. In response to a question about
                        Soviet and American postures regarding defense, the President asserted:</p>
                    <p>“When I assess in my own mind the trends in Soviet influence the last 10 or
                        15 years, say—just to get out of my own administration and to make it a
                        bipartisan thing—versus the Soviet Union, I’m very encouraged.</p>
                    <p>“The Soviets did win an advantage in Afghanistan. That Soviet-endorsed
                        government is in substantial danger, and that’s significant. But when you
                        compare that with our new relationship with India, compared to what it was 5
                        years ago, or our new relationship with Egypt, the strongest and most
                        powerful Arab country, compared to what it was during the time of the Aswan
                        Dam construction when Egypt was <pb n="645" facs="0686" xml:id="pg_645"
                        />absolutely committed to the Soviet Union and was dependent on the Soviet
                        Union for military and economic aid, and now are completely friends with us
                        and have prohibited Soviet technicians and others from coming into the
                        country—that’s a major change in the Mideast itself.</p>
                    <p>“The People’s Republic of China, a fourth of the people on Earth—it wasn’t
                        long ago that they were endorsed and supported by and were the closest of
                        allies with the Soviet Union. Now, we have a new and burgeoning friendship
                        with the people of the People’s Republic of China, and we have not lost our
                        financial and economic and friendly relationships with the people on
                        Taiwan.</p>
                    <p>“I could continue to go on, but those are major countries. There have also,
                        obviously, been some setbacks. I don’t deny that.</p>
                    <p>“I think that the present commitment that I have given to defense has
                        reversed a longstanding trend. For 15 years, our country was making no real
                        increase in defense expenditures. In fact, when I came into office, our real
                        commitment to defense was less than it was in 1963. This year, the current
                        fiscal year, we have accommodated all the impact of inflation, and we have
                        at least a 3-percent growth in defense expenditures.</p>
                    <p>I think we have restrengthened <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, which
                        was very weak, not only militarily but politically. There’s a new spirit and
                        a new dynamism and a new cooperation in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> that did not exist before.</p>
                    <p>“On strategic weapons systems, if you take our sea-based missiles and you
                        assess the dramatic progress being made with the Trident submarines and the
                        new Trident missiles, that’s a quantum step forward. “The air-breathing leg
                        of our triad, with the new generations of cruise missiles coming
                        along—that’s a major technological and strategic breakthrough. And with the
                        MX missile that I announced this morning on land-based, silo-type
                        missiles—this is the first time that we have ever seen a single missile
                        acquire such a tremendous importance, and it not only gives our country a
                        better defense or attack capability, it also contributes to stability
                        because you’ve got a lot more defense with a lot fewer missiles.</p>
                    <p>“So, I think that if you look at other factors—our espousing human rights,
                        the economic strength of our country, our overall trade relationships—in
                        almost every measure, I do not see our country as being affected
                        detrimentally, as contrasted with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>“We recognize that they are a military nation; they put a lot more emphasis
                        on military weaponry than do we. And we are much more inclined to support
                        the status quo, to put down regional conflagrations and conflicts than are
                        the Soviet Union. They espouse a revolutionary political thesis and, to
                        them, the change of governments, quite often, is in their advantage. We,
                        generally, are inclined to support the gov<pb n="646" facs="0687"
                            xml:id="pg_646"/>ernment that is in power, unless it is so obnoxious to
                        our own standards and principles that we cannot accept it.</p>
                    <p>“So, the Soviets are inclined to stir up trouble; we’re inclined to try to
                        dampen trouble and to provide peace. That’s one thing that gives them an
                        advantage when there is trouble. But I think we have stood up well against
                        them, and I think we can continue to do it in the future on a peaceful,
                        competitive basis. There’s no doubt in my mind that the ideals and the
                        principles and the basic strengths of America can prevail and have
                        prevailed.” (Ibid., pages 1607, 1611–1613)</p>
                    <p>At 4:15 p.m. that afternoon, in the Briefing Room at the White House, the
                        President spoke to reporters concerning the presence of a Soviet combat
                        brigade in Cuba. Earlier, at a September 5 press conference, Secretary of
                        State <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cyrus Vance</persName> had asserted that
                        this development “is a matter of serious concern.” (Department of State <hi

                            corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>’s remarks and added:</p>
                    <p>“We are confident about our ability to defend our country or any of our
                        friends from external aggression. The issue posed is of a different nature.
                        It involves the stationing of Soviet combat troops here in the Western
                        Hemisphere, in a country which acts as a Soviet proxy in military adventures
                        in other areas of the world, like Africa.</p>
                    <p>“We do have the right to insist that the Soviet Union respect our interests
                        and our concerns if the Soviet Union expects us to respect their
                        sensibilities and their concerns. Otherwise, relations between our two
                        countries will inevitably be adversely affected. We are seriously pursuing
                        this issue with the Soviet Union, and we are consulting closely with the
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>“Let me emphasize that this is a sensitive issue that faces our Nation, all
                        of us, and our Nation as a whole must respond not only with firmness and
                        strength but also with calm and a sense of proportion.</p>
                    <p>“This is a time for firm diplomacy, not panic and not exaggeration. As
                        Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> discusses this issue
                        with Soviet representatives in the coming days, the Congress and the
                        American people can help to ensure a successful outcome of these discussions
                        and negotiations by preserving an atmosphere in which our diplomacy can
                        work.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"

                    <p>I think all of us in this Administration should think through two questions,
                        which are both perplexing and troublesome:</p>
                    <p>1. Why is the public not giving this Administration, and particularly the
                        President, due credit for genuinely substantive foreign policy
                        accomplishments—accomplishments which no other Administration in recent
                        years has matched in a comparable period of time?</p>
                    <p>2. Why is public opinion in the world at large, notably in allied countries,
                        viewing this Administration as perhaps the most timid since World War
                        II?</p>
                    <p>The easy answer to these questions is that the U.S. public is simply
                        misinformed, because of the excessively critical and even prejudiced views
                        of the Washington press corps; and that this jaundiced perspective, echoed
                        by a mindless foreign press, then shaped the stereotypes with which we are
                        now saddled.</p>
                    <p>There is doubtless some truth in that answer, and perhaps even a great deal
                        of truth. However, it is certainly not the entire truth. I think that to
                        find a more complete explanation one has to take a closer look at the
                        increasingly pervasive feeling in the country and abroad that in the
                        U.S.-Soviet relationship the Soviet side increasingly is the assertive party
                        and the U.S. side is the more acquiescent. This is seen as true in terms of
                        arms competition, though you are the first President in a decade and a half
                        to reverse the trends; this is seen as especially true in terms of
                        international behavior, particularly in relationship to the various trouble
                        spots. For better or for worse, we were passive in Iran; the Soviets are far
                        from passive in Afghanistan. We pursued a diplomatically amiable policy in
                        Africa; the Soviets relied on Cuban arms, not without some effect. In Latin
                        America, and particularly in Central America, revolutionary fervor is on the
                        rise, and we have not been able to give those who want to rely on us a sense
                        of security.</p>
                    <pb n="648" facs="0689" xml:id="pg_648"/>
                    <p>To be sure we have gained notable diplomatic successes—China normalization,
                        India, and elsewhere—but these do not obviate the impression of
                        assertiveness on the one side and acquiescence on the other—despite Soviet
                        internal weaknesses, bureaucratic stagnation, and the dramatic drop in
                        Soviet ideological appeal.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, those decisions which you took and which were not only the right
                        decisions but the tough decisions—on such matters as China, the MX,<note

                        interpreted as primarily motivated by the desire either to compensate for
                        past weaknesses (e.g., Yemen vs. passivity on Ethiopia) or to obtain some
                        other desired result (e.g., to obtain <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>

                    <p>These perceptions, you and I know, are not correct—but they are part of the
                        political reality which provides part of the answer to the two questions
                        with which I opened. In addition, the neutron bomb debacle certainly did

                                target="#d73fn10">footnote 10, Document 73</ref>.</note> and today
                        much of the world is watching to see how we will behave on the Soviet/Cuban
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>None of the above is designed to suggest that we should somehow adopt a
                        reckless policy of confrontationism, nor is it meant to hint that our policy
                        has been one of appeasement. But it is meant to suggest that both in tone
                        and occasionally in substance, we have been excessively acquiescent,<note
                            n="5" xml:id="d126fn5">See Tab A. [Footnote in the original. Tab A, an
                            undated memorandum, is attached but not printed.]</note> and that the
                        country craves, and our national security needs, both a more assertive tone
                        and a more assertive substance to our foreign policy. I believe that both
                        for international reasons as well as for domestic political reasons you
                        ought to <hi rend="italic">deliberately toughen both the tone and the
                            substance of our foreign policy</hi>. The country associates
                        assertiveness with leadership, and the world at large expects American
                        leadership insofar as the Soviet challenge is concerned. That challenge is
                        real, and a recognition of it does not mean that we have to abandon such
                        positive objectives as arms control and notably <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> II. We should be mature enough to be able to seek, all at
                        the same time, <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II; and more defense
                        efforts; and pursue a more assertive foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>What would a more assertive foreign policy mean? As I said earlier, it does
                        not mean confrontation or war. It does mean, however, the following:</p>
                    <p>1. We are now beginning to do what needs to be done in defense, but we should
                        keep stressing that this is being done on its own merits <pb n="649"
                            facs="0690" xml:id="pg_649"/>and is not simply a means of buying <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>. In doing more for defense, as you have
                        done, we ought to stress publicly what you have often said privately: that
                        this is your prime responsibility and that you are the first President in 15
                        years to reverse the downward trends.</p>
                    <p>2. Less hesitation in explicitly condemning Soviet/Cuban exploitation of
                        Third World turbulence. This means occasionally a very tough-minded remark
                        by you and your instructions to the Secretary of State, to me, and to others
                        at least to echo or perhaps to go a touch beyond you. I have had no
                        difficulty in selling <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> (ask <persName
                            corresp="#p_WA_1">Anne Wexler</persName>) in the context of a tough
                        pitch. Thus toughening our rhetoric will not hurt <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> but probably help it, while projecting a firmer image. The
                        French have a saying: “c’est le ton qui fait la chanson” (it’s the tone that
                        makes the song). And our tone has been somewhat opaque; at least, that is
                        the way the country hears it, and what the country thinks it hears we have
                        to recognize as part of our reality.</p>
                    <p>3. We should adopt a forceful policy of ostracizing Cuba, of maximizing Cuban
                        economic difficulties by urging others to refrain from providing economic
                        assistance, by sharing massively all our intelligence on Cuban activities
                        and on the Soviet build-up of Cuban power-projection capability.</p>
                    <p>4. While our relationship with China has to stand on its own feet and we
                        cannot use China merely as a “card” against the Soviet Union, the fact is
                        that the U.S.-Chinese relationship does not operate in a vacuum. If the
                        Soviets are insensitive to our concerns, we should go beyond your warnings
                        and do some things in the Chinese-American relationship that they explicitly
                        do not like. This means, at this stage, the transfer of genuinely sensitive
                        technology to China and some consideration of a serious military dialogue
                        with the Chinese. We need not decide now how far we go in this, but we do
                        need to convey to the Soviets that their cynical use of the Cubans against
                        us will be reciprocated in a manner that in some fashion is painful to
                        them.</p>
                    <p>5. Radio Liberty/Voice of America should be instructed to step up their
                        broadcasts to Soviet national minorities, notably the Moslems and
                        Ukrainians. I see no reason why the Soviets should be free to agitate
                        against us in Puerto Rico as well as throughout the world but we should
                        somehow remain intimidated by the fact that Moscow is sensitive to the
                        problem of its national minorities.</p>
                    <p>6. We should resume our talks with the Soviets on the issues that you raised
                        with Brezhnev in Vienna: the need for reciprocal restraint.<note n="6"

                        to them that we are pre<pb n="650" facs="0691" xml:id="pg_650"/>pared to
                        take steps they do not like, and after two and a half years of making that
                        point we should actually take some such steps (as suggested above).
                        Moreover, I really wonder whether State can convey credibly to the Soviets
                        the proposition that we are prepared to retaliate.</p>
                    <p>7. There are also other things we could do—e.g., Afghanistan, etc.—but the
                        above indicates a range of possible reactions.</p>
                    <p>I know that the above is going to trouble you, and perhaps even irritate you.
                        However, the need to review our approach is now particularly timely because
                        of the Cuban problem. I do not see the issue of the Soviet brigade in Cuba
                        as posing a challenge of the 1962 type, and therefore I do not advocate
                        extreme solutions for it. But failure to cope with it firmly can have the
                        effect of vitiating your foreign accomplishments and conclusively stamping
                        this Administration as weak, and that is why I feel that in general the time
                        has come to adopt a more assertive posture.<note n="7" xml:id="d126fn7">I
                            also feel uneasy about how and with what determination the brigade issue
                            is now being negotiated. Only last Tuesday we presented our position to
                            the Soviets, indicating that the best outcome would be withdrawal,
                            though hinting that perhaps some other outcome could eventually be
                            considered; by Thursday the State Department was leaking that the Soviet
                            force may be in fact on a training mission and suggesting that
                            withdrawal was no longer an issue (see the authoritative leaks on
                            Thursday morning in both <hi rend="italic">The Washington Post</hi> and
                                <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>), hardly a way of
                            indicating to the Soviets that the issue is of grave concern to us and
                            that we are approaching the matter with resolve! [Footnote in the

                    <p>Adopting such a posture will require some specific decisions, thereby
                        prodding those parts of the government which have contributed so much to the
                        image of an acquiescent Administration. You may wish to use one of the
                        Friday morning breakfasts to discuss this larger issue. We all want to
                        follow as closely as possible the direction and the tone that you set, and
                        now may be the moment for a review and for some appropriate signals.</p>
                    <p>Finally, there is no doubt in my mind that the country will rally behind the
                        President as he responds firmly to a foreign challenge. <persName

                    <p>Most people think you are in a situation now which parallels that of
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> in 1962: the Cuban
                        missile crisis. Accordingly, subconsciously (and in the case of politicians,
                        expedientially) most people will compare the outcome, and you personally, to
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName>’s “success” in
                        October–November 1962.</p>
                    <p>Yet the situation is really not analogous; we face a political challenge, and
                        we cannot fully undo the reality we don’t like, whereas in 1962 we faced a
                        direct military challenge, and we could—through direct military
                        pressure—undo it. Yet if the outcome in the end appears to be inadequate,
                        most people will declare you as having been “defeated” and perhaps even
                        blame you for both generating the problem (note what <persName

                        being timid in responding to it.</p>
                    <p>In fact, you are facing a situation much more like that faced by <persName

                        the public that he would assert U.S. interests, and if necessary, be
                        prepared to use force. He sent additional troops to Berlin, and he put more
                        emphasis on our overall defense efforts—in addition to adopting a very tough
                        public posture on the Soviets. At the same time, he did not pretend—through
                        some cosmetic formula—to have solved the problem.</p>

                    <p>I personally do not favor sending more troops to Guantanamo, because
                        Guantanamo to most Latin Americans looks like an imperialist outpost from
                        days gone by—and it tends to reinforce the legitimacy of the Soviet troop
                        presence in Cuba. I do favor the other steps, which I have incorporated in
                        your speech outline: more defense, more intelligence, some limited steps
                        regarding China (because that actually does concern the Soviets and we have
                        to do at least one thing that genuinely bothers them), and a more generally
                        tough line on Soviet adventurism and disregard for our interests.<note n="2"

                        to enable us to proclaim a victory, and, much more important, even if we
                        did, I have not the slightest doubt that the public will not accept some
                        cosmetic arrangement of relocation within Cuba as a Carter “victory.”</p>
                    <p>For the foregoing reasons, I would recommend:</p>
                    <p>1. That we start talking up the Berlin wall analogy;<note n="3"

                    <p>3. That for the next several months at least we maintain a tough posture on

                    <p>What about <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> then? My view is that you

                        our national security, that it stands on its own feet, that it permits us to
                        pursue a genuinely mature foreign policy toward the Soviet Union, which
                        includes:</p>

                    <p>In the next fifteen months Americans will be primarily concerned with two
                        inter-related problems: the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> economy, and
                        the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> world role. This memorandum suggests
                        that the time is ripe for major and mutually reenforcing initiatives which
                        will set the tone for the Administration’s handling of both these issues
                        during the coming year. (C)</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Since the late 1940s most Americans have believed that a strong <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> world role was essential to a peaceful
                        world. And they have seen holding our own in competition with the <gloss
                            target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> as an essential element of that role. I
                        doubt most people are unduly excited about a few thousand Soviet soldiers in
                        Cuba. But they are excited about what they see as a continuing Soviet
                        attempt to exploit change in Third World areas; Cuba is only the latest
                            example.<note n="2" xml:id="d128fn2">The President underlined the
                            portion of the sentence beginning with “a” and ending with
                            “areas.”</note> (C)</p>
                    <p>There is some analogy here to inflation: No one expects Soviet pressure in
                        third areas to fade away quickly. But people do want some evidence that we
                        are mounting a comprehensive effort to meet the So<pb n="654" facs="0695"
                            xml:id="pg_654"/>viet challenge. As on the economic front, they want to
                        see some light at the end of the tunnel. (C)</p>
                    <p>What is needed to meet this need is less specific immediate actions (which
                        might look like gimmicks) than a basic change in emphasis, which will be
                        reflected in a variety of actions over time. The Cuban problem could be the
                        occasion for a speech spelling out that shift. You might recall that your
                        Annapolis speech had said that the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> was
                        ready to respond to either competition or cooperation, depending on Soviet

                        us will be unrewarding. This means:</p>
                    <p>—Responding directly to Soviet pressures in Third World areas, e.g., by
                        military aid to intended victims and, if requested by countries of the
                        region concerned, by interdicting the movement of outside forces across
                        national frontiers to intervene in local hostilities.<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d128fn5">The President underlined “by military aid to intended

                    <p>—Trying to mitigate turbulence that lends itself to exploitation by the
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> and its proxies—e.g., by
                        intensified efforts to reach a settlement in the Middle East and by
                        providing <hi rend="italic">effective</hi> aid (which doesn’t necessarily
                        mean more money) for economic development in troubled areas of the
                        developing world. (C)</p>
                    <p>—Pushing ahead with the 3% real increase in defense expenditures.<note n="6"

                    <p>It also means (though you may not want to say this in your speech)
                        counter-pressures on the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>—e.g., not
                        being deterred by Soviet concerns from feasible improvement in our relations
                        with China. (C)</p>
                    <p>What is important, I repeat, is less specific measures, which will no doubt
                        be modified or discarded as events evolve, but a general shift in emphasis:
                        not a return to the cold war, but an adjustment of the balance between
                        competition and cooperation in response to recent Soviet behavior. You would
                        be signalling that we have read the Soviets’ signal and are sending an
                        equally clear one in return. We hope that it will be read; to the extent
                        that the Soviets respond by shifting away from competition toward
                        cooperation, we will be only too glad to do the same. (C)</p>

                    <p>All this will not get Soviet troops out of Cuba; I doubt anything will. But
                        it will show the American people that we have drawn the proper conclusions
                        from these troops’ presence and other Soviet actions, and are taking steps
                        to reflect these conclusions in the conduct of <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >US</gloss>-Soviet relations. (C)</p>
                    <p>Such a speech would be welcomed abroad. Last week in Paris, Art <persName
                            corresp="#p_HAA_1">Hartman</persName> told me that the French are
                        worried less about Cuba than by what they see as a generally assertive
                        Soviet policy in Third World areas. They would welcome a firmer <gloss

                        <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and its position in the world: Pushing

                            >US</gloss> at home; responding effectively to Soviet competition will
                        strengthen it abroad. Neither initiative will yield early results. But both
                        will strengthen the Administration’s standing, at home and abroad—indicating
                        that we have longer-term programs to help meet the problems that worry
                        Americans most. (C)</p>
                    <p>If you make the Soviet speech first, because of Cuba, you could indicate that
                        a second speech would soon follow, foreshadowing the domestic economic
                        programs that are also needed to maintain our national and international
                        strength. (C)</p>
                    <p>The second speech could not only announce your new campaign to boost
                        investment and productivity, but also rehearse the other elements of our
                        anti-inflationary strategy, emphasizing that prolonged fiscal and monetary
                        restraint is the key to success. This may not be a popular message, but the
                        leaders who have done best politically in the industrial countries
                            (<persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName>, Giscard, <gloss
                            target="#t_LDP_1">LDP</gloss> leaders in Japan) are those who have
                        proposed hard measures to beat inflation, while those who have done poorly
                            (<persName corresp="#p_TPE_1">Trudeau</persName>, Callaghan) have given
                        the impression of trying to please everyone.<note n="8" xml:id="d128fn8">The

                            sentence.</note> A President who tells it like it is, and thus is seen
                        to put the country’s interest over personal and political advantage, will
                        make anyone who argues for painless approaches to inflation look
                        second-rate. (C)</p>
                    <p>Once made, these two speeches should set the theme for the Administration’s
                        posture during the remainder of your first term. You should come back to
                        this theme at every occasion—stressing the need to strengthen our country,
                        and underlining the steps to improve pro<pb n="656" facs="0697"

                        needed to fulfill this task. You will be seen to be looking beyond specific
                        problems to a broad vision of the country’s future and the policies that are
                        needed to achieve it. This is what the much-abused term “leadership” means.

                            White House. The address was broadcast live on radio and television. The
                            Department transmitted the text of the speech to all diplomatic and
                            consular posts in telegram 258451, October 2. (National Archives, <gloss

                            recalled that the President had directed him to begin preparing the
                            speech in mid-September, “and I did so with special emphasis on the
                            wider character of Soviet activities in the Third World, stressing that
                            these were not compatible with a stable detente.” (<hi rend="italic"
                                >Power and Principle,</hi> p. 350) In his diary entry for the
                            weekend of September 29–30, the President recounted: “Because the issues
                            were so profoundly complicated—ourselves, Cuba, the Soviets, <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, Congress, politics—this has been
                            the most laborious speech preparation of my life.” After the address, he
                            offered the following assessment: “The speech went over well, and the
                            general result was exactly what we wanted: to defuse the Soviet troop
                            issue and let the nation realize the importance of <gloss

                        <hi rend="italic">Good evening.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>I want to talk with you about the subject that is my highest concern, as it
                        has been for every President. That subject is peace and the security of the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>We are at peace tonight, as we have been at peace throughout the time of my
                        service in this office. The peace we enjoy is the peace of the strong. Our
                        national defenses are unsurpassed in the world. Those defenses are stronger
                        tonight than they were 2 years ago, and they will be stronger 2 years from
                        now than they are tonight, because of carefully planned improvements that
                        are going forward with your support and with the support of the
                        Congress.</p>
                    <p>Our program for modernizing and strengthening the military forces of the
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Alliance is on track, with the
                        full cooperation and participation of our European Allies. Our strategic
                        nuclear forces are powerful enough to destroy any potential adversary many
                        times over, and the invulnerability of those forces will soon be further
                        assured by a new system of powerful mobile missiles. These systems are
                        designed for stability and defense.</p>
                    <p>Beyond these military defenses, we are on the threshold of a great advance in
                        the control of nuclear weapons—the adoption of the second strategic arms
                        limitation treaty, <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II.</p>
                    <p>This evening, I also want to report to you about the highly publicized Soviet
                        brigade in Cuba and about its bearing on the important relationship between
                        our Nation and the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>This is not a simple or easy subject. The United States and the Soviet Union
                        are the two most powerful nations on Earth, and the rela<pb n="658"
                            facs="0699" xml:id="pg_658"/>tionship between us is complex because it
                        involves strong elements of both competition and cooperation.</p>
                    <p>Our fundamental philosophies conflict; quite often, our national interests
                        conflict as well. As two great nations, we do have common interests and we
                        share an overwhelming mutual concern in preventing a nuclear war. We must
                        recognize therefore that nuclear arms control agreements are vital to both
                        our countries and that we must also exercise self-restraint in our relations
                        and be sensitive to each other’s concerns.</p>
                    <p>Recently, we obtained evidence that a Soviet combat brigade has been in Cuba
                        for several years.<note n="2" xml:id="d129fn2">See <ref target="#d125"
                                >Document 125</ref>.</note> The presence of Soviet combat troops in
                        Cuba is of serious concern to us.</p>
                    <p>I want to reassure you at the outset that we do not face any immediate,
                        concrete threat that could escalate into war or a major confrontation—but we
                        do face a challenge. It is a challenge to our wisdom—a challenge to our
                        ability to act in a firm, decisive way without destroying the basis for
                        cooperation that helps to maintain world peace and control nuclear weapons.
                        It’s a challenge to our determination to give a measured and effective
                        response to Soviet competition and to Cuban military activities around the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>Now, let me explain the specific problem of the Soviet brigade and describe
                        the more general problem of Soviet-Cuban military activism in the Third
                        World.</p>
                    <p>Here is the background on Soviet forces in Cuba: As most of you know, 17
                        years ago in the era of the cold war, the Soviet Union suddenly attempted to
                        introduce offensive nuclear missiles and bombers into Cuba. This direct
                        threat to the United States ended with the Soviet agreement to withdraw
                        those nuclear weapons and a commitment not to introduce offensive weapons
                        into Cuba thereafter.<note n="3" xml:id="d129fn3">See <ref

                    </p>
                    <p>At the time of that 1962 missile crisis, there were more than 20,000 Soviet
                        military personnel in Cuba. Most of them were withdrawn, and we monitored
                        their departure. It was believed that those who stayed behind were not
                        combat forces, but were there to advise and train Cubans and to perform
                        intelligence functions.</p>
                    <p>Just recently, American intelligence obtained persuasive evidence that some
                        of these Soviet forces had been organized into a combat unit. When attention
                        was then focused on a careful review of past intelligence data, it was
                        possible for our experts to conclude that this unit had <pb n="659"
                            facs="0700" xml:id="pg_659"/>existed for several years, probably since
                        the mid-1970’s, and possibly even longer.</p>
                    <p>This unit appears to be a brigade of two or three thousand men. It is armed
                        with about 40 tanks and other modern military equipment. It’s been organized
                        as a combat unit. Its training exercises have been those of a combat
                        unit.</p>
                    <p>This is not a large force, nor an assault force. It presents no direct threat
                        to us. It has no airborne or seaborne capability. In contrast to the 1962
                        crisis, no nuclear threat to the United States is involved.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, this Soviet brigade in Cuba is a serious matter. It contributes
                        to tension in the Caribbean and the Central American region. The delivery of
                        modern arms to Cuba and the presence of Soviet naval forces in Cuban waters
                        have strengthened the Soviet-Cuban military relationship. They’ve added to
                        the fears of some countries that they may come under Soviet or Cuban
                        pressure.</p>
                    <p>During the last few years, the Soviets have been increasing the delivery of
                        military supplies to Cuba. The result is that Cuba now has one of the
                        largest, best equipped armed forces in this region. These military forces
                        are used to intrude into other countries in Africa and the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>There’s a special relationship between Cuba and the Soviet Union. The Cubans
                        get their weapons free; other Soviet satellite countries have to pay for
                        their military supplies.</p>
                    <p>The Communist regime in Cuba is an economic failure that cannot sustain
                        itself. The Soviet Union must send to Cuba about $8 million in economic aid
                        every day.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_CRF_1">Fidel Castro</persName> does not pay money for
                        Soviet arms; the Cuban people pay a much higher price. In every
                        international dispute, on every international issue, the Cuban regime
                        automatically follows the Soviet line.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet brigade is a manifestation of Moscow’s dominance of Cuba. It
                        raises the level of that dominance, and it raises the level of
                        responsibility that the Soviet Union must take for escalating Cuban military
                        actions abroad.</p>
                    <p>Now, I want to report further on what we are doing to resolve these problems
                        and to counter these activities.</p>
                    <p>Over the past 3 weeks, we’ve discussed this issue at great length with top
                        Soviet officials.<note n="4" xml:id="d129fn4">For documentation on the oral

                    <p>The Soviet Union does not admit that the unit in question is a combat unit.
                        However, the Soviets have made certain statements to us with respect to our
                        concern: that the unit in question is a training center, that it does
                        nothing more than training and can do nothing more; that they will not

                        mean that they do not intend to enlarge the unit or to give it additional
                        capabilities.</p>
                    <p>They have said that the Soviet personnel in Cuba are not and will not be a

                        in the future. We, for our part, reconfirm this understanding.</p>
                    <p>These assurances have been given to me from the highest level of the Soviet
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>Although we have persuasive evidence that the unit has been a combat brigade,
                        the Soviet statements about the future noncombat status of the unit are
                        significant. However, we shall not rest on these Soviet statements
                        alone.</p>
                    <p>First, we will monitor the status of the Soviet forces by increased
                        surveillance of Cuba.</p>
                    <p>Second, we will assure that no Soviet unit in Cuba can be used as a combat
                        force to threaten the security of the United States or any other nation in
                        this hemisphere. Those nations can be confident that the United States will
                        act in response to a request for assistance to meet any such threat from
                        Soviet or Cuban forces.</p>
                    <p>This policy is consistent with our responsibilities as a member of the

                        troops from Cuba to move off the island of Cuba in an offensive action
                        against any neighboring countries.”<note n="7" xml:id="d129fn7">
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> addressed the American
                            Society of Newspaper Editors and took part in a question-and-answer
                            session at the Washington Statler Hilton Hotel on April 19, 1963. In
                            response to a statement made by a reporter that the American public felt
                            that the administration’s policy toward Cuba was one of “inaction,”
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> indicated that the
                            United States had “taken a good many actions” to contain Communism in
                            the Western Hemisphere. After outlining several of these actions, he
                            noted: “In addition, the United States maintains a constant
                            surveillance. We have indicated that we would not permit any troops from
                            Cuba to move off the island of Cuba in any offensive action against any
                            neighboring country. We have indicated also that we would not accept a
                            Hungary in Cuba, the use of Soviet troops against Cubans if there was
                            any internal reaction against <persName corresp="#p_CRF_1"

                    <p>Third, I’m establishing a permanent, full-time Caribbean joint task force
                        headquarters at Key West, Florida. I will assign to this headquarters,
                        forces from all the military services responsible for expanded planning and
                        for conducting exercises. This headquarters unit will employ designated
                        forces for action if required. This will substantially improve our
                        capability to monitor and to respond rapidly to any attempted military
                        encroachment in this region.</p>
                    <p>Fourth, we will expand military maneuvers in the region. We will conduct
                        these exercises regularly from now on. In accordance with existing treaty
                        rights, the United States will, of course, keep our forces in
                        Guantanamo.</p>
                    <p>Fifth, we will increase our economic assistance to alleviate the unmet
                        economic and human needs in the Caribbean region and further to ensure the
                        ability of troubled peoples to resist social turmoil and possible Communist
                        domination.</p>
                    <p>The United States has a worldwide interest in peace and stability.
                        Accordingly, I have directed the Secretary of Defense to further enhance the
                        capacity of our rapid deployment forces to protect our own interests and to
                        act in response to requests for help from our allies and friends. We must be
                        able to move our ground, sea, and air units to distant areas, rapidly and
                        with adequate supplies.</p>
                    <p>We have reinforced our naval presence in the Indian Ocean.</p>
                    <p>We are enhancing our intelligence capability in order to monitor Soviet and
                        Cuban military activities—both in Cuba and throughout the world. We will
                        increase our efforts to guard against damage to our crucial intelligence
                        sources and our methods of collection, without impairing civil and
                        constitutional rights.<note n="8" xml:id="d129fn8">See <ref

                    <p>These steps reflect my determination to preserve peace, to strengthen our
                        alliances, and to defend the interests of the United States. In developing

                        for them as President and as Commander in Chief.</p>
                    <p>I have concluded that the brigade issue is certainly no reason for a return
                        to the cold war. A confrontation might be emotionally satisfying for a few
                        days or weeks for some people, but it would be destructive to the national
                        interest and to the security of the United States.</p>
                    <p>We must continue the basic policy that the United States has followed for 20
                        years, under six administrations of both parties, a policy that recognizes
                        that we are in competition with the Soviet Union in some fields and that we
                        seek cooperation in others—notably maintaining the peace and controlling
                        nuclear arms.</p>
                    <p>My fellow Americans, the greatest danger to American security tonight is
                        certainly not the two or three thousand Soviet troops in Cuba. The greatest
                        danger to all the nations of the world—including the United States and the
                        Soviet Union—is the breakdown of a common effort to preserve the peace and
                        the ultimate threat of a nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>I renew my call to the Senate of the United States to ratify the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II treaty.</p>
                    <p>
                        <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II is a solid treaty. Ensuring
                        compliance with its terms will not be a matter of trust. We have highly
                        sophisticated, national technical means, carefully focused on the Soviet
                        Union, to ensure that the treaty is verifiable.</p>
                    <p>This treaty is the most important step ever taken to control strategic
                        nuclear arms. It permits us to strengthen our defense and to preserve the
                        strategic balance at lower risk and lower cost. During the past few years,
                        we have made real increases in our defense expenditures to fulfill the goals
                        of our 5-year defense plan. With <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II,
                        we can concentrate these increases in areas where our interests are most
                        threatened and where direct military challenge is most likely.</p>
                    <p>The rejection of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> would seriously
                        compromise our Nation’s peace and security.</p>
                    <p>Of course we have disagreements with the Soviets. Of course we have conflicts
                        with them. If we did not have these disagreements and conflicts, we would
                        not need a treaty to reduce the possibility of nuclear war between us.</p>
                    <p>If <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II is rejected, these disagreements
                        and conflicts could take on a new and ominous dimension. Against the
                        background of an uncontrolled nuclear arms race, every confrontation or
                        dispute would carry the seeds of a nuclear confrontation.</p>
                    <p>In addition, <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II is crucial to American
                        leadership and to the further strengthening of the Western Alliance.
                        Obviously, a secure Europe is vital to our own security. The leaders of our
                        European Allies support <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        II—unanimously. We’ve talked to a number of those <pb n="663" facs="0704"
                            xml:id="pg_663"/>leaders in the last few days. I must tell you tonight
                        that if the Senate fails to approve the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> treaty, these leaders and their countries would be
                        confused and deeply alarmed. If our allies should lose confidence in our
                        ability to negotiate successfully for the control of nuclear weapons, then
                        our effort to build a stronger and more united <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> could fail.</p>
                    <p>I know that for Members of Congress this is a troubling and a difficult
                        issue, in a troubling and difficult time. But the Senate has a tradition of
                        being the greatest deliberative body in the world, and the whole world is
                        watching the Senate today. I’m confident that all Senators will perform
                        their high responsibilities as the national interest requires.</p>
                    <p>Politics and nuclear arsenals do not mix. We must not play politics with the
                        security of the United States. We must not play politics with the survival
                        of the human race. We must not play politics with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> II. It is much too important for that—too vital to our
                        country, to our allies, and to the cause of peace.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II treaty and the
                        purpose of my actions in dealing with Soviet and Cuban military relationship
                        are exactly the same—to keep our Nation secure and to maintain a world at
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>As a powerful nation, as a super power, we have special responsibilities to
                        maintain stability even when there are serious disagreements among
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>We’ve had fundamental differences with the Soviet Union since 1917. I have no
                        illusions about these differences. The best way to deal with them
                        successfully is to maintain American unity, American will, and American
                        strength. That is what I am determined to do.</p>
                    <p>The struggle for peace—the long, hard struggle to make weapons of mass
                        destruction under control of human reason and human law—is a central drama
                        of our age.</p>
                    <p>At another time of challenge in our Nation’s history, President Abraham
                        Lincoln told the American people: “We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the
                        last best hope of earth.”<note n="10" xml:id="d129fn10">Reference is to

                    </p>
                    <p>We acted wisely then and preserved the Nation. Let us act wisely now and
                        preserve the world.</p>

                        To some, these ideals may seem at times to be old fashioned or outmoded. But
                        we’ve been clearly reminded in recent days that these principles mean just
                        as much to us now as they have ever meant during any time of critical
                        decision in the history of our Nation.</p>
                    <p>These fundamentals have old names to which we must continually give new
                        meaning—names like “strength,” “courage,” “patriotism,” “independence,” “the
                        love of freedom,” “human rights,” “justice,” “concern for the common
                        good.”</p>
                    <p>This is the 12th day that more than a hundred innocent human beings, some 60
                        of whom are members of the United States diplomatic mission, have been held
                        hostage in our Embassy in Iran. For a rare time in human history, a host
                        government has condoned and even encouraged this kind of illegal action
                        against a sovereign territory and official diplomatic relations of another
                        nation. This is an act of terrorism—totally outside the bounds of
                        international law and diplomatic tradition.</p>
                    <p>In this time of trial, our deep concern is for the lives of these brave
                        hostages, our Nation’s loyal citizens and faithful representatives. Every
                        American feels anger and outrage at what is happening to them, just as every
                        American feels concern for their safety and pride in their great courage.
                        This crisis calls for firmness, and it calls for restraint. And I’m proud
                        that this situation has brought forth calm leadership by officials and
                        private citizens throughout this country.</p>
                    <p>Firmness does require patience, and it requires perseverance. Firmness also
                        means measured action, deliberate actions that clarify the real issues,
                        reduce the likelihood of violence, protect our interests, and ensure
                        justice.</p>
                    <pb n="665" facs="0706" xml:id="pg_665"/>
                    <p>The United States has done nothing and will do nothing that could be used to
                        justify violent or imprudent action by anyone. While we are pursuing all
                        avenues of diplomatic resolution, we’re also acting unilaterally as
                        appropriate—with restraint, yes, but without hesitation.</p>
                    <p>First, in order to discourage violence and possible bloodshed here, which
                        when televised and transmitted back to Iran might threaten the safety of the
                        hostages, I’ve discouraged the issuing of permits for demonstrations on
                        Federal properties here in Washington. Consistent with our laws and pursuant
                        to my own powers and responsibilities, I have also encouraged local and
                        State officials to take similar legal action.</p>
                    <p>Second, I’ve directed our immigration authorities to review the visas of some
                        50,000 Iranian students, who are guests here in our country.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d130fn2">On November 10, the White House issued an announcement
                            directing <persName corresp="#p_CBR_1">Civiletti</persName> to identify
                            any Iranian students in the United States not in compliance with entry
                            visa requirements and begin deportation proceedings. In addition, the
                            President directed the Immigration and Naturalization Service to issue a
                            notice requiring Iranian students to report their present location and
                            status to local <gloss target="#t_INS_1">INS</gloss> offices. (Ibid., p.
                            2109)</note> Our Nation is fully committed to the enhancement of human
                        rights, the protection of legal rights, and the enhancement of civil
                        justice. All provisions of the United States Constitution will be honored.
                        All foreign nationals who are here lawfully may continue here with their
                        work or their studies. But those who are here illegally will be processed
                        promptly and lawfully for deportation back to their own country.</p>
                    <p>Third, I want to remove any question that our principles might be compromised
                        by our supposed need for Iranian oil. Early this week, therefore, I ordered
                        an immediate halt to any purchases or shipments of Iranian oil to the United
                        States of America.<note n="3" xml:id="d130fn3">In remarks to reporters made
                            in the Briefing Room at the White House the afternoon of November 12,
                            the President discussed this decision and indicated that he had directed
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCW_1">Duncan</persName> to collaborate with
                            Congress, other officials, and industry leaders to develop “new measures
                            to conserve oil” in light of the situation. (Ibid., p. 2110)
                            Proclamation 4702, issued by the President on November 12, codified the
                            discontinuance of oil purchases. For the text, see ibid., pp.
                            2110–2111.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I’m determined to make clear that we will never allow any foreign country to
                        dictate any American policy.</p>
                    <p>Fourth, in order to protect our economic interests and to ensure that claims
                        on Iran by the United States or by United States citizens are settled in an
                        orderly manner, we’ve legally frozen official Iranian property and financial
                            assets.<note n="4" xml:id="d130fn4">Executive Order 12170, issued on

                    <p>Yesterday I further instructed Secretary of State <persName
                            corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> and Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_MDF_1">McHenry</persName> to oppose any discussion of Iran’s
                        problems in the United Nations Security Council as long as American hostages
                        are being held.<note n="5" xml:id="d130fn5">
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> flew to New York the
                            morning of November 14 to obtain support for this position. (Bernard

                                Times,</hi> November 15, 1979, pp. A–1, A–16)</note> Only after the
                        hostages are released will we be willing to address Iran’s concerns and,
                        then, under the provisions of international law and under the charter of the
                        United Nations. The members of the United Nations Security Council, I am
                        pleased to announce to you, have agreed unanimously with our own
                        proposal.</p>
                    <p>It’s important for all of us to remember that we will not compromise our
                        fundamental principles of justice no matter how grave the provocation nor
                        how righteous our indignation. At the same time, we will continue to use our
                        influence around the world to obtain the same kinds of human rights for
                        people everywhere.</p>
                    <p>In this instance, we are upholding an important principle on behalf of the
                        entire world community. It’s a clear tenet of international law and
                        diplomatic tradition that the host government is fully responsible for the
                        safety and well-being of the property and the legal representatives of
                        another country. Less than a year ago—and this is a fact not generally known
                        or recognized—less than a year ago, 70,000 American citizens were in Iran.
                        As you know, thousands of people were killed during the upheavals there, but
                        almost miraculously and because of the good work of <persName
                            corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cyrus Vance</persName> and others, our people were
                        brought home safely. I thank God for it. Despite the turmoil, each
                        succeeding Iranian Government—and they were being changed, as you know,
                        quite rapidly—protected the citizens of other countries.</p>
                    <p>Foreign visitors are often vulnerable to abuse. An embassy is not a fortress.
                        There are no embassies anywhere in the world that can long withstand the
                        attack of a mob, if the mob has the support of the host government itself.
                        We had received repeated assurances of protection from the highest officials
                        in the Iranian Government, even a day or two before the mob was incited to
                        attack and before that protection was withdrawn at the last minute. The
                        principle of inviolability of embassies is understood and accepted by
                        nations everywhere, and it’s particularly important to smaller nations which
                        have no recourse to economic or military power. This is why the United
                        Nations Security Council has also unanimously supported our demand for the
                        release of the American hostages.</p>
                    <p>In accordance with this principle, as recognized and observed by all
                        civilized countries, the Iranian Government and its leaders are fully <pb
                            n="667" facs="0708" xml:id="pg_667"/>responsible for the safety and
                        well-being of our representatives in Iran, in Tehran, and they will be held
                        accountable for that responsibility. It is unthinkable that any responsible
                        government in today’s modern world could regard the seizure and the holding
                        of the diplomatic officials of another nation as a realistic means to
                        advance any cause whatsoever. Terrorism is not an acceptable means to
                        resolve disputes between individuals or between nations.</p>
                    <p>No act has so galvanized the American public toward unity in the last decade
                        as has the holding of our people as hostages in Tehran. We stand today as
                        one people. We are dedicated to the principles and the honor of our Nation.
                        We’ve taken no action which would justify concern among the people or among
                        the Government of Iran. We have done nothing for which any American need
                        apologize. The actions of Iranian leaders and the radicals who invaded our
                        Embassy were completely unjustified. They and all others must know that the
                        United States of America will not yield to international terrorism or to
                        blackmail.</p>
                    <p>These difficult days have reminded us of basic facts and principles which are
                        fundamental to the existence of us as a people. We will honor all
                        constitutional protections and international law and custom, and we will not
                        let our freedom and our security be jeopardized.</p>

                            Book II, pp. 2232–2237. The President spoke at 5 p.m. in the East Room
                            of the White House before members of the Business Council. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> sent a proposed speech
                            outline to the President under an October 17 cover memorandum,
                            requesting the President’s “reactions and guidance.” He indicated that
                            he and his staff planned to develop a draft for subsequent revision by
                            the President’s speechwriters, adding, “It is meant to be a serious
                            speech and not an exercise in oratory, and therefore I do want to focus
                            on substance above all.” <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> continued: “I think it would also be better
                            to keep plans for the speech restricted, because otherwise the exercise
                            will degenerate into ’group-think’ (like the Cuban brigade speech, which
                            at one time had as many as 14 people drafting it). It is impossible to
                            do a decent job in such a context.” The President wrote “Zbig,
                            ok—proceed. J” in the top right-hand corner of the memorandum. (Carter

                        <hi rend="italic">Chairman Reg Jones, members of the Business Council:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>It’s indeed a pleasure for me to be with you again. This afternoon I would
                        like to make a very important statement to you, following which the Chairman
                        and I will walk down the hall, and I’d like to greet each one of you
                        individually, as has been my custom in the past when we’ve been together.
                        And then we’ll have a chance for a few questions that you might want to put
                        to me concerning energy or inflation or legislation before the Congress or
                        Iran or other matters of interest to you.</p>
                    <p>But my first concern, and the first concern of every President who has ever
                        lived in this house, is and must be the security of our Nation. This
                        security rests on many kinds of strength, on arms and also on arms control,
                        on military power and on economic vitality and the quality of life of our
                        own people, on modern weapons, and also on reliable energy supplies. The
                        well-being of our friends and our allies is also of great importance to us.
                        Our security is tied to human rights and to social justice which prevails
                        among the people who live on Earth and to the institutions of international
                        force and peace and order, which we ourselves have helped to build.</p>
                    <p>We all hope and work and pray that we will see a world in which the weapons
                        of war are no longer necessary, but now we must deal with the hard facts,
                        with the world as it is. In the dangerous and uncertain world of today, the
                        keystone of our national security is still military strength, strength that
                        is clearly recognized by Americans, by our allies, and by any potential
                        adversary.</p>
                    <p>Twice in this century, each time in the aftermath of a global war, we were
                        tempted in this country by isolationism. The first time, we suc<pb n="669"
                            facs="0710" xml:id="pg_669"/>cumbed to that temptation, withdrawing from
                        our global responsibilities, and you know what the result was. A generation
                        later the world was again engulfed by war. But after the Second World War,
                        we built a national consensus, based on our own moral and political values,
                        around the concept of an active role for America in preserving peace and
                        security for ourselves and for others.</p>
                    <p>Despite all the changes that have swept across this world in the last 30
                        years, that basic consensus has endured. We’ve learned the mistake of
                        military intervention in the internal affairs of another country when our
                        own American security was not directly involved. But we must understand that
                        not every instance of the firm application of the power of the United States
                        is a potential Vietnam. The consensus for national strength and
                        international involvement, already shaken and threatened, survived that
                        divisive and tragic war.</p>
                    <p>Recent events in Iran have been a vivid reminder of the need for a strong and
                        United America, a nation which is supported by its allies and which need not
                        bluff or posture in the quiet exercise of our strength and in our continued
                        commitment to international law and the preservation of peace. Today,
                        regardless of other disagreements among ourselves, we are united in the
                        belief that we must have a strong defense and that military weakness would
                        inevitably make war more likely.</p>
                    <p>So, the issue we face is not whether we should be strong; the issue is how we
                        will be strong. What will be our defense responsibilities for the 1980’s and
                        beyond? What challenges must we confront in meeting those responsibilities?
                        What defense programs do we need, and how much will we spend to meet them?
                        How can we correlate most successfully our military readiness and our arms
                        control efforts? To begin with, our defense program must be tailored to
                        match our responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>In Europe our military forces have provided the foundation for one of the
                        longest periods of peace and prosperity that continent has ever enjoyed. Our
                        strength, both conventional and nuclear, helps to maintain peace while our
                        allies work together and build together through the European Community and
                        also nurture their historical ties to the countries of Eastern Europe. Our
                        mutual commitments within the Atlantic Alliance are vital to us all, and
                        those commitments are permanent and unshakable.</p>
                    <p>American military strength provides the framework within which our mature
                        friendships with Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and
                        Thailand all contribute to stability in the Pacific basin and throughout the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>The prospects for peace in the Middle East have been enhanced by a strong
                        America and by confidence in us among our friends in Egypt <pb n="670"
                            facs="0711" xml:id="pg_670"/>and in Israel. We are determined to
                        continue the progress which has been made in the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>We must and we will continue to meet these and our other responsibilities.
                        But there are reasons for concern about our ability to sustain our
                        beneficial and our peaceful influence throughout the world—real reasons for
                        concern.</p>
                    <p>For nearly 20 years now, the Soviet Union has been increasing its real
                        defense spending by 3 or 4 percent each year, 3 or 4 percent compounded
                        annually. In contrast, our own defense spending has declined in real terms
                        every year from 1968 through 1976. This is creating a real challenge to
                        American leadership and to our influence in the world.</p>
                    <p>We will almost certainly face other challenges, less direct, though no less
                        serious. The 1980’s are very likely to bring continued turbulence and
                        upheaval, as we’ve experienced in the 1970’s. Problems of energy price and
                        energy supply will continue to strain the economy of the developed world and
                        will put even more severe pressures on the developing nations. Political
                        instability, which is already serious enough, may even intensify as the
                        newer nations struggle to cope with these problems, which are serious enough
                        for us.</p>
                    <p>As in the past, when the winds of change threaten to arouse storms of
                        conflict, we must be prepared to join our friends and our allies in
                        resisting threats to stability and to peace.</p>
                    <p>The steady buildup by the Soviets and their growing inclination to rely on
                        military power to exploit turbulent situations call for calm, deliberate,
                        and sustained American response.</p>
                    <p>Through the mid-1970’s, the United States relied on the defense strategy and
                        also on force structures devised during the early 1960’s, a time when we
                        enjoyed strategic nuclear superiority and a tactical nuclear monopoly, when
                        Soviet seapower was limited and the Soviet military presence outside Eastern
                        Europe almost nonexistent. All that had changed by the time I took office as
                        President.</p>
                    <p>Beginning in 1976 and continuing in my own administration, we’ve set out to
                        counterbalance the growth in Soviet military power by launching new efforts
                        that draw on our own considerable strengths. During each of the last 4
                        years, there has been a moderate increase in real defense spending. In
                        Europe we’ve taken steps, as you know, to reverse a decade of relative
                        decline in the military strength of the Atlantic Alliance.</p>
                    <p>When I first began to meet with Atlantic Alliance leaders almost 3 years ago,
                        I found them very troubled by the state of our military strength in the
                        Atlantic Alliance. I promised to raise our own level of defense spending, in
                        real terms, by some 3 percent per year and our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> allies responded by making the same pledge. With American
                            <pb n="671" facs="0712" xml:id="pg_671"/>leadership, <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> also took the crucial step of adopting a
                        bold, long-term defense program, which will extend over 15 years.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d131fn2">See <ref target="#d90fn10">footnote 10, Document
                                90</ref>.</note> That program is helping us to increase our capacity
                        to deter or to defeat any surprise attack that may be launched against our
                        European allies and, therefore, against ourselves.</p>
                    <p>We are also taking steps to redress the balance in other theater nuclear
                        forces. This action, as you know, we’ve been pursuing in the last few
                        days.</p>
                    <p>In the early 1960’s, the United States removed its medium-range missiles from
                        Europe. We could do this then because there was overwhelming United States
                        strategic superiority. But the Soviet Union did not show similar restraint.
                        The accelerating development of their relatively long-range, mobile,
                        multiwarhead <gloss target="#t_SS20_1">SS–20</gloss> missile is a major
                        escalation in theater nuclear armaments. With the advent of rough strategic
                        parity, this new missile creates a potentially dangerous weakness in <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s ability to deter aggression. In the
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II negotiations, we carefully
                        protected our freedom to correct this weakness.</p>
                    <p>Just a few hours ago, I was informed that the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> Alliance resolved to strengthen its theater nuclear
                        weapons to offset actual Soviet deployments. The agreement reached this
                        afternoon in Europe was a unanimous agreement very encouraging to all of
                            us.<note n="3" xml:id="d131fn3">Reference is to the communiqué issued on
                            December 12 at a special meeting in Brussels of <gloss

                            I–A missiles. In addition, as part of <gloss target="#t_TNF_1"
                                >TNF</gloss> modernization, 1,000 U.S. nuclear warheads would be
                            withdrawn from Europe as soon as feasible. For the text of the
                            communiqué, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                            February 1980, p. 16.</note> Now, on the basis of strength, we can
                        negotiate with the Warsaw Pact to reduce nuclear weapons and also to reduce,
                        we hope, conventional weapons throughout the European theater.</p>
                    <p>In the area of intercontinental or strategic forces, we also face adverse
                        trends that must be corrected. Improved Soviet air defenses now threaten to
                        make our strategic bombers vulnerable. The cruise missile will be our
                        solution to that problem. Production of the first generation of air-launched
                        cruise missiles will begin next year.</p>
                    <p>In addition, our land-based Minuteman <gloss target="#t_ICBM_1"
                        >ICBM</gloss>’s are becoming increasingly vulnerable because of the improved
                        accuracy of the Soviet Union’s multiwarhead missiles. That’s why we decided
                        last spring to produce the MX missile.<note n="4" xml:id="d131fn4">See <ref
                                target="#d125">Document 125</ref>.</note> The relatively small
                        number of MX missiles to be deployed will have mobility and a large number
                        of shelters and will be far less vulnerable than our present fixed-shelter
                        Minutemen.</p>
                    <pb n="672" facs="0713" xml:id="pg_672"/>
                    <p>Further, in response to any first strike against us, the MX will have the
                        capability to attack a wide variety of Soviet military targets. The MX
                        missile, deployed as I’ve just described, will not undermine stability, but
                        it will deter attack and encourage negotiations on further nuclear arms
                        limits. In addition, by increasing the difficulty of any contemplated Soviet
                        strike, it will contribute to the survivability of our own strategic bombers
                        and submarines. Even with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, America
                        needs the MX to maintain the strategic nuclear balance.</p>
                    <p>We are also modernizing our strategic submarine force. The first new Trident
                        submarine has already been launched, and the first of our new Trident
                        missiles, with a range of more than 4,000 miles, have already been put to
                        sea.</p>
                    <p>Thus, each leg of our strategic triad is being modernized—cruise missiles for
                        our bombers, the MX for our intercontinental missiles, and Trident for our
                        undersea deterrent. Nor will we neglect our conventional forces, though here
                        we must rely heavily on the parallel efforts of our allies, in Asia as well
                        as in Europe. They must bear their proportional share of the increased costs
                        of a common defense.</p>
                    <p>I’m determined to keep our naval forces more powerful than those of any other
                        nation on Earth. Our shipbuilding program will sustain a 550-ship Navy in
                        the 1990’s, and we will continue to build the most capable ships afloat.
                        Seapower is indispensable to our global strategy, in peace and also in
                        war.</p>
                    <p>And finally, we are moving rapidly to counterbalance the growing ability of
                        the Soviet Union, directly or through surrogates, to use its military power
                        in Third World regions, and we must be prepared to deal with hostile actions
                        against our own citizens or our vital interests from others as well. For
                        this purpose, we need not only stronger forces but better means for rapid
                        deployment of the forces that we already have.</p>
                    <p>Our 1981 defense budget and our 5-year defense program will meet this need in
                        two different ways. The first will be a new fleet of maritime prepositioning
                        ships that will carry the heavy equipment and the supplies for three Marine
                        brigades that can be stationed in forward areas where United States forces
                        may be needed. With their supplies already near the scene of action, the
                        troops themselves can then be moved in by air very rapidly. The second
                        innovation will be a new fleet of large cargo aircraft to carry Army tanks
                        and other equipment over intercontinental distances. Having rapid deployment
                        forces does not necessarily mean that we will use them. We intend for their
                        existence to deter the very developments that would otherwise invoke their
                        use.</p>
                    <p>We must always remember that no matter how capable or advanced our weapons
                        systems, our military security depends on the abilities, the training, and
                        the dedication of the people who serve in our <pb n="673" facs="0714"
                            xml:id="pg_673"/>Armed Forces. I’m determined to recruit and to retain,
                        under any foreseeable circumstances, an ample level of such skilled and
                        experienced military personnel.</p>
                    <p>To sum up, the United States is taking strong action: first, to improve all
                        aspects of our strategic forces, thus assuring our deterrent to nuclear war;
                        second, to upgrade our forces in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and
                        in the Pacific, as part of a common effort with our allies; third, to
                        modernize our naval forces and keep them the best in the world; fourth, to
                        strengthen our rapid deployment capabilities to meet our responsibilities
                        outside <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>; and fifth, to maintain an
                        effective force of highly trained military personnel.</p>
                    <p>We must sustain these commitments in order to maintain peace and security in
                        the 1980’s. To ensure that we press forward vigorously, I will submit for
                        fiscal year 1981 a budget to increase funding authority for defense to more
                        than $157 billion, a real growth of more than 5 percent over my request for

                        outlays for defense during fiscal year 1981 will grow by more than 3
                        percent, in real terms, over the preceding year. We will sustain this
                        effort.</p>
                    <p>My 5-year defense program provides a real funding increase that will average
                        more than 4½ percent each year. I intend to carry out this program. With
                        careful and efficient management, we should be able to do so within the
                        budget increases I propose. If inflation increases or exceeds the projected
                        rates that we now expect, I intend to adjust the defense budget as needed,
                        just as has been done in 1980 fiscal year.</p>
                    <p>Much of this program which I’ve outlined to you will take 5 years or more to
                        reach fruition. The imbalances it will correct have been caused by more than
                        a decade of disparity. This cannot be remedied overnight, so we must be
                        willing to see this program through. To ensure that we do so, I’m setting a
                        growth rate for defense that will be tolerable for our country over the long
                        haul.</p>
                    <p>The most wasteful and self-defeating thing that we could do would be to start
                        this necessary program, then alter it or cut it back after a year or two
                        when such an action might become politically attractive. The defense program
                        that I’m proposing for the next 5 years will require some sacrifice—but
                        sacrifice that we can well afford. It will not increase at all the
                        percentage of our gross national product devoted to defense, which will
                        remain steady at almost exactly 5 percent per year.</p>
                    <p>We must have a long-range, balanced approach to the allocation of Federal
                        expenditures. We will continue to meet such crucial needs, of <pb n="674"
                            facs="0715" xml:id="pg_674"/>course, as jobs and housing and education
                        and health, but we must realize that a prerequisite to the enjoyment of such
                        progress is to assure peace for our Nation. So in asking congressional
                        support for our defense efforts, I’m asking for consistent support,
                        steadfast support—not just for 1980 or 1981, but until these commitments
                        have been fulfilled.</p>
                    <p>Sustained American strength is the only possible basis for the wider, truly
                        reciprocal détente which we seek with the Soviet Union. Only through
                        strength can we create global political conditions hospitable to worldwide
                        economic and political progress and to controlling both conventional and
                        nuclear weapons.</p>
                    <p>As the strongest, most advanced country on Earth, we have a special
                        obligation to seek security through arms control as well as through military
                        power. So, I welcome the debate by the Senate in its consideration of the
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II treaty. It will enable us to
                        build a clearer understanding that these efforts in both arms control and in
                        defense are vital to our security and they are mutually compatible, one with
                        another.</p>
                    <p>There are several reasons why <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II will
                        strengthen the military aspect of our national security:</p>
                    <p>First, we can better maintain strategic equivalence in nuclear weapons with
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II. Without it, the Soviet Union
                        can add more to the power of their own forces, widen any advantage that they
                        may achieve in the early 1980’s, and conceal from us what they are doing.
                        For us, maintaining parity with these uncontrollable Soviet activities would
                        add to our costs in time, money, and also uncertainty about our own
                        safety.</p>
                    <p>Second, we can better maintain the combat efficiency and readiness of our
                        non-nuclear forces with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II than we
                        can without it. Whatever the level of the defense budget, more of it will
                        have to go into strategic weapons, atomic weapons, if <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II is not ratified.</p>
                    <p>Third, we can better strengthen the unity, resolve, and capability of the
                            <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> Alliance with <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II than we can without it. That’s why
                        the heads of other <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> countries have
                        urged strongly its ratification.</p>
                    <p>Fourth, we can better continue the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        process, which has now been going on for more than 30 years, the process of
                        negotiating further reductions in the world’s nuclear arsenals, with <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II than without it. Without <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II and all its limits, its rules, and
                        definitions in place, any agreement in <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> III would, at the very best, take many more years to
                        achieve.</p>
                    <p>And finally, we can better control the proliferation of nuclear weapons among
                        currently non-nuclear nations with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II
                        than without it. This could be one of the most important factors involved in
                        our pending decision on the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>
                        treaty.</p>
                    <p>All of these issues are extremely important and they are intimately
                        interrelated. A strong defense is a matter of simple common sense; so is
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II.</p>

                    <p>I will do my utmost as President to keep America strong and to keep our
                        Nation secure, but this cannot be done without sustained effort and without
                        some sacrifice, which our Nation can certainly afford.</p>
                    <p>The best investment in defense is in weapons that will never have to be used
                        and in soldiers who will never have to die. But the peace we enjoy is the
                        fruit of our strength and our will to use this strength if we need to. As a
                        great nation devoted to peace, we must and we will continue to build that
                        American strength.<note n="6" xml:id="d131fn6">On the last page of the

                        have frequently protested Soviet actions (bases in Vietnam, Cubans abroad,
                        etc.). Since we have not always followed these verbal protests up with
                        tangible responses, the Soviets may be getting into the habit of
                        disregarding our concern. (C)</p>

                        the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. For additional information about this

                            >Reynolds</persName> devoted a portion of the interview to this
                        development:</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RF_1">Reynolds</persName>. Mr. President, you’ve
                        mentioned Afghanistan. Could you tell us what was Brezhnev’s response to
                        your message to him?</p>
                    <p>“The President. He responded in what I consider to be an inadequate way. He
                        claimed that he had been invited by the Afghan government to come in and
                        protect Afghanistan from some outside third nation threat. This was
                        obviously false. Because the person that he claimed invited him in,
                        President <persName corresp="#p_AH_1">Amin</persName>, was murdered or
                        assassinated after the Soviets pulled their coup.</p>
                    <p>“The leader that’s presently been imposed upon the Afghan people was
                        apparently brought in by the Soviet Union or either has not yet come into
                        Afghanistan—He’s not been seen since he was anointed to be the leader by the
                        Soviets and their cohorts in Afghanistan. He also claimed that they would
                        remove their forces from Afghanistan as soon as the situation should be
                        stabilized and the outside threat to Afghanistan was eliminated.</p>
                    <p>“So that was the tone of his message to me, which as I say, was completely
                        inadequate and completely misleading.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RF_1">Reynolds</persName>. Well, he’s lying, isn’t
                        he, Mr. President?</p>
                    <p>“The President. He’s not telling the facts accurately, that’s correct.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RF_1">Reynolds</persName>. Have you changed your
                        perceptions of the Russians in the time that you’ve been here? You started
                        out it seemed to a great many people believing that if you expressed your
                        good will and demonstrated it that they would reciprocate it.</p>
                    <p>“The President. My opinion of the Russians has changed most [<hi
                            rend="italic">more</hi>] drastically in the last week than even the
                        previous two and one-half years before that. It is only now dawning upon the
                        world that the magnitude of the action that the Soviets undertook in
                        invading Afghanistan. . . . This is a circumstance that I think is now
                        causing even former close friends and allies of the Soviet Union to
                        re-examine their opinion of what the Soviets might have in mind. . . . I
                        think it is imperative that within the next few days, after we consult with
                        one another that the leaders of the world make it clear to the Soviets that
                        they cannot have taken this action to violate world peace not only in that
                        region, but throughout the world without paying severe consequences. . .
                        .</p>
                    <p>“What we will do about it, I cannot say. But, to repeat myself, the action of
                        the Soviets has made a more dramatic change in my opinion <pb n="679"
                            facs="0720" xml:id="pg_679"/>of what the Soviets’ ultimate goals are
                        than anything they’ve done in the previous time that I’ve been in
                        office.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RF_1">Reynolds</persName>. But what we and the
                        other nations allied with us do will involve more than stiff notes of
                        protest . . . ?</p>
                    <p>“The President. Yes it will.</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RF_1">Reynolds</persName>. It will. Action will be
                        taken?</p>
                    <p>“The President. Yes.” (<hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Basic
                            Documents 1977–1980,</hi> Document 409) According to a transcript of the
                        interview published in <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi> on January
                        1, 1980, <persName corresp="#p_RF_1">Reynolds</persName> also asked the
                        President about the return of U.S. hostages in Iran, protection of broader
                        U.S. interests, and the difficult decisions facing the President. He
                        inquired as to whether or not the President would be forced to “make a
                        choice,” presumably regarding the rescue of the hostages. The President
                        responded:</p>
                    <p>“A. That’s an option that we have explored very thoroughly. Obviously we
                        cannot separate the safety of the 50 hostages from our long-term American
                        interests because they are intertwined. I don’t see any conflict between the
                        two and for us to peremptorily cause bloodshed or start a war in Iran and in
                        that entire Persian Gulf region just to show that I am brave or courageous
                        or forceful or powerful would be exactly the wrong thing to do for the
                        hostages and for our long-range interests. So I don’t see any conflict
                        between the two.” (“Transcript of President’s Interview on Soviet Reply,”
                        page 4)</p>
                    <p>In his diary entry for December 31, the President noted:</p>
                    <p>“I had a one-hour interview with <persName corresp="#p_RF_1">Frank
                            Reynolds</persName> of <gloss target="#t_ABC_1">ABC</gloss>. He’s going
                        to chop up the interview into four or five sections and broadcast them on
                        prime time the rest of the week. Jody thought the interview was great, and I
                        think it was a very good one.” (<hi rend="italic">White House Diary,</hi>

                        striking parallels with the present challenge we face in Afghanistan, in

                        the outer limits of American consciousness—Greece and Turkey. Communist
                        governments had been established with the aid of Soviet troops throughout
                        the Balkans. Greece was in the midst of a civil war, instigated in the main
                        by communist-led insurgents. Concurrently, Moscow was putting pressure on

                        influence of little or no strategic interest to the United States. Within
                        this country there was strong sentiment for a rapid U.S. disengagement from
                        all of Europe and a return to isolationism. <persName corresp="#p_THS_1"
                            >Truman</persName> was also under considerable pressure from a number of

                        undertake more strenuous efforts to cooperate with Moscow. (C)</p>
                    <p>Against this background, the United States received an urgent message in late

                        that was a startling enough idea at the time. They also were among the first
                        in the post World War II period to recognize the importance of buttressing
                        regional security and sending Moscow an unmistakable signal that the United
                        States was determined to protect not only old vital interests but new ones
                        as well, and to resist Soviet pressure. (U)</p>

                        <persName corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName>’s message was a turning point
                        in U.S. foreign policy. Specifically he:</p>

                    <p>This speech marked the beginning of one of the most creative periods of U.S.
                        diplomacy. Most importantly, it signalled the intention of the U.S. to
                        abandon its past hesitancy and to assume a more activist role
                        internationally. Without this rapid and resolute action on our part, the
                        Soviet Union would have continued to increase its pressure on Turkey and in
                        Greece, and the evolution of Southern Europe and the Middle East would
                        undoubtedly have been quite different. (U)</p>
                    <p>Today we face a Soviet challenge in an area of the world which is only a
                        little more unfamiliar to most Americans than were Greece and Turkey in
                        1947. As in 1947, the West looks to us because only we can provide the
                        necessary leadership and resources to turn back the Soviet threat to our
                        interests in the region and beyond. As in 1947, a U.S. public formerly weary
                        of war and international responsibility is in<pb n="682" facs="0723"

                        Soviet challenge in South Asia and the threat in 1947. The Soviet
                        intervention in the present case is both more blatant and more brutal than
                        in 1947, and the Gulf is unquestionably more vital to Western interests
                        today than were Greece and Turkey 30 years ago. (C)</p>

                    <p>The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan is the first time since 1945 that the
                        Soviet Union used its military forces directly to expand its power. This
                        took place even though we warned the Soviet Union of adverse consequences.

                        power with Soviet guns and tanks, with Soviet military power and assistance
                        (Vietnam, Angola, Laos, South Yemen, Cambodia, Ethiopia, and now probably
                        Afghanistan). Four of these takeovers occurred since January 1977.</p>
                    <p>I think it is clear that the Soviets have discounted our likely reaction and
                        that they have concluded that our previous expressions of concern need not
                        be heeded. In effect, because we did not overreact to their previous acts of
                        assertiveness, they have discounted the likelihood of a genuinely punitive
                        reaction on our part to this extraordinary application of Soviet military
                        power.</p>
                    <p>In the light of the foregoing, I would like to urge you to consider altering
                        our formula on arms for China from “we will not sell arms to <pb n="683"
                            facs="0724" xml:id="pg_683"/>China” to “we will not sell offensive arms

                            and <persName corresp="#p_DH_1">Donovan</persName> supported this

                                <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>: “The President
                            concluded that under the present circumstances it would suffice for
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName> to indicate to the
                            Chinese that the United States would be willing to provide China with
                            over-the-horizon radar and would give China more favored treatment in
                            trade than the Soviet Union, but that ’it would be a quantum leap to go
                            to arms sales’ at this time. It was better, he concluded, to leave that
                            option open.” (<hi rend="italic">Power and Principle,</hi> p.
                            431)</note> This shift in formulation would enable you to provide the
                        Chinese with the over-the-horizon radar and perhaps later with anti-tank
                        weaponry. Given the scale and the boldness of the Soviet move, these
                        reactions are both needed and hardly excessive. Moreover, they would
                        communicate tangibly our willingness to support those who are prepared to
                        stand up to the Soviets, and the Chinese are certainly in that category.</p>
                    <p>More broadly, we have to move deliberately to fashion a wider security
                        arrangement for the region, lest Soviet influence spread rapidly from
                        Afghanistan to Pakistan and Iran.<note n="4" xml:id="d135fn4">

                        cannot emphasize strongly enough the strategic consequences of such a

                    <p>The recommended subtle change in terminology, initiating a limited defense

                        effort in the region. You are already moving firmly on Pakistan, and I
                        believe the Congress will support you. We should implement rapidly your
                        decisions on new bases in the Indian Ocean/Gulf of Oman area, and survey

                    <p>Beyond the above, we will need an aid package for Pakistan, and that could be
                        expensive, though it might be shared with Saudi Arabia. Also, if we can
                        stiffen Pakistan’s back, we should be in a position to extend some aid to
                        the Afghani rebels, in order to keep the Soviets bogged down.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we need to do something to reassure the Egyptians, the Saudis, and
                        others on the Arabian peninsula that the U.S. is prepared to assert its
                        power, and that requires a visible military presence in the area now. You
                        might consider consulting with <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>

                        a major historical turning point has been reached. You have the opportunity

                    <p rend="center">Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan</p>
                    <p>I come to you this evening to discuss the extremely important and rapidly
                        changing circumstances in Southwest Asia.</p>
                    <p>I continue to share with all of you the sense of outrage and impatience
                        because of the kidnapping of innocent American hostages and the holding of
                        them by militant terrorists with the support and the approval of Iranian
                        officials. Our purposes continue to be the protection of the long-range
                        interests of our Nation and the safety of the American hostages.</p>
                    <p>We are attempting to secure the release of the Americans through the
                        International Court of Justice, through the United Nations, and through
                        public and private diplomatic efforts. We are determined to <pb n="685"
                            facs="0726" xml:id="pg_685"/>achieve this goal. We hope to do so without
                        bloodshed and without any further danger to the lives of our 50 fellow
                        Americans. In these efforts, we continue to have the strong support of the
                        world community. The unity and the common sense of the American people under
                        such trying circumstances are essential to the success of our efforts.</p>
                    <p>Recently, there has been another very serious development which threatens the
                        maintenance of the peace in Southwest Asia. Massive Soviet military forces
                        have invaded the small, nonaligned, sovereign nation of Afghanistan, which
                        had hitherto not been an occupied satellite of the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Fifty thousand heavily armed Soviet troops have crossed the border and are
                        now dispersed throughout Afghanistan, attempting to conquer the fiercely
                        independent Muslim people of that country.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets claim, falsely, that they were invited into Afghanistan to help
                        protect that country from some unnamed outside threat. But the President,
                        who had been the leader of Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion, was
                        assassinated—along with several members of his family—after the Soviets
                        gained control of the capital city of Kabul. Only several days later was the
                        new puppet leader even brought into Afghanistan by the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>This invasion is an extremely serious threat to peace because of the threat
                        of further Soviet expansion into neighboring countries in Southwest Asia and
                        also because such an aggressive military policy is unsettling to other
                        peoples throughout the world.</p>
                    <p>This is a callous violation of international law and the United Nations
                        Charter. It is a deliberate effort of a powerful atheistic government to
                        subjugate an independent Islamic people.</p>
                    <p>We must recognize the strategic importance of Afghanistan to stability and
                        peace. A Soviet-occupied Afghanistan threatens both Iran and Pakistan and is
                        a steppingstone to possible control over much of the world’s oil
                        supplies.</p>
                    <p>The United States wants all nations in the region to be free and to be
                        independent. If the Soviets are encouraged in this invasion by eventual
                        success, and if they maintain their dominance over Afghanistan and then
                        extend their control to adjacent countries, the stable, strategic, and
                        peaceful balance of the entire world will be changed. This would threaten
                        the security of all nations including, of course, the United States, our
                        allies, and our friends.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, the world simply cannot stand by and permit the Soviet Union to
                        commit this act with impunity. Fifty nations have petitioned the United
                        Nations Security Council to condemn the Soviet Union and to demand the
                        immediate withdrawal of all Soviet troops from Afghanistan. We realize that
                        under the United Nations Charter the Soviet <pb n="686" facs="0727"
                            xml:id="pg_686"/>Union and other permanent members may veto action of
                        the Security Council. If the will of the Security Council should be thwarted
                        in this manner, then immediate action would be appropriate in the General
                        Assembly of the United Nations, where no Soviet veto exists.<note n="2"

                        committed to world peace and stability can continue to do business as usual

                    <p>However, because of the Soviet aggression, I have asked the United States

                            is important irrespective of the tone of our relationship with the

                                corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName> expressed his opposition to
                            reducing grain sales to the Soviet Union, noting that it benefited the
                            United States to continue these sales and maintain the Soviet market.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName> conceded that if the
                            President had to take action on grain, he should cancel the agreement
                            for sales in excess of those already contracted. After summarizing the
                            steps the administration had taken and noting that they constituted a
                            “most significant response” to the invasion, <persName

                            have to make this decision without regard to politics.” However, he
                            stated the impact that such a decision might have on commodity prices
                            and farmer support for the administration, continuing: “Because of that,
                            this decision could undermine your ability to persevere in a strong and
                            unified assault upon the Soviet Union with a unified nation behind you.
                            To me, there is something particularly grubby about using food as a
                            weapon and the use of it could damage us in the international community
                            as well. I might also point out that we did not use the food weapon in
                            the case of the holding of American hostages and I believe to do so now
                            would also raise questions as to how the differences in policy might be
                            justified. I try very hard not to be a hair shirt for you, but I feel
                            very strongly about this matter and have therefore written this memo.”

                        this action.<note n="7" xml:id="d136fn7">During a January 5 news conference,

                            supported the President’s decision and noted that the President had
                            instructed him to take steps to “protect farmers’ income.” He commented:
                            “We have consistently said that food should not be used as a weapon
                            because as a general rule food assistance goes to people who are poor
                            and hungry and defenseless. But in this instance, we are talking about
                            the Soviet government. The two are not the same. The Soviet Union has
                            invaded by armed aggression a country—an independent, free-standing
                            state. The President had a choice to make. Do we sit idly by and
                            continue to accommodate the Soviet’s whims and demands? Or do we say no,
                            we’re not going to simply conduct business as usual? He took the proper
                            action. I support him and I think ultimately the farmers and other
                            citizens of the country will support the President in this enterprise.”

                        of the use of grain for gasohol production here at home.</p>
                    <p>After consultation with other principal grain-exporting nations, I am
                        confident that they will not replace these quantities of grain by additional
                        shipments on their part to the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>These actions will require some sacrifice on the part of all Americans, but
                        there is absolutely no doubt that these actions are in the interest of world
                        peace and in the interest of the security of our own Nation, and they are
                        also compatible with actions being taken by our own major trading partners
                        and others who share our deep concern about this new Soviet threat to world
                        stability.</p>
                    <p>Although the United States would prefer not to withdraw from the Olympic
                        games scheduled in Moscow this summer, the Soviet Union must realize that
                        its continued aggressive actions will endanger both the participation of
                        athletes and the travel to Moscow by spectators who would normally wish to
                        attend the Olympic games.</p>
                    <p>Along with other countries, we will provide military equipment, food, and
                        other assistance to help Pakistan defend its independence and its national
                        security against the seriously increased threat it now faces from the north.
                        The United States also stands ready to help other nations in the region in
                        similar ways.</p>
                    <p>Neither our allies nor our potential adversaries should have the slightest
                        doubt about our willingness, our determination, and our capacity to take the
                        measures I have outlined tonight. I have consulted with leaders of the
                        Congress, and I am confident they will support legislation that may be
                        required to carry out these measures.</p>
                    <p>History teaches, perhaps, very few clear lessons. But surely one such lesson
                        learned by the world at great cost is that aggression, unopposed, becomes a
                        contagious disease.</p>

                    <p>The response of the international community to the Soviet attempt to crush
                        Afghanistan must match the gravity of the Soviet action.</p>
                    <p>With the support of the American people and working with other nations, we
                        will deter aggression, we will protect our Nation’s security, and we will
                        preserve the peace. The United States will meet its responsibilities.</p>

                            corresp="#p_BZK_1">Zbigniew Brzezinski</persName> took part in a
                        briefing for non-Washington editorial page editors and writers on January 8,
                        1980. The briefing took place from 11:36 a.m. to 12:01 p.m. in the Old
                        Executive Office Building. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                            >Brzezinski</persName> initiated the session by stating:</p>
                    <p>“I thought that it might be most useful if I were to open with a few little
                        comments, and then perhaps respond to any questions that you may wish to
                        raise. We are obviously going through a very serious beginning for the new
                        decade. Perhaps, however, it is not only symbolic that these events are
                        taking place in the first year of the 1980s.</p>
                    <p>“We have entered the fifth decade of U.S.-Soviet competition. I think it is
                        useful to think about that, particularly for you, since you are editorial
                        writers, in an historical perspective. The decade of the ’40s was the decade
                        of U.S. entrance into world affairs, and of Soviet expansion because of the
                        vacuum that developed as a consequence of World War Two.</p>
                    <p>“The decade of the ’50s brought the definition of clear lines in the West and
                        in the Far East; Berlin and Korea; and obviously I am oversimplifying here.
                        The decade of the ’60s was that premature global competition, with the
                        Soviets, under <persName corresp="#p_KN_2">Khrushchev</persName>, moving out
                        too abruptly and without sufficient power base, resulting in the conflict in
                        Cuba and the respite for the United States, this shaken by the U.S.
                        involvement in Vietnam.</p>
                    <p>“The decade of the ’70s was the decade of Soviet build-up, but also
                        accommodation; the search for a more enduring cooperative relationship. What
                        will the decade of the ’80s be? That is the central issue now confronting
                        us. And that is the issue which is at stake in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>“It can also be a decade of cooperation, not only under arms control but over
                        the wider issues that should concern too much U.S. global <pb n="690"
                            facs="0731" xml:id="pg_690"/>power—global cooperation and so forth. It
                        can, however, also be a decade of conflict, of conflict arising out of the
                        new reality of overlapping imperial power. For the first time, not only is
                        American power global but Soviet power is becoming global.</p>
                    <p>“The President takes a very serious view of the Soviet action in Afghanistan
                        because it is an exercise of power outside of the established perimeters,
                        whatever the moral justification, drawn as a consequence of World War Two.
                        It is the first time that Soviet military forces have been used beyond the
                        lines that were drawn historically by May, 1945. And they are being used,
                        also, not against a country engaged in the East-West conflict, but a
                        neutral, non-aligned country.</p>
                    <p>“We have undertaken a response to this action of Soviet intervention and
                        aggression. That response is designed to be punitive and also to be a
                        warning. That response requires national support. I do hope, I expect, that
                        it will be forthcoming, because I think the American people realize that
                        there are important issues involved. That response will be a sustained one.
                        It is not a flash in the pan.</p>
                    <p>“But beyond that, as a nation, and U.S. opinion-makers, we have to think
                        about not only responding to the act, but also of responding to the
                        consequences of the act. The consequences of the act are regional and
                        strategic in nature, and not local and limited; they are regional and
                        strategic in nature. They do involve the stability of the region, which is
                        potentially of vital importance to us, and to those who are of vital
                        importance to us.</p>
                    <p>“And this is why we are confronted with a problem which in some respects
                        bears historical analogy to the challenge that President <persName
                            corresp="#p_THS_1">Truman</persName> confronted when, in the late winter
                        of 1947, he was abruptly informed that he had six weeks in which to decide
                        whether to replace the British as the stabilizing ally for two wobbly,
                        internally-ruled, highly-vulnerable countries remote from the United States
                        by distance and culture: Turkey and Greece. These were countries much
                        further from us geographically then than are Pakistan and Iran today.</p>
                    <p>“So this is the perspective which I would like to share with you on a problem
                        which is a serious one, and which requires a great deal of national
                        attention, which calls for a very mature and responsible response, which we
                        do not view as a subject that requires a debate, but rather a serious
                        national commitment.</p>
                    <p>“It is useful in this context to be reminded that this is not, this is the
                        Soviet Union—this is part of a process which has involved us now over four
                        decades. Perhaps that is enough by way of a very broad connection. Perhaps I
                        can now respond to more specific points. And I would appreciate it if you
                        would identify yourselves, because I don’t know who you are, and maybe your
                        colleagues don’t know.”</p>
                    <pb n="691" facs="0732" xml:id="pg_691"/>
                    <p> then responded to questions concerning Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, and
                        India. He concluded his remarks by thanking the participants, adding:</p>
                    <p>“I wish this could go on longer because we are dealing here with some vital
                        issues. But I wish you well. And I think particularly at this time it is
                        terribly important that the American public, through you, look at the
                        problems we face in a realistic way—but also not in an overly dramatized
                        fashion. I think what they have to understand is that this is a long haul
                        proposition. The competition has lasted for 40 years; it is not going to end
                        quickly; there are not going to be victors or losers in it very quickly,
                        unless we fold up entirely, which we do not intend to do.” (Carter Library,

                        the state of the world. And tonight, as throughout our own generation,
                        freedom and peace in the world depend on the state of our Union.</p>
                    <p>The 1980’s have been born in turmoil, strife, and change. This is a time of
                        challenge to our interests and our values and it’s a time that tests our
                        wisdom and our skills.</p>
                    <pb n="692" facs="0733" xml:id="pg_692"/>
                    <p>At this time in Iran, 50 Americans are still held captive, innocent victims
                        of terrorism and anarchy. Also at this moment, massive Soviet troops are
                        attempting to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply religious people
                        of Afghanistan. These two acts—one of international terrorism and one of
                        military aggression—present a serious challenge to the United States of
                        America and indeed to all the nations of the world. Together, we will meet
                        these threats to peace.</p>
                    <p>I’m determined that the United States will remain the strongest of all
                        nations, but our power will never be used to initiate a threat to the
                        security of any nation or to the rights of any human being. We seek to be
                        and to remain secure—a nation at peace in a stable world. But to be secure
                        we must face the world as it is.</p>
                    <p>Three basic developments have helped to shape our challenges: the steady
                        growth and increased projection of Soviet military power beyond its own
                        borders; the overwhelming dependence of the Western democracies on oil
                        supplies from the Middle East; and the press of social and religious and
                        economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world,
                        exemplified by the revolution in Iran.</p>
                    <p>Each of these factors is important in its own right. Each interacts with the
                        others. All must be faced together, squarely and courageously. We will face
                        these challenges, and we will meet them with the best that is in us. And we
                        will not fail.</p>
                    <p>In response to the abhorrent act in Iran, our Nation has never been aroused
                        and unified so greatly in peacetime. Our position is clear. The United
                        States will not yield to blackmail.</p>
                    <p>We continue to pursue these specific goals: first, to protect the present and
                        long-range interests of the United States; secondly, to preserve the lives
                        of the American hostages and to secure, as quickly as possible, their safe
                        release, if possible, to avoid bloodshed which might further endanger the
                        lives of our fellow citizens; to enlist the help of other nations in
                        condemning this act of violence, which is shocking and violates the moral
                        and the legal standards of a civilized world; and also to convince and to
                        persuade the Iranian leaders that the real danger to their nation lies in
                        the north, in the Soviet Union and from the Soviet troops now in
                        Afghanistan, and that the unwarranted Iranian quarrel with the United States
                        hampers their response to this far greater danger to them.</p>
                    <p>If the American hostages are harmed, a severe price will be paid. We will
                        never rest until every one of the American hostages are released.</p>
                    <p>But now we face a broader and more fundamental challenge in this region
                        because of the recent military action of the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Now, as during the last 3½ decades, the relationship between our country, the
                        United States of America, and the Soviet Union is the most <pb n="693"
                            facs="0734" xml:id="pg_693"/>critical factor in determining whether the
                        world will live at peace or be engulfed in global conflict.</p>
                    <p>Since the end of the Second World War, America has led other nations in
                        meeting the challenge of mounting Soviet power. This has not been a simple
                        or a static relationship. Between us there has been cooperation, there has
                        been competition, and at times there has been confrontation.</p>
                    <p>In the 1940’s we took the lead in creating the Atlantic Alliance in response
                        to the Soviet Union’s suppression and then consolidation of its East
                        European empire and the resulting threat of the Warsaw Pact to Western
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>In the 1950’s we helped to contain further Soviet challenges in Korea and in
                        the Middle East, and we rearmed to assure the continuation of that
                        containment.</p>
                    <p>In the 1960’s we met the Soviet challenges in Berlin, and we faced the Cuban
                        missile crisis. And we sought to engage the Soviet Union in the important
                        task of moving beyond the cold war and away from confrontation.</p>
                    <p>And in the 1970’s three American Presidents negotiated with the Soviet
                        leaders in attempts to halt the growth of the nuclear arms race. We sought
                        to establish rules of behavior that would reduce the risks of conflict, and
                        we searched for areas of cooperation that could make our relations
                        reciprocal and productive, not only for the sake of our two nations but for
                        the security and peace of the entire world.</p>
                    <p>In all these actions, we have maintained two commitments: to be ready to meet
                        any challenge by Soviet military power, and to develop ways to resolve
                        disputes and to keep the peace.</p>
                    <p>Preventing nuclear war is the foremost responsibility of the two superpowers.
                        That’s why we’ve negotiated the strategic arms limitation treaties—<gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> I and <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> II. Especially now, in a time of great tension, observing
                        the mutual constraints imposed by the terms of these treaties will be in the
                        best interest of both countries and will help to preserve world peace. I
                        will consult very closely with the Congress on this matter as we strive to
                        control nuclear weapons. That effort to control nuclear weapons will not be
                        abandoned.</p>
                    <p>We superpowers also have the responsibility to exercise restraint in the use
                        of our great military force. The integrity and the independence of weaker
                        nations must not be threatened. They must know that in our presence they are
                        secure.</p>
                    <p>But now the Soviet Union has taken a radical and an aggressive new step. It’s
                        using its great military power against a relatively defenseless nation. The
                        implications of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan <pb n="694" facs="0735"
                            xml:id="pg_694"/>could pose the most serious threat to the peace since
                        the Second World War.</p>
                    <p>The vast majority of nations on Earth have condemned this latest Soviet
                        attempt to extend its colonial domination of others and have demanded the
                        immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops. The Moslem world is especially and
                        justifiably outraged by this aggression against an Islamic people. No action
                        of a world power has ever been so quickly and so overwhelmingly condemned.
                        But verbal condemnation is not enough. The Soviet Union must pay a concrete
                        price for their aggression.</p>
                    <p>While this invasion continues, we and the other nations of the world cannot
                        conduct business as usual with the Soviet Union. That’s why the United
                        States has imposed stiff economic penalties on the Soviet Union.<note n="3"

                        products. I’ve limited other commerce with the Soviet Union, and I’ve asked
                        our allies and friends to join with us in restraining their own trade with
                        the Soviets and not to replace our own embargoed items. And I have notified
                        the Olympic Committee that with Soviet invading forces in Afghanistan,
                        neither the American people nor I will support sending an Olympic team to

                    </p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union is going to have to answer some basic questions: Will it
                        help promote a more stable international environment in which its own
                        legitimate, peaceful concerns can be pursued? Or will it continue to expand
                        its military power far beyond its genuine security needs, and use that power
                        for colonial conquest? The Soviet Union must realize that its decision to
                        use military force in Afghanistan will be costly to every political and
                        economic relationship it values.</p>
                    <p>The region which is now threatened by Soviet troops in Afghanistan is of
                        great strategic importance: It contains more than two-thirds of the world’s
                        exportable oil. The Soviet effort to dominate Afghanistan has brought Soviet
                        military forces to within 300 miles of the Indian Ocean and close to the
                        Straits of Hormuz, a waterway through which <pb n="695" facs="0736"
                            xml:id="pg_695"/>most of the world’s oil must flow. The Soviet Union is
                        now attempting to consolidate a strategic position, therefore, that poses a
                        grave threat to the free movement of Middle East oil.</p>
                    <p>This situation demands careful thought, steady nerves, and resolute action,
                        not only for this year but for many years to come. It demands collective
                        efforts to meet this new threat to security in the Persian Gulf and in
                        Southwest Asia. It demands the participation of all those who rely on oil
                        from the Middle East and who are concerned with global peace and stability.
                        And it demands consultation and close cooperation with countries in the area
                        which might be threatened.</p>
                    <p>Meeting this challenge will take national will, diplomatic and political
                        wisdom, economic sacrifice, and, of course, military capability. We must
                        call on the best that is in us to preserve the security of this crucial
                        region.</p>
                    <p>Let our position be absolutely clear: An attempt by any outside force to gain
                        control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the
                        vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be
                        repelled by any means necessary, including military force.</p>
                    <p>During the past 3 years, you have joined with me to improve our own security
                        and the prospects for peace, not only in the vital oil-producing area of the
                        Persian Gulf region but around the world. We’ve increased annually our real
                        commitment for defense, and we will sustain this increase of effort
                        throughout the Five Year Defense Program. It’s imperative that Congress
                        approve this strong defense budget for 1981, encompassing a 5-percent real
                        growth in authorizations, without any reduction.</p>
                    <p>We are also improving our capability to deploy U.S. military forces rapidly
                        to distant areas. We’ve helped to strengthen <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> and our other alliances, and recently we and other <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> members have decided to develop and to
                        deploy modernized, intermediate-range nuclear forces to meet an unwarranted
                        and increased threat from the nuclear weapons of the Soviet Union.<note

                    <p>We are working with our allies to prevent conflict in the Middle East. The
                        peace treaty between Egypt and Israel is a notable achievement which
                        represents a strategic asset for America and which also enhances prospects
                        for regional and world peace. We are now engaged in further negotiations to
                        provide full autonomy for the people of the West Bank and Gaza, to resolve
                        the Palestinian issue in all its aspects, and to preserve the peace and
                        security of Israel. Let no one doubt our commitment to the security of
                        Israel. In a few days we will observe an <pb n="696" facs="0737"

                        with other nations in the region. We believe that there are no
                        irreconcilable differences between us and any Islamic nation. We respect the

                    <p>Finally, we are prepared to work with other countries in the region to share
                        a cooperative security framework that respects differing <pb n="697"
                            facs="0738" xml:id="pg_697"/>values and political beliefs, yet which
                        enhances the independence, security, and prosperity of all.</p>
                    <p>All these efforts combined emphasize our dedication to defend and preserve
                        the vital interests of the region and of the nation which we represent and
                        those of our allies—in Europe and the Pacific, and also in the parts of the
                        world which have such great strategic importance to us, stretching
                        especially through the Middle East and Southwest Asia. With your help, I
                        will pursue these efforts with vigor and with determination. You and I will
                        act as necessary to protect and to preserve our Nation’s security.</p>
                    <p>The men and women of America’s Armed Forces are on duty tonight in many parts
                        of the world. I’m proud of the job they are doing, and I know you share that
                        pride. I believe that our volunteer forces are adequate for current defense
                        needs, and I hope that it will not become necessary to impose a draft.
                        However, we must be prepared for that possibility. For this reason, I have
                        determined that the Selective Service System must now be revitalized. I will
                        send legislation and budget proposals to the Congress next month so that we
                        can begin registration and then meet future mobilization needs rapidly if

                    </p>
                    <p>We also need clear and quick passage of a new charter to define the legal
                        authority and accountability of our intelligence agencies. We will guarantee
                        that abuses do not recur, but we must tighten our controls on sensitive
                        intelligence information, and we need to remove unwarranted restraints on
                        America’s ability to collect intelligence.</p>
                    <p>The decade ahead will be a time of rapid change, as nations everywhere seek
                        to deal with new problems and age-old tensions. But America need have no
                        fear. We can thrive in a world of change if we remain true to our values and
                        actively engaged in promoting world peace. We will continue to work as we
                        have for peace in the Middle East and southern Africa. We will continue to
                        build our ties with developing nations, respecting and helping to strengthen
                        their national independence which they have struggled so hard to achieve.
                        And we will continue to support the growth of democracy and the protection
                        of human rights.</p>
                    <p>In repressive regimes, popular frustrations often have no outlet except
                        through violence. But when peoples and their governments can approach their
                        problems together through open, democratic methods, the basis for stability
                        and peace is far more solid and far more enduring. <pb n="698" facs="0739"
                            xml:id="pg_698"/>That is why our support for human rights in other
                        countries is in our own national interest as well as part of our own
                        national character.</p>
                    <p>Peace—a peace that preserves freedom—remains America’s first goal. In the
                        coming years, as a mighty nation we will continue to pursue peace. But to be
                        strong abroad we must be strong at home. And in order to be strong, we must
                        continue to face up to the difficult issues that confront us as a nation
                        today.</p>
                    <p>The crises in Iran and Afghanistan have dramatized a very important lesson:
                        Our excessive dependence on foreign oil is a clear and present danger to our
                        Nation’s security. The need has never been more urgent. At long last, we
                        must have a clear, comprehensive energy policy for the United States.</p>
                    <p>As you well know, I have been working with the Congress in a concentrated and
                        persistent way over the past 3 years to meet this need. We have made
                        progress together. But Congress must act promptly now to complete final
                        action on this vital energy legislation.<note n="11" xml:id="d138fn11"
                            >Reference is to the Energy Security Act (<gloss target="#t_PL_1"

                            which the President signed on June 30.</note> Our Nation will then have
                        a major conservation effort, important initiatives to develop solar power,
                        realistic pricing based on the true value of oil, strong incentives for the
                        production of coal and other fossil fuels in the United States, and our
                        Nation’s most massive peacetime investment in the development of synthetic
                        fuels.</p>
                    <p>The American people are making progress in energy conservation. Last year we
                        reduced overall petroleum consumption by 8 percent and gasoline consumption
                        by 5 percent below what it was the year before. Now we must do more.</p>
                    <p>After consultation with the Governors, we will set gasoline conservation
                        goals for each of the 50 States, and I will make them mandatory if these
                        goals are not met.</p>
                    <p>I’ve established an import ceiling for 1980 of 8.2 million barrels a day—well
                        below the level of foreign oil purchases in 1977. I expect our imports to be
                        much lower than this, but the ceiling will be enforced by an oil import fee
                        if necessary. I’m prepared to lower these imports still further if the other
                        oil-consuming countries will join us in a fair and mutual reduction. If we
                        have a serious shortage, I will not hesitate to impose mandatory gasoline
                        rationing immediately.</p>
                    <p>The single biggest factor in the inflation rate last year, the increase in
                        the inflation rate last year, was from one cause: the skyrocketing prices of
                            <gloss target="#t_OPEC_1">OPEC</gloss> oil. We must take whatever
                        actions are necessary to reduce our dependence on foreign oil—and at the
                        same time reduce inflation.</p>
                    <pb n="699" facs="0740" xml:id="pg_699"/>
                    <p>As individuals and as families, few of us can produce energy by ourselves.
                        But all of us can conserve energy—every one of us, every day of our lives.
                        Tonight I call on you—in fact, all the people of America—to help our Nation.
                        Conserve energy. Eliminate waste. Make 1980 indeed a year of energy
                        conservation.</p>
                    <p>Of course, we must take other actions to strengthen our Nation’s economy.</p>
                    <p>First, we will continue to reduce the deficit and then to balance the Federal
                        budget.</p>
                    <p>Second, as we continue to work with business to hold down prices, we’ll build
                        also on the historic national accord with organized labor to restrain pay
                        increases in a fair fight against inflation.</p>
                    <p>Third, we will continue our successful efforts to cut paperwork and to
                        dismantle unnecessary Government regulation.</p>
                    <p>Fourth, we will continue our progress in providing jobs for America,
                        concentrating on a major new program to provide training and work for our
                        young people, especially minority youth. It has been said that “a mind is a
                        terrible thing to waste.” We will give our young people new hope for jobs
                        and a better life in the 1980’s.</p>
                    <p>And fifth, we must use the decade of the 1980’s to attack the basic
                        structural weaknesses and problems in our economy through measures to
                        increase productivity, savings, and investment.</p>
                    <p>With these energy and economic policies, we will make America even stronger
                        at home in this decade—just as our foreign and defense policies will make us
                        stronger and safer throughout the world. We will never abandon our struggle
                        for a just and a decent society here at home. That’s the heart of
                        America—and it’s the source of our ability to inspire other people to defend
                        their own rights abroad.</p>
                    <p>Our material resources, great as they are, are limited. Our problems are too
                        complex for simple slogans or for quick solutions. We cannot solve them
                        without effort and sacrifice. Walter Lippmann once reminded us, “You took
                        the good things for granted. Now you must earn them again. For every right
                        that you cherish, you have a duty which you must fulfill. For every good
                        which you wish to preserve, you will have to sacrifice your comfort and your
                        ease. There is nothing for nothing any longer.”</p>
                    <p>Our challenges are formidable. But there’s a new spirit of unity and resolve
                        in our country. We move into the 1980’s with confidence and hope and a
                        bright vision of the America we want: an America strong and free, an America
                        at peace, an America with equal rights for all citizens—and for women,
                        guaranteed in the United States Constitution—an America with jobs and good
                        health and good education for every citizen, an America with a clean and
                        bountiful life in our cities <pb n="700" facs="0741" xml:id="pg_700"/>and on
                        our farms, an America that helps to feed the world, an America secure in
                        filling its own energy needs, an America of justice, tolerance, and
                        compassion. For this vision to come true, we must sacrifice, but this
                        national commitment will be an exciting enterprise that will unify our
                        people.</p>
                    <p>Together as one people, let us work to build our strength at home, and
                        together as one indivisible union, let us seek peace and security throughout
                        the world.</p>
                    <p>Together let us make of this time of challenge and danger a decade of
                        national resolve and of brave achievement.</p>

                    <p>On January 28, 1980, President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs
                            <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Zbigniew Brzezinski</persName> took part in
                        a briefing for editorial page editors and writers on foreign policy issues.
                        The briefing took place from 3:33 to 4:09 p.m. in the Old Executive Office
                        Building. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> indicated in
                        his opening remarks that he would emphasize three points:</p>
                    <p>“The first is that the constructive agenda that the President set for himself
                        three years ago remains both still valid and binding in spite of the events
                        that have transpired in the last few weeks and which do call for sustained
                        response. When we assumed office we were deeply conscious of the fact that
                        America was somehow becoming increasingly irrelevant to a world of very
                        rapid change and there were many concerns that were apparently indifferent
                        to us and yet were motivating much of mankind, and there were problems of a
                        global type which needed urgent addressing: nonproliferation, development,
                        food, regional conflicts, human rights.</p>
                    <p>“I want to stress that even though we have been necessarily preoccupied in
                        recent weeks with matters of a more traditional type, a military challenge
                        with strategic consequences, these issues still remain of importance to us
                        and we will pursue them, for a very good reason. Unless we do so, we are
                        going to be living in a world which will be more and more hostile to our
                        values and more and more opposed to our interests. We owe it to ourselves,
                        we owe it to our children, to try to shape a more decent world. I know it
                        sounds maudlin and it sounds trite, but it is a central fact, that if this
                        country is to preserve its well-being and its way of life, we have to shape
                        a more decent world, a <pb n="701" facs="0742" xml:id="pg_701"/>more
                        cooperative world, and that in turn means addressing ourselves to the
                        genuine and real concerns of the world that is now politically awakened,
                        that is no longer controlled by a few empires based in Europe, that is
                        genuinely organized politically.</p>
                    <p>“This is why the constructive agenda to which we remain dedicated is still
                        binding and I stress that particularly because I know that I am seeing, as
                        the person who in this administration is more preoccupied with the other
                        things that I will be talking about in a second, and indeed I am and have
                        been, because my job is national security, and these other things are an
                        immediate danger to our national security. But I simply wish to put it to
                        you that our national security also depends on shaping a more decent world,
                        and this is something that concerns the President, that concerns me very
                        deeply, and I know the Secretary of State has been very actively and
                        successfully engaged in dealing with these problems, and I do not wish the
                        inference to be drawn that we are now fundamentally altering our foreign
                        policy. We are not.</p>
                    <p>“This being said, let me go on to the other two points. The first is that
                        détente is indivisible. We probably will be facing before too long a Soviet
                        peace offensive designed at dividing us from our allies, the West Europeans,
                        the Japanese, from us. It should not work. In my judgment it will not work.
                        There is no such thing as having détente with the Soviet Union in one part
                        of the world and open competition and the use of force in another part of
                        the world. This is something which I am sure our allies understand well, and
                        I think that the Soviets will find the West, by which I mean essentially the
                        industrial democracies, including Japan, to be united on this very
                        fundamental issue.</p>
                    <p>“This doesn’t mean that we want to drive the West Germans, for example, into
                        renewed Cold War intentions in an area of great sensitivity to them, such as
                        Berlin and the flow of human beings across the German frontier. We have
                        recognized the specificity of some of the countries concerned.</p>
                    <p>“But on the fundamental issues we feel and they feel that our common stakes
                        are engaged and that we will not let a Soviet propaganda campaign divide us.
                        But we ought to expect such a campaign. Indeed, it is beginning to
                        surface.</p>
                    <p>“The final point which I want to stress is that security is increasingly
                        indivisible. It may seem like an obvious point but it really isn’t yet, in
                        practice. The fact of the matter is that there are three central strategic
                        zones of importance to the United States: Western Europe, the Far East, and
                        the Mideast. In two of these zones we have a permanent military presence and
                        obligatory commitments. In the third one, the Mideast, we do not. We have
                        neither. Yet in recent years all three have become almost equally important
                        to us and of an interdependent im<pb n="702" facs="0743" xml:id="pg_702"
                        />portance to us in the sense that jeopardy to any one of the three
                        jeopardizes the other two and directly involves—and jeopardizes our own
                        interests. We could not afford to lose Western Europe. We could not afford
                        to lose the Far East and we cannot afford to lose the Mideast.</p>
                    <p>“So we have now a situation in which there are three central strategic zones,
                        each of which is important to us, and a jeopardy to any one of those three
                        means jeopardy to the other two and cumulatively to us. Yet we do not have
                        security arrangements which fully reflect that reality. We do not have that.
                        And we will not have them, in an identical sense, in all three regions. We
                        are not aiming at a repetition of the European experience, for example, in
                        the Mideast, a <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>-type alliance.</p>
                    <p>“But we are moving, clearly, towards an enhancement of our political and
                        military presence in that part of the world in order to increase its
                        security. That is an important strategic development and it reflects the
                        notion that security is increasingly indivisible, and this being the case,
                        there will be some pressures towards greater consultations within the
                        Alliance and with our allies on these matters, and thus over time a more
                        symbiotic relationship will develop in terms of political consultations,
                        perhaps even some military arrangements between all three zones.</p>
                    <p>“We are far from it yet. The Japanese, certainly, are not even militarily
                        engaged fully in their own defense so we can’t expect them to be engaged in
                        the defense of the Mideast. The Europeans have enough on their own hands to
                        assure the defense of Western Europe and we have some very active business
                        that we are conducting with them such as theater nuclear force deployments.
                        So they are not going to move into the Mideast to help us.</p>
                    <p>“Nonetheless, there is emerging now a greater sense of concern, a willingness
                        to consult on security matters, a greater willingness to consult on economic
                        aid to the Persian Gulf, West Asia and East region and thus in effect a new
                        important historical trend is being set into motion, translating on the
                        political/military plane to reality of the interdependence of the three
                        security zones.</p>
                    <p>“So those are the three propositions which I would like to put to you very
                        broadly and perhaps it may serve as a conceptual framework for the
                        discussion we can now have on current developments or policies.” (Carter

                    </list>
                    <p>The purpose of our Persian Gulf strategy is to protect our vital interests
                        there—interests shared with Europe and Japan. Because the projection of
                        Soviet power and influence into the region is the major threat to those
                        interests at the moment, countering those is the first priority strategic
                        task.</p>
                    <p>In effect, we have to complete the third phase of the great architectural
                        task undertaken by the United States after World War II. We constructed an
                        alliance in Western Europe; we undertook explicit defense commitments in the
                        Far East; we built <gloss target="#t_CENTO_1">CENTO</gloss>, a regional
                        security organization that never really flourished. Now we need to shape a
                        more flexible framework for regional security in the Middle East. That
                        regional security framework will have to avoid excessive formality, adapt to
                        the realities of intraregional conflicts, and facilitate varieties of
                        participation by concerned friends both in the region and in the other two
                        central strategic zones, Western Europe and the Far East.</p>
                    <p>The following outlines a number of steps we are either taking or need to
                        consider taking in order to fulfill your vision of the security requirements
                        and American interests in the region. The essence of our strategy is to
                        strengthen our presence and capability by</p>

                        and</p>
                    <p>—reducing the influence of the Soviet Union, its surrogates (Cuba, the <gloss

                    <p>You are well aware of our work on obtaining facilities in the region and
                        improving our rapid reaction force capabilities. We plan to strengthen
                        friendly governments and the security cooperation among them by engaging in
                        joint efforts to protect Pakistan, support the Afghan rebels, and reduce the
                        threat of the <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1">PDRY</gloss> against Oman, North
                        Yemen and Saudi Arabia. In the latter connection, we will also be
                        cooperating with our European allies, and possibly the Jordanians and <pb

                        contingency plans. Our long-term objective can be described as a Persian
                        Gulf/Indian Ocean region with a permanent U.S. naval presence and surge
                        capability, an Afghanistan whose neutrality has been restored, a
                        strengthened Pakistan, a more cohesive and cooperative Iran, and an Arabian
                        Peninsula free from threat from the <gloss target="#t_PDRY_1"

                        understanding that this study is expressly ordered by the President.</p>
                    <p>The underlying principles and premises of U.S. foreign policy should be
                        re-examined, clothed in concrete detail, and ranked by priorities.</p>
                    <p>There is considerable confusion today, among our Allies, probably in the
                        Soviet leadership, and certainly in U.S. opinion, about the basic philosophy
                        of your Administration in foreign policy. The confusion will be exploited
                        and compounded as the election campaign unfolds. But there is also genuine
                        and legitimate confusion. It is not simple to answer the simple question:
                        Has Carter’s foreign policy changed? What is left of detente? How Allied are
                        our Allies?</p>
                    <p>Along with these profound questions about the direction of policy, there are
                        almost equally important questions of the ways and means. How should our
                        impending military buildup be shaped to give maximum support to our
                        long-range strategic objectives in foreign policy? <pb n="708" facs="0749"

                        whatever kind of world we foresee?</p>
                    <p>I have been struck in my brief experience here with the difficulty that even
                        the most thoughtful people have in finding time to think about the year
                        after next. Iran and Afghanistan have of course imposed exceptionally heavy
                        day-to-day pressures. But even pre-Iran it was my impression that the top
                        people in foreign policy, including the President, had little chance to
                        stand off from immediate problems and think ahead.</p>
                    <p>I have also been struck by the high quality and quantity of the <hi
                            rend="italic">compartmented</hi> wisdom within the government foreign
                        policy community. I had an interesting conversation the other day with our
                        Ambassador-Designate to Turkey.<note n="3" xml:id="d141fn3">Reference is to
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJW_1">Spain</persName>, whom the President
                            appointed Ambassador to Turkey on February 19.</note> He has quite
                        concrete policy proposals and is prepared to guess/hope that within specific
                        periods of time these could lead to certain specific improvements in the
                        internal stability of Turkey and its dependability as an Ally. These
                        proposals would add up to his U.S. “program” for Turkey over the next
                        several years. Some of his ideas may be debatable; there may be <persName
                            corresp="#p_MJT_1">Jim McIntyre</persName> constraints he doesn’t
                        appreciate, etc., but I am confident that the intellectual resources exist
                        in Washington to establish a coherent set of U.S. objectives and
                        expectations for Turkey. And I’m sure the appropriate experts could build a
                        list of U.S. “programs” and scenarios, 1980–85, for the 30 or 40 most
                        important countries and all the major regions. These could be valuable
                        pieces of paper; still more valuable would be a systematic effort to look at
                        the separate programs and scenarios <hi rend="italic">in relation to each
                            other</hi>.</p>
                    <p>I have asked previously whether you were satisfied there is enough
                        “contingency” planning in our foreign policy. I ran up a list of a dozen or
                        so contingencies, some obvious, some perhaps outlandish. A much larger and
                        more knowledgeable list could of course be drawn up. This kind of thinking
                        should be a major element in the foreign policy study I am proposing. And
                        again, there should be a systematic effort to relate different places and
                        situations to each other. If Contingency A happens in Country B, does it
                        increase the likelihood of Contingency C in Country D, and what might be the
                        further consequences in Countries E and F?</p>
                    <p>To be factored into all these projections: Assumptions about energy, trade
                        and investment, aid, the dollar.</p>

                            >Carter</persName> administration’s foreign policy. <persName
                            corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> noted that for the past 4 months
                        concern had been focused on southwest Asia, Iran, the Persian Gulf, and
                        Afghanistan. Decisions made in any of those areas, he continued, had to be
                        placed within a broader, strategic outline. Responses needed to focus on
                        immediate concerns, while taking into account long-term strategic interests.
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> suggested that his
                        appearance before the Committee could serve the purpose of solidifying
                        “broad agreement on the general course that best suits America’s interests
                        and needs in the coming decade.” Recognizing that a full consensus proved
                        unlikely given the complexity of an independent world, he, nonetheless,
                        stated:</p>
                    <p>“But I do believe that despite differences on decisions that we have made and
                        that we and others will make during the 1980s, our nation can now shape a
                        new foreign policy consensus about our goals in the world and the essential
                        strands of our strategy to pursue them.</p>
                    <p>“This consensus can be built around agreement on two central points.</p>
                    <p>“—First, the United States must maintain a military balance of power. Our
                        defense forces must remain unsurpassed. Our strategic deterrent must be
                        unquestionable. Our conventional forces must be strong enough and flexible
                        enough to meet the full range of military threats we may face. As a global
                        power, we must maintain the global military balance. Our strength is
                        important to our own safety, to a strong foreign policy free from coercion,
                        to the confidence of allies and friends, and to the future of reciprocal
                        arms control and other negotiations. Our strength also buttresses regional
                        balances that could be upset by the direct or indirect use of Soviet
                        power.</p>
                    <p>“—The second central point is this: that our military strength, while an
                        essential condition for an effective foreign policy, is not in itself a
                        sufficient condition. We must nurture and draw upon our other strengths as
                        well—our alliances and other international ties, our economic resources, our
                        ability to deal with diversity, and our ideals. By drawing fully on these
                        strengths, we can help shape world events now in ways that reduce the
                        likelihood of using military force later. A global American foreign policy
                        can succeed only if it has both these dimensions.</p>
                    <p>“Some have argued that a strong response to Soviet military growth and
                        aggression is overreaction. But to disregard the growth of Soviet military
                        programs and budgets or to explain away aggression as a defensive maneuver
                        is to take refuge in illusion.</p>
                    <pb n="710" facs="0751" xml:id="pg_710"/>
                    <p>“It is just as illusory, and just as dangerous, to believe that there can be
                        a fortress America or that the world will follow our lead solely because of
                        our military strength. America’s future depends not only on our growing
                        military power; it also requires the continued pursuit of energy security
                        and arms control, of human rights and economic development abroad.</p>
                    <p>“As we look to the 1980s, our first obligation is to see the world clearly.
                        We confront a serious and sustained Soviet challenge, which is both military
                        and political. Their military buildup continues unabated. The Soviet Union
                        has shown a greater willingness to employ that power directly and through
                        others. In that sense, Afghanistan is a manifestation of a larger problem,
                        evident also in Ethiopia, South Yemen, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>“The world economic order is undergoing dramatic change. An energy crisis has
                        rocked its foundations. Economic interdependence has become a daily reality
                        for the citizens of every nation. At the same time, the assertion of
                        national independence has reshaped the political geography of the planet.
                        There is a profusion of different systems and allegiances and a diffusion of
                        political and military power. Within nations, we see an accelerating rise in
                        individual expectations.</p>
                    <p>“These challenges require a full American engagement in the world—a resolve
                        to defend our vital interests with force if necessary and to address
                        potential causes of conflict before they erupt. These hearings can help
                        illuminate how best to order and serve the wide range of interests we have
                        in a world grown increasingly complex.</p>
                    <p>“In my remarks today, I will discuss eight central American interests for the
                        coming years. Each is broad in its own terms. But I do not believe that any
                        of these interests can be narrowed, much less disregarded, without doing
                        damage to the others.</p>
                    <p>“—Our most basic interest, and first priority, is the physical security of
                        our nation—the safety of our people. This requires strong defense forces and
                        strong alliances.</p>
                    <p>“—It also requires that we and our allies firmly and carefully manage a
                        second area of concern: East-West relations.</p>
                    <p>“—A third area of interest—controlling the growth and spread of nuclear and
                        other weapons—enhances our collective security and international
                        stability.</p>
                    <p>“—Fourth, we must confront the global energy crisis and strengthen the
                        international economy; for doing so is central to our well-being as a people
                        and our strength as a nation.</p>
                    <p>“—A fifth interest, peace in troubled areas of the world, reduces potential
                        threats of wider war and removes opportunities for our rivals to extend
                        their influence.</p>
                    <pb n="711" facs="0752" xml:id="pg_711"/>
                    <p>“—Our diplomacy in troubled regions and our ability to pursue our global
                        economic goals are strengthened by pursuing a sixth interest: broadening our
                        ties to other nations—with China, for example, and throughout the Third
                        World.</p>
                    <p>“—The advancement of human rights is more than an ideal. It, too, is an
                        interest. Peaceful gains for freedom are also steps toward stability abroad
                        and greater security for America.</p>
                    <p>“—And finally, we cannot disregard our interest in addressing environmental
                        and other longer term global trends that can imperil our future.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> then discussed in greater
                        detail these eight elements of a broader American foreign policy before
                        offering his concluding remarks:</p>
                    <p>“I know that no one is more acutely aware of the breadth and complexity of
                        our challenges than the members of this committee. We face a broad agenda.
                        It requires constant, hard choices among compelling yet competing interests.
                        In a dangerous world, it requires a willingness to defend our vital
                        interests with force when necessary and a diplomacy of active and
                        constructive engagement to reduce the dangers we may confront. It requires
                        sacrifice in resources for our defense and help for other nations, in
                        reduced consumption of energy, and efforts to control inflation. It will
                        test our wisdom and our persistence.</p>
                    <p>“We will be badly served if we fail to understand a world of rapid change and
                        shy away from its complexity. The flat truth is that complex problems can
                        seldom be resolved by simple solutions.</p>
                    <p>“Some have said that we are trying to do too much. I say that we cannot
                        afford to do less, in our own national interest.</p>
                    <p>“Some say that in trying to do too much, we have accomplished too little. I
                        say that in strengthening our military posture, in reemphasizing and
                        strengthening <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, in negotiating the
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty, in normalizing
                        relations with China, in helping to achieve peace between Israel and Egypt
                        and a framework for a comprehensive peace in the Middle East, in advancing
                        peace in Zimbabwe, in the Panama Canal treaties, in the successful
                        multilateral trade negotiations and other improvements in the international
                        economic system, in closer ties to developing nations, and in promoting
                        human rights—in all these areas, I say we are on the right road, even if it
                        is a long and difficult one.</p>
                    <p>“Some say that in seeking peaceful change toward human justice in every area
                        of the world, we encourage radicalism. I say that the world is changing,
                        that human beings everywhere will demand a better life. The United States
                        must offer its own vision of a better future, or the future will belong to
                        others.</p>
                    <p>“Some have said that the executive and legislative branches cannot
                        collaborate effectively on foreign policy. I say that the record over the
                        past few years has been a good one.</p>
                    <pb n="712" facs="0753" xml:id="pg_712"/>
                    <p>“Some say that America is in a period of decline. I am convinced they are
                        wrong.</p>
                    <p>“There is no question that the years to come present a somber prospect.
                        Soviet challenge in Afghanistan and beyond, energy crisis, revolutionary
                        explosions when expectations run ahead of progress—such current events are
                        all too likely to be harbingers of the trends of the coming decade. This is
                        the reality we confront.</p>
                    <p>“But it is also a reality that our strengths—military, economic, and
                        political—give us an unmatched capacity for world leadership. We can succeed
                        if we combine power with determination, persistence, and patience. We can
                        make progress if we promote the full range of our interests and use the full
                        range of our strengths.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic"

                        <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> later wrote that his March 27
                        testimony served as his “final opportunity as secretary of state to define
                        and explain America’s foreign policy and its role in a changing world.” In
                        assessing his appearance, he noted:</p>
                    <p>“I had hoped the March 27 hearing would spark a serious discussion in
                        Congress, the press, and inside the administration about the way the United
                        States should conduct itself in a world in which the many complex problems
                        are not susceptible to solution by simple answers or the use of military
                        power alone. I was convinced that the main lines of our foreign policy
                        remained valid and would stand up well under a searching cross-examination.
                        But televised hearings do not encourage such debate. The senators were more
                        interested in the events of the moment, such as the grain embargo and
                        energy. Senator Si <persName corresp="#p_HSI_1">Hayakawa</persName> carried
                        this one step further by pressing me on the burning issue of collecting
                        traffic fines from Iranian students in Washington.” (<hi rend="italic">Hard

                    <p>As we meet today, the lesson of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan still
                        waits to be drawn. History holds its breath; for what is at stake is no less
                        than the future security of the civilized world. If one nation can be
                        subjugated by Soviet aggression, is any sovereign nation truly safe <pb

                        troops, and the barbaric use of lethal gas, and the specter of nightly
                        assassinations—if these fail to alarm us, what will? If the Soviet lunge
                        toward the most strategic oil-rich spot on Earth fails to unite us, what
                        will? And if we and our allies and friends fail to use every single peaceful
                        means available to preserve the peace, what hope is there that peace will
                        long be preserved?</p>
                    <p>While history holds its breath, America has moved decisively. To show the
                        Soviet Union that it cannot invade another nation and still conduct business
                        as usual with the United States, our country has embargoed 17 million tons
                        of grain, tightened controls on high technology trade, limited Soviet
                        fishing in our waters, raised our defense budget to upgrade all aspects of
                        our forces, strengthened our naval presence in the Indian Ocean, intensified
                        development of our rapid deployment forces, and offered to help other
                        sovereign states in the region to maintain their security.</p>
                    <p>In the U.N. General Assembly, the United States joined more than 100 other
                        nations in an unprecedented majority calling for the immediate,
                        unconditional, and total withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.<note

                        President, the Congress, and the American people understand that a world
                        which travels to the Moscow games devalues its condemnation and offers its
                        complicity to Soviet propaganda.</p>
                    <p>I am convinced that the American people do not want their athletes cast as
                        pawns in that tawdry propaganda charade. And I urge you to respect that
                        undeniable consensus. Your decision today is not a question of denying our
                        Olympic team the honor they deserve; for the American people, as you know,
                        deeply respect the sacrifice we are asking our athletes to make. It is no
                        longer a question of whether participation in the Moscow Olympics confers
                        legitimacy on Soviet aggression. When the Communist Party prints a million
                        handbooks to tell its top activists that the Summer Games mean world respect
                        for Soviet foreign policy, surely that issue is behind us.</p>
                    <p>Nor is it a question of drawing a line between sports and politics. That line
                        the Soviets long ago erased. When billions of rubles are diverted to the
                        games from Soviet domestic needs; when Moscow and other Olympic cities are
                        purged of dissidents who might speak out; when Soviet children who might
                        meet Western people and ideas on the streets are packed off to internal
                        exile; when Soviet emissaries roam the globe offering athletes expense-paid
                        trips to Moscow; when Soviet sports officials distort the number of teams
                        committed to participating—surely the issue of Soviet politics in Soviet
                        sports is also behind us.</p>
                    <p>Above all, the decision you will make today is not a choice between a sports
                        issue and a national security issue; for the President and Congress have
                        made it clear that the Olympic boycott is a genuine ele<pb n="715"

                        of Afghanistan. It is an unambiguous statement of our national resolve. It
                        is a keystone in our call to our allies for solidarity.</p>
                    <p>We must not—and cannot—break that link between America’s power to check
                        aggression and America’s call for an Olympic boycott. Your vote is a test of
                        our will, our confidence, our values, and our power to keep the peace
                        through peaceful means. It is not a partisan issue—for both political
                        parties resoundingly supported the President’s action in Congress. It is not
                        a parochial issue; for the American people overwhelmingly agree that we must
                        not go to Moscow.</p>
                    <p>And it is not just a national issue—for citizens and governments throughout
                        the world share our judgment. From his exile in Gorky, <persName
                            corresp="#p_SAD_1">Andrei Sakharov</persName>—the unsilenceable father
                        of human rights and the father of the Russian H-bomb—calls on America,
                        saying that “a united position on the Moscow Olympic Games must obviously be
                        a basic part” of the world’s response. This morning, as many as 50
                        nations—leading political and sports powers—await your signal to join
                        us.</p>
                    <p>Athletes and sports organizations and national bodies around the world await
                        your lead to mobilize their commitment. They do so for good reason. Today
                        virtually every industrial nation on Earth is dangerously dependent on
                        Persian Gulf oil. How could we convince the Soviets not to threaten the
                        gulf, if a blow was dealt to our deterrent? How could our government send a
                        message to Moscow, if tomorrow’s <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> brags that
                        our policies have been repudiated?</p>
                    <p>It is fitting that the same ancient nation that gave us the Olympics also
                        gave us democracy; for your decision here is truly a referendum on
                        freedom.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Berlin Olympic Games</p>
                    <p>And thus it is also a referendum on America’s character and fundamental
                        values. The athletes here, and the athletes you represent, may have been
                        born a full generation after the Berlin Olympics. But as their advisers and
                        trustees, you bear the responsibility of linking that history to their duty.
                        For the story of Hitler’s rise is more than an unspeakable tragedy, more
                        than a study in tyranny. It is also a chronicle of the free world’s
                        failure—of opportunities not seized, aggression not opposed, appeasement not
                        condemned.</p>
                    <p>By the fall of 1935, the Nazis had passed the notorious Nuremberg laws
                        reducing the Jews to nonpersons and were flexing their military muscle. For
                        a hopeful moment, American opinion was galvanized—and editorials and amateur
                        athletic unions across the country urged a boycott of the Berlin Olympics.
                        An American member of the International Olympic Committee, Ernest Jahncke,
                        made the plea most eloquently when he wrote the President of the IOC.</p>
                    <pb n="716" facs="0757" xml:id="pg_716"/>
                    <p>If our committee permits the games to be held in . . . Germany, . . . there
                        will be nothing left to distinguish [the Olympic idea] from the Nazi ideal.
                        . . . It will take . . . years to reestablish the prestige of the games and
                        the confidence of the peoples of the world. Sport will lose its beauty and
                        its nobility and become, as it has already become in Nazi Germany, an ugly,
                        ignoble affair.<note target="#d143fn4"/>
                    </p>
                    <p>The call for a boycott was rejected. And the reasons for rejection are bone
                        chilling—even across all these decades. Do not drag sports into the arena of
                        politics, they were told. It will destroy the Olympic movement, they were
                        told. It will only penalize our American athletes, they were told. Solutions
                        to political problems are not the responsibility of sporting bodies, they
                        were told. Let us take our Jews and blacks to Berlin and beat the Nazis,
                        they were told. If America refuses to go, we will be the only ones left out
                        in the cold, they were told.</p>
                    <p>Such reasons prevailed. Only weeks after American attendance was assured,
                        Nazi troops took the Rhineland; and Hitler readied Germany for the games.
                        His preparations cast uncanny foreshadows. For he expelled foreign
                        journalists, who told the truth about persecution. He ordered his vicious
                        propaganda concealed from foreign visitors. And he too looked forward to
                        legitimacy. As Joseph Goebbels boasted on the eve of the Olympics, the Reich
                        expected the games “to turn the trick and create a friendly world attitude
                        toward Nazi political, economic, and racial aims.”</p>
                    <p>It worked. Not even Jesse Owens’ magnificent personal triumph diminished
                        Hitler’s international propaganda success—a coup he linked directly to his
                        master race doctrine. We revere Jesse in death as in life; for he was an
                        exemplary American, an inspiration to millions everywhere, and a personal
                        friend loved by many of you here today. But neither Jesse’s achievements in
                        Berlin nor any words spoken at the games prevented the Reich from exploiting
                        the Olympics toward their own brutal ends. Listen to Nazi War Minister
                        Albert Speer’s report on the Fuhrer’s mood as the happy spectators left
                        Berlin: “Hitler was exulting over the harmonious atmosphere that prevailed.
                        . . . International animosity toward Nazi Germany was plainly a thing of the
                        past, he thought.” Before long, the Nazi war machine scarred the face of
                        Europe, and soon the night closed in.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Need for Sacrifice</p>
                    <p>We are far from that time—but not from that script. Like you, I understand
                        the ideals of sport—for sportsmanship is synonymous with <pb n="717"
                            facs="0758" xml:id="pg_717"/>fair play. Like you, I am in awe of the
                        Olympic tradition—stretching over centuries, reaching out across
                        cultures.</p>
                    <p>And like every American, I know the exhilaration of Olympic victory. Few
                        moments in my life match the electricity I felt at Lake Placid. And few
                        human experiences can compare to the years of sacrifice, pain, and yearning
                        that you and our athletes have invested in this summer. But I also know, as
                        you know, that some goals surpass even personal achievement. To any young
                        athletes who feel singled out for suffering, I say, it is war above all that
                        singles out our young for suffering. And it is war that our peaceful resolve
                        can prevent.</p>
                    <p>Everyone across the board is being asked to sacrifice. We need only ask the
                        farmers of the midlands if they have sacrificed. Or ask the workers in our
                        export industries if they have sacrificed. Or ask the computer companies
                        whose products have been embargoed. Or ask the businesses whose years of
                        planning have come undone. Or ask the young sailors in the Indian Ocean task
                        force. Or ask the American families whose taxes support our defense budget.
                        Or ask the Afghan athlete who faces the Soviets not on a field in Moscow but
                        as a resistance fighter in Kabul.</p>
                    <p>A heavy burden lies on your shoulders. We recognize the enormous price we are
                        asking our athletes to pay. We recognize the tremendous sacrifice we are
                        asking of sports officials. But on behalf of the President of the United
                        States, I assure you that our nation will do everything within its power to

                        by your courage. You will have restored to the modern Olympics the ancient
                        “truce of the gods.” No nation may serve as the Olympic host while invading
                        and subjugating another: That was the rule for the Greek city-states, and

                    <p>Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Cyrus Vance</persName>
                        submitted a resignation letter to President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Jimmy Carter</persName> on April 21, 1980, citing his inability to
                        support <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>’s decision to launch
                        a rescue operation to free the American hostages held in Iran. At an April
                        11 National Security Council meeting, participants supported the rescue
                        attempt; <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> did not attend the
                        meeting as he was away from Washington. In his resignation letter, <persName
                            corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> noted, “I know how deeply you have
                        pondered your decision on Iran. I wish I could support you in it. But for
                        the reasons we have discussed I cannot.</p>
                    <p>“You would not be well served in the coming weeks and months by a Secretary
                        of State who could not offer you the public backing you need on an issue and
                        decision of such extraordinary importance—no matter how firm I remain in my
                        support on other issues, as I do, or how loyal I am to you as our leader.
                        Such a situation would be untenable and our relationship, which I value so
                        highly, would constantly suffer.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic"

                    <p>“With great sorrow, I handed him the letter. He started to put it away. I
                        asked him to read it. He did, and then slowly put it in his pocket. He said
                        we would have to talk again. I told him that I wanted to make it clear that
                        I would resign whether or not the mission was successful. I agreed to his
                        request not to make my resignation public until after the rescue attempt,
                        and to remain in my position until the mission was completed. It was clearly
                        understood that my decision was irrevocable, whatever the outcome of the
                        rescue operation. Over the next three days I offered whatever advice and
                        help I could to make the operation a success.” (<hi rend="italic">Hard

                    <p>“I believe that all of you have received copies of my letter to the President
                        and the President’s letter to me.</p>
                    <p>“I have the greatest admiration for the President, and I am most grateful for
                        the opportunity which he has given me to serve him and our nation.</p>
                    <p>“As I leave office, I’m proud to have been able to participate in the
                        important foreign policy actions and new directions which have been taken
                        under President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>’s
                        leadership. They are important, not only for the present but for the future
                        of our nation as well.</p>
                    <p>“As you know, I could not support the difficult decision taken by the
                        President on the rescue operation in Iran. I, therefore, submitted my
                        resignation to the President last week. I have told the President that I
                        continue to support fully his policies on other foreign policy issues. I
                        have assured him that he can count on my support for his continued
                        leadership of our nation. He will always have my deepest respect and
                        affection.</p>
                    <p>“Thank you all whom I have gotten to know well over these last 3½ years. That
                        has also been a pleasure for me.</p>
                    <p>“Q. What is it about the rescue mission that you could not support?</p>

                        that, and that’s all I want to say. Thank you very much.</p>
                    <p>“Q. Is anybody else leaving with you?</p>
                    <p>“A. No. I hope that everyone in the Department will stay and support the
                        Acting Secretary and the President, and I’m going to tell him that.</p>

                    <p>“A. I haven’t made up my mind what I’m going to do. That might well be the

                    <p>On April 29, the President announced from the Briefing Room at the White
                        House that he had designated Senator <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Edmund S.

                            <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName>’s “extensive knowledge of
                        foreign affairs.” Following <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                        >Carter</persName>’s announcement, <persName corresp="#p_MES_1"
                            >Muskie</persName> offered a brief statement:</p>
                    <p>“The world is in turmoil. The issues are complex. But I believe that in this
                        instability the United States must be perceived as stable and as a source of
                        strength in the free world. As Secretary of State, I will devote my full
                        energies to achieve these goals. I respond to this challenge with genuine
                        hope. America remains a land of great opportunity.</p>
                    <p>“If these are dangerous times, they are also times of uncommon opportunity. I
                        harbor no doubt that the great majority of Americans share that view and
                        will sacrifice to that end, and I cannot stand in the wings when so much is
                        at risk and so many have raised questions about the country’s sense of
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>“And so let me end as I began: First to thank the people of Maine for their
                        unstinting support for many years and to recognize a great contribution
                        already made by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName> and
                        my thanks to the President for an awesome but a stimulating challenge as I
                        face the months ahead. Thank you, Mr. President.” (<hi rend="italic">Public

                            President: 5/80. In his diary entry for May 3, the President noted that
                            the participants had “discussed the relationship between State and the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>, Defense, the White House, and
                            Congress. I emphasized that I wanted to work with the deputy and
                            assistant secretaries in State so I could have some benefit from their
                            proposals, other than just to have a conglomerate watered-down,
                            lowest-common denominator recommendation—which has always been the case.
                            It became more obvious as we discussed the situation that Cy had been
                            bogged down in details and captured by the State Department bureaucracy.
                            Everyone felt good after the meeting, and it resolved a lot of problems
                            that could have been handled a long time ago had Cy been willing to let
                            anyone penetrate the State Department shell.” (<hi rend="italic">White

                    <p>1. Outline to him your fundamental approach to world affairs and the key
                        principles of your foreign policy.</p>

                        disputes and zigzags. The world must understand that there is constancy and

                    <p>3. Focus on those genuinely important issues that do require a policy review
                        and new decisions. Indicate the preparations needed and our approach to

                    <p>To facilitate the above, I would recommend that you proceed as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Fundamental Approach</hi>. The distinctive quality of
                        the Carter foreign policy is that it blends the two main strands of
                        traditional American thinking on foreign policy issues—strands that have
                        often been seen as in conflict.</p>
                    <p>You favor a more open, positive approach toward the Third World—but you also
                        believe it is essential to maintain a power equilibrium. The former is
                        designed to shape a more decent world in a revolutionary age—for otherwise
                        America would be isolated and increasingly vulnerable. The latter is
                        designed to prevent Soviet exploitation of that revolutionary process and to
                        create the preconditions for a more genuine and stable detente. (McGovern
                        and <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> have emphasized the
                        former and slighted the latter; <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1"
                            >Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName>
                        have stressed the latter and ignored the former.)</p>
                    <p>In addition, in the more immediate future, we must face the fact that the
                        Soviet invasion of Afghanistan poses a very major strategic threat, both in
                        the region and because it is clearly international aggression, and failure
                        to resist it undermines a central principle of world order since the Second
                        World War. It is not Afghanistan per se which is the issue but the
                        simultaneous disintegration of Iran as the American strategic pivot and the
                        disappearance of Afghanistan as a buffer that invites Soviet political
                        meddling and quite possibly even military intrusion into a region of vital
                        importance to us. This is why it is no exaggeration to say that we confront
                        the most serious long-term strategic challenge since the inception of the
                        Cold War. Failure to recognize its magnitude and to respond accordingly
                        would be an historic error, with probably irreversible consequences.</p>

                        This means no sudden warming of relations while the Soviets are busy
                        suppressing the Afghans and thus altering the strategic situation in the
                        third central strategic zone of vital importance to us.</p>

                    <p>Let me begin with a basic point: I believe now, as I believed a week ago,
                        that the Congress must be a full partner in designing our international
                        posture and must be fully informed on its implementation. The
                        Administration, the nation, and our foreign policies are the stronger when
                        the Congress is consulted before major policy decisions are made, and during
                        the course of major negotiations.</p>
                    <p>This is the first of what I expect to be many discussions with this
                        committee. I look to Capitol Hill—to my colleagues and friends here—for
                        guidance as well as support, for suggestions and healthy challenge. I also
                        want to take a moment to offer some general views—on our foreign policy, on
                        the role of the Secretary of State, on the connection between our
                        international posture and our condition at home.</p>
                    <p>We are a nation of great power. Our actions and decisions have global
                        effects. For our own people, for our friends around the world—and for those
                        who are not our friends—our fundamental course must always be clear.</p>
                    <p>I have brought no detailed new blueprint to this hearing. Only days ago I was
                        seated on your side of this room. In the days ahead I will be carefully
                        reviewing all significant elements of our international posture. Presumably
                        I will recommend to the President that we adjust some old policies and
                        assert some new initiatives. But I can certainly state this much now; I
                        would not be here if I did not support the central elements of the foreign
                        policy now in place—the policy that has been fashioned by President
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> and Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_VCR_1">Vance</persName>.</p>
                    <p>While there may be changes, there will also be continuity. Our nation’s
                        foreign policies will continue to serve our nation’s interests—the <pb
                            n="725" facs="0766" xml:id="pg_725"/>same interests that previous
                        Administrations and previous Secretaries of State have sought to defend and
                        advance.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Foreign Policy</p>
                    <p>Let me begin with my fundamental beliefs. I believe in strong American
                        defenses. We must maintain the military balance. We must continue to
                        modernize all elements of our defense forces. Dollars spent on defense, as
                        in any other area, must never be dollars wasted.</p>
                    <p>I believe in strong alliances—in our collective defense, in continuing to
                        strengthen our forces, in consulting regularly and with trust.</p>
                    <p>I believe in a firm and balanced policy toward the Soviet Union. The search
                        for common ground has been disrupted not by American preference but by
                        Soviet action. While aggression continues we must not relent in imposing a
                        heavy price. As Soviet policies allow, we must never be blind to
                        opportunities to work for peace.</p>
                    <p>I believe that balanced arms control agreements fortify our security. The
                            <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II agreement is no gift to our
                        rivals; it can serve our own interests by limiting the threats we face.</p>
                    <p>I believe in a positive diplomacy of active engagement. It is in our interest
                        to work for peace in troubled areas, especially the Middle East. It is to
                        our advantage to improve our relations with nations which have interests in
                        common with us—including many whose views and values differ from ours. We
                        must build our new relationship with the People’s Republic of China. We must
                        continue to broaden our ties to the nations of the Third World and of
                        Eastern Europe.</p>
                    <p>And I believe that America must stand for human progress. Our freedom and
                        rights are more secure when freedom and human dignity are advanced around
                        the world. Our own economy is strengthened by the economic progress of
                        others. We must lead international efforts to surmount an international
                        energy crisis and its consequences; to address the condition of hundreds of
                        millions of human beings living in degrading poverty; and to strengthen an
                        international trading system that is fair to our workers and our farmers,
                        our businessmen and our consumers.</p>
                    <p>These past months have been times of great trial. Terrorism in Iran,
                        aggression in Afghanistan, radical escalation in the price of
                        petroleum—these and other challenges will test us fully in months to
                        come.</p>
                    <p>But the past few years have been times also of accomplishment and strong
                        American leadership. Modernization of conventional and theater nuclear

                    <p>I am confident of that leadership or I would not be here before you.
                        Americans want their country to be a constructive international presence.
                        And we are. We have many strengths, not least of which is our system of
                        values, founded upon a belief in individual worth.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Role of the Secretary of State</p>
                    <p>Your inquiry today is directed not only to the substance of our foreign
                        policies but also to my concept of the role of the Secretary of State. The
                        Secretary of State must carry out a number of duties. And priorities must be
                        set among them. These are my priorities.</p>
                    <p>First, and most important, the Secretary of State is the principal adviser to
                        the President on foreign policy issues. He must have the primary
                        responsibility for recommending our foreign policy course, and seeing that
                        the President’s decisions are then implemented. President <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> has made it clear that he expects
                        me to play this role, and I intend to do so.</p>
                    <p>Second, the Secretary of State is the President’s principal spokesman for his
                        foreign policies. I intend to be very active in this role. I strongly
                        believe in the value of clear and direct public discussion of our foreign
                        policies. And I intend to consult very closely with the Congress on the
                        shape and direction of our foreign policies.</p>
                    <p>Third, the Secretary of State must make sure that the State Department and
                        the Foreign Service, as a whole, are fully engaged in the processes by which
                        policy is made and in discussions of foreign policy with the Congress and
                        our public. Neither the Secretary nor the Department can succeed if they do
                        not have confidence in each other, and work together.</p>
                    <p>I intend to make full use of the Department and our Ambassadors in a fourth
                        role: the conduct of our diplomacy abroad. There are times when only a
                        Secretary of State can manage a negotiation for our nation. But to the
                        extent possible, I will limit my own travel and rely on our skilled
                        diplomats.</p>
                    <p>A Secretary of State has other roles, as well: in administration of the State
                        Department, in helping manage and coordinate the overseas activities of U.S.
                        Government agencies, and in managing the flow of information from the State
                        Department to the White House and other agencies. Each must be carried out
                        efficiently. Each should require less of the Secretary’s time than the first
                        roles I discussed.</p>
                    <p>This is my concept of the job. The President has said that he supports me in
                        it. I will need your support, and counsel, as well.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Concluding Thoughts</p>
                    <p>Let me conclude with these thoughts. I come to this new assignment after 22
                        years as a member of the U.S. Senate. I have participated <pb n="727"
                            facs="0768" xml:id="pg_727"/>with many of you in the foreign policy
                        debates of the past decade—indeed, the past generation.</p>
                    <p>Through these trials our society has been moved to strengthen and vigorously
                        exercise our machinery for dissent and disagreement. That is all to the
                        good. We are better for it.</p>
                    <p>But our challenges call on us to focus as intently upon another part of our
                        national character—our ability to pull together and respond as Americans
                        when our interests are under attack.</p>
                    <p>I do not believe there can be unanimity on the great and complex questions
                        before us. But there can be a spirit of cooperation as we address them. I
                        appear before you today in that spirit.</p>

                    <p>[Omitted here are the President’s introductory remarks.]</p>
                    <p>For the past 6 months, all of our policies abroad have been conducted in the
                        glare of two crises: the holding of American hostages in Iran and the brutal
                        invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. In meeting these crises our
                        tactics must change with changing circumstances. But our goals will not
                        change and have not wavered.</p>
                    <p>We will not rest until our fellow Americans held captive in Iran—against
                        every tenet of law and decency—are safe and home free.</p>
                    <p>Along with other nations who have condemned Soviet aggression, we will
                        continue to impose economic and political costs on the Soviet Union until it
                        withdraws its armed forces and restores the independence of Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>These two crises underline the reality that our world is indeed a dangerous
                        place, but what I want to emphasize today is that amid the crises of the
                        moment, no matter how profoundly significant they are, <pb n="728"
                            facs="0769" xml:id="pg_728"/>the fundamentals of American foreign policy
                        are being carried forward with consistency, with strength, and with
                        determination.</p>
                    <p>The central reality that confronts America today is that of a complex world,
                        a world that is turbulent because it is politically awakened in its entire
                        breadth for the first time in its collective history.</p>
                    <p>Our world is one of conflicting hopes, ideologies, and powers. It’s a
                        revolutionary world which requires confident, stable, and powerful American
                        leadership—and that’s what it is getting and that’s what it will continue to
                        get—to shift the trend of history away from the specter of fragmentation and
                        toward the promise of genuinely global cooperation and peace. So, we must
                        strive in our foreign policy to blend commitment to high ideals with a sober
                        calculation of our own national interests.</p>
                    <p>Unchanging American ideals are relevant to this troubling area of foreign
                        policy and to this troubled era in which we live. Our society has always
                        stood for political freedom. We have always fought for social justice, and
                        we have always recognized the necessity for pluralism. Those values of ours
                        have a real meaning, not just in the past, 200 years ago or 20 years ago,
                        but now, in a world that is no longer dominated by colonial empires and that
                        demands a more equitable distribution of political and economic power.</p>
                    <p>But in this age of revolutionary change, the opportunities for violence and
                        for conflict have also grown. American power must be strong enough to deal
                        with that danger and to promote our ideals and to defend our national
                        interests. That’s why the foreign policy which we’ve shaped over the last 3
                        years must be based simultaneously on the primacy of certain basic moral
                        principles—principles founded on the enhancement of human rights—and on the
                        preservation of an American military strength that is second to none. This
                        fusion of principle and power is the only way to ensure global stability and
                        peace while we accommodate to the inevitable and necessary reality of global
                        change and progress.</p>
                    <p>The complexity of interrelated and sometimes disturbing events and
                        circumstances requires that we in America increase the degree of public
                        understanding of our foreign policy and public support for it. It is
                        extremely complicated. It is rapidly changing in its tactical confrontations
                        on a day-by-day basis, and the degree in a democracy with which Americans do
                        understand these complex issues is a prerequisite for success. Foreign
                        policy no longer has a single or a simple focus, such as defeating Nazi
                        aggression or repelling a monolithic Stalinist threat. Instead, Americans
                        must be mature enough to recognize that we need to be strong and we need to
                        be accommodating at the same time. We need to protect our own interests
                        vigorously while finding honorable ways <pb n="729" facs="0770"
                            xml:id="pg_729"/>to accommodate those new claimants to economic and
                        political power which they have not had in the past.</p>
                    <p>There are two obvious preconditions for an effective American foreign policy:
                        a strong national economy and a strong national defense. That’s why I placed
                        the highest priority on the development of a national energy policy, which
                        our country has never had. That’s why we must win the struggle against
                        inflation—and I’ve been very pleased lately at the trend in interest rates
                        and the good news we had this morning on the Producer Price Index.<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d147fn3">On May 9, the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued
                            its monthly Producers Price Index report, which indicated that prices
                            paid by retailers rose only five-tenths of one percent during April.
                            (Edward Cowan, “Producer Price Rise Cut to 0.5% in April; Cost of Food
                            Drops,” <hi rend="italic">The New York Times,</hi> May 10, 1980, pp. 1,
                            31)</note> The Congress and I are moving resolutely toward this goal; in
                        fact, every single American is involved. This common effort to deal with a
                        worldwide economic challenge does require some sacrifice, and I’m determined
                        that the sacrifice will be fairly shared.</p>
                    <p>The response of our democracy to economic challenges will determine whether
                        we will be able to manage the challenge of other global responsibilities in
                        the 1980’s and beyond. If we cannot meet these international economic
                        problems successfully, then our ability to meet military and political and
                        diplomatic challenges will be doubtful indeed. Although it will not be easy,
                        the innate advantages of our Nation’s natural bounty which God has given us
                        and the common commitment of a free people who comprise American society
                        give us the assurance of success.</p>
                    <p>We must also be militarily strong. The fact is that for 15 years the Soviet
                        Union has been expanding its military capabilities far out of proportion to
                        its needs for defense—a 4- or 5-percent real growth above the inflation rate
                        compounded annually for 15 years has caused us some concern. For much of
                        this same period, our spending for defense had been going down. If these
                        adverse trends had continued, we would have found ourselves facing a severe
                        military imbalance, an imbalance all the more threatening because of
                        mounting global turbulence. That’s why I have launched a broad modernization
                        of our strategic and conventional forces and worked to strengthen our
                        alliances. We and our allies have pledged ourselves to sustained, real
                        annual increases in our defense spending.</p>
                    <p>Our task is to build together a truly cooperative global community, to
                        compose a kind of global mosaic which embraces the wealth and diversity of
                        the Earth’s peoples, cultures, and religions. This will not be an easy task.
                        The philosophical basis of such a community must be re<pb n="730"
                            facs="0771" xml:id="pg_730"/>spect for human rights as well as respect
                        for the independence of nations.</p>
                    <p>In promoting that prospect for a future of peace, we will stay on the steady
                        course to which we’ve been committed now for the last 3½ years. We pursue
                        five major objectives; first, to enhance not only economic but also
                        political solidarity among the industrialized democracies; second, to
                        establish a genuinely cooperative relationship with the nations of the Third
                        World; third, to persevere in our efforts for peace in the Middle East and
                        in other troubled areas of the world; fourth, to defend our strategic
                        interests, especially those which are now threatened in Southwest Asia; and
                        fifth, to advance arms control, especially through agreed strategic arms
                        limitations with the Soviet Union, and to maintain along with this a firm
                        and a balanced relationship with the Soviets.</p>
                    <p>Our first objective, solidarity with our allies, is the touchstone of our
                        foreign policy. Without such solidarity, the world economy and international
                        politics may well degenerate into disorder. This is why we’ve led the North
                        Atlantic Alliance in its program to upgrade its conventional forces. And
                        last winter, in an historic decision, <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>
                        agreed to strengthen its nuclear missiles in Europe in order to respond to a

                        global economic cooperation but also to advance our political and our
                        strategic solidarity.</p>
                    <p>Second, we will persevere in our efforts to widen the scope of our
                        cooperation with the newly awakened nations of the Third World. By the end
                        of this century, 85 percent of the world’s population will be living in
                        Latin America, Asia, and Africa. In the last several years, through the
                        Panama Canal treaties, through our commitment to majority rule in Africa,
                        and through normalization of relationships with China, we have vastly
                        improved the relationship of the United States with these regions. We can be
                        proud of our accomplishments in building strong new bridges to the
                        developing world.</p>
                    <p>The United States respects the desire of the developing nations for genuine
                        nonalignment, and we respect the nonaligned movement as the expression of
                        that desire. Nations which value their own independence are already
                        resisting efforts to subvert the nonaligned movement and make it a tool of
                        Soviet foreign policy. Last year’s meeting in Ha<pb n="731" facs="0772"
                            xml:id="pg_731"/>vana was a notable example of Soviet failure, through
                        their puppet <persName corresp="#p_CRF_1">Castro</persName> regime, to
                        convince the other nonaligned countries to be subservient to the
                            Soviets.<note n="6" xml:id="d147fn6">The sixth conference of the Heads
                            of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Countries took place in Havana
                            September 3–9, 1979.</note> The United States is eager to work with
                        countries who pride themselves on their independence for the resolution of
                        conflicts and for the promotion of greater global social justice.</p>
                    <p>Third, we’ll continue to work for peace in the Middle East. Such peace is
                        essential to all parties concerned. Israel deserves peace, and Israel needs
                        peace for its long-term survival. The Arab nations require peace in order to
                        satisfy the legitimate rights of the Palestinians and to ensure that their
                        own social development can move forward without disruption and without
                        foreign intrusion. The West, including the United States, must have peace in
                        the Middle East or run grave risks that the radicalization of that area will
                        draw outsiders into its explosive conflicts.</p>
                    <p>The Camp David process has already led to the first peace treaty between
                        Israel and an Arab state. Of course, Egypt is the largest and the most
                        important and the strongest Arab state. We are determined to reach a
                        comprehensive settlement, and we will not be diverted from that goal.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_LSM_1">Sol Linowitz</persName>, our negotiator, is

                        full report from him on progress made and to determine the steps that our
                        country will take in the coming weeks to bring a successful conclusion to
                        this very difficult effort.</p>
                    <p>As we continue our efforts in the Middle East, I take pride as well in the
                        contributions that we have also made in other areas, such as the Panama
                        Canal Treaty already mentioned and the achievement of peace and majority
                        rule in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. These are major accomplishments, not only of
                        benefit to the people directly involved but to our national interest as
                        well. And it may very well be that in retrospect in years ahead, looking
                        back on this administration and this time, that those particular efforts,
                        making new friends among literally billions of people, as in China and
                        Africa, this will be recognized as the most important achievement of our
                        time.</p>
                    <p>And fourth, and very important: The West must defend its strategic interests
                        wherever they are threatened. Since 1945 the United States has been
                        committed to the defense of our hemisphere and of Western Europe, and then
                        later of the Far East, notably Japan and <pb n="732" facs="0773"
                            xml:id="pg_732"/>Korea. These commitments for a common defense are very
                        valuable to the people involved in those other areas, and of course they are
                        extremely valuable to us as well.</p>
                    <p>In recent years it’s become increasingly evident that the well-being of those
                        vital regions and our own country depend on the peace, stability, and
                        independence of the Middle East and the Persian Gulf area. Yet both the
                        Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the pervasive and progressive political
                        disintegration of Iran put the security of that region in grave
                        jeopardy.</p>
                    <p>I want to reemphasize what I said in my State of the Union Address on January
                        23d, and I quote:</p>
                    <p>“Let our position be absolutely clear: An attempt by any outside force to
                        gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on
                        the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault
                        will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force.”<note
                            n="8" xml:id="d147fn8">See <ref target="#d138">Document
                            138</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Peace is what we want. Peace is what we have maintained. Peace is a
                        prerequisite to progress. Peace is a policy of our country. The maintenance
                        of peace must be predicated on adequate American strength and a recognition
                        of that strength, not only by our own people and our allies but by our
                        potential adversaries as well.</p>
                    <p>We have been provoked in the last few months. Every action has been designed
                        to take advantage not of our military force, which is formidable and
                        unequaled, but on the benefits of the use of our alliances and on economic,
                        political, and diplomatic efforts. The steps that we are taking on our own,
                        and with the cooperation of others, involve complicated measures,
                        considerable expense, and a careful balance between the collective security
                        needs of the region involved and its political realities. These political
                        realities, again, are difficult to understand, extremely complex, and in
                        every instance rapidly changing. We are making good progress. We must, and
                        we will, make more progress.</p>
                    <p>The necessity of common action in the Southwest Asian region is dictated not
                        by any belligerence on the part of peace-loving nations, but by the clear
                        strategic threat that stems from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. A
                        failure to respond convincingly to that contemptuous act of aggression would
                        only invite its repetition.</p>
                    <p>Beyond the violence done to Afghanistan’s independence and its people, the
                        Red Army troops consolidating their hold there are also taking positions
                        from which Soviet imperialism could be extended more deeply and more
                        dangerously in the politics of this vital area. Afghanistan had long been a
                        buffer against outsiders seeking to dominate <pb n="733" facs="0774"
                            xml:id="pg_733"/>that region. Any quick examination of a map will
                        convince you of the truth of that statement. That is the historic role to
                        which Afghanistan must be restored.</p>
                    <p>Soviet success in their invasion of Afghanistan, even at the high cost in
                        blood and the high cost in respectability which Moscow is now paying, could
                        turn Afghanistan from a roadblock against aggression into a launching pad
                        for future incursions. This would threaten Pakistan and Iran, but not just
                        those nations alone. Soviet aggression in Afghanistan, unless checked,
                        confronts all the world with the most serious, long-term strategic challenge
                        since the cold war began. To underestimate the magnitude of that challenge
                        would constitute an historic error, an error with probably historic
                        consequences.</p>
                    <p>America’s position is clear. It is consistent, as well, with the interests
                        and with the commitment of our allies, whose well-being, along with our own,
                        is intimately tied to the security and the independence of this
                        strategically vital region. We must therefore work together in meeting the
                        challenge which we face in common.</p>
                    <p>Our goal is the withdrawal of Soviet occupying troops, the neutrality or
                        non-alignment of Afghanistan as a nation, and the encouragement of the
                        formation there of a government acceptable to the Afghan people. Those goals
                        and commitments are clear, they are simple, they’re extremely important, and
                        they are shared with almost every other people on Earth. Within this region
                        itself the nations must also realize that our desires match theirs—to
                        cooperate in the preservation of the region’s independence, stability, and
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>Fifth, this administration has been and remains committed to arms control,
                        especially to strategic arms limitations, and to maintain a firm and
                        balanced relationship with the Soviet Union. Our resolve to pursue this goal
                        remains as strong as ever.</p>
                    <p>Early this morning I had breakfast with the new Secretary of State, <persName

                        be discussing these issues, again, in a clear, consistent, forceful, proper,
                        balanced way. One statement that we will make very clearly is that arms
                        control and strategic arms limitation is of crucial importance to the United
                        States, to the people of the Soviet Union, and to all other people on
                        Earth.</p>
                    <pb n="734" facs="0775" xml:id="pg_734"/>
                    <p>The <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II agreement is a major
                        accomplishment of my administration. It contributes directly to the security
                        of the United States, and we intend to abide by the treaty’s terms as long
                        as the Soviet Union, as observed by us, complies with those terms as well.
                        Of course, we will seek its ratification at the earliest opportune time.</p>
                    <p>The time is also fast approaching when we must think beyond <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, to negotiating wider and more
                        comprehensive arrangements dealing both with additional categories of
                        strategic nuclear weapons and with weapons of less than intercontinental
                        capability. If the decade of the 1980’s is not to become the decade of
                        violence, we must make renewed efforts to stabilize the arms competition and
                        to widen the scope of arms control arrangements. After close consultation
                        with our allies and with the Soviet Union we intend to pursue these expanded
                        efforts to control weapons of all kinds.</p>
                    <p>Détente with the Soviets remains our goal, but détente must be built on a
                        firm foundation of deterrence. The Soviets must understand that they cannot
                        recklessly threaten world peace. They cannot commit aggression, and they, in
                        doing that, must realize that they cannot still enjoy the benefits of
                        cooperation with the West, and specifically with us. They must understand
                        that their invasion of Afghanistan has had a profound adverse effect on
                        American public attitudes toward the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>We represent a strong but peaceful nation, and there can be no business as
                        usual in the face of aggression. The Soviets will not succeed in their
                        constant efforts to divide the Alliance in Europe or to lull us into a false
                        belief that somehow Europe can be an island of détente while aggression is
                        carried out elsewhere. But let me be equally clear that the way to improved
                        relations is open if the Soviets alter their conduct. That is the path we
                        prefer.</p>
                    <p>Together these five objectives that I have outlined are the compass points
                        that guide America’s course in this world of change and challenge. They link
                        our specific actions to each other, to the past, and to the future.</p>
                    <p>Our foreign policy is designed to be responsive to the revolutionary age in
                        which we live. To be effective it must have the wise understanding and the
                        wide support of the American people. That depends on public realization that
                        foreign policy is not a matter of instant success. We must expect prolonged
                        management of seemingly intractable situations and often contradictory
                        realities. To play our historic role of protecting our interests and at the
                        same time preserving the peace, the United States must be steady and
                        constant. Our commitment to American ideals must be unchanging, and our
                        power must be adequate and credible.</p>
                    <pb n="735" facs="0776" xml:id="pg_735"/>
                    <p>While we seek to attain our broad ultimate objectives, we must never lose
                        sight of immediate human suffering. We’ve not forgotten and we will not
                        forget the 53 Americans imprisoned in Iran. Our Nation places a great value
                        on human life and on human freedom. We will continue to make every effort,
                        using peaceful means if possible, and through collective action with our
                        allies, to obtain the release of our countrymen. And we will remind the
                        Iranian leaders that the integrity and the independence of their own country
                        can only suffer from this policy of theirs that led to international
                        isolation and also internal disintegration. We have no permanent quarrel
                        with the Iranian people. We wish to fashion a relationship of dignity with
                        them, once this illegal action has been put behind us.</p>
                    <p>Our Nation has continued to act responsibly and in good faith toward both the
                        people and the leaders of Iran. Our rescue attempt was a mission of mercy,
                        not a military attack. No Iranian was killed or harmed in any way. Its only
                        aim was to rescue innocent victims of terrorist exploitation. I regret only
                        that it did not succeed and that eight gallant young men died in the
                        accident as the rescue team was leaving its desert rendezvous.</p>
                    <p>This morning I participated in a memorial service for those eight young
                            men.<note n="11" xml:id="d147fn11">The memorial service took place at
                            Arlington National Cemetery. For the President’s eulogy, see <hi

                        And before the service I met individually with every family involved. As I
                        approached them I had some trepidation, but in every instance they reached
                        their arms out for me, and we embraced each other, and I could tell that
                        their concern was about me, not about them. And they made comments to me,
                        “God bless you, Mr. President. We are praying for you, Mr. President. And we
                        are proud of our son or our husband, who was willing to give his life for
                        our country and for freedom.”</p>
                    <p>Our commitment to a world that represents human rights has been heard by all
                        people, by free people and also by those who do not know the meaning of
                        freedom. The eagerness of large numbers of Cubans, for instance, to flee
                        their own country is eloquent testimony to the failure of the totalitarian
                            <persName corresp="#p_CRF_1">Castro</persName> regime. We must ensure
                        that the Cubans who arrive in the United States and the Haitians who arrive
                        in the United States will be treated with all the humanity and the
                        compassion which we’ve extended to other groups and which we extend to each
                        other.</p>
                    <p>Every family, probably, in this room which came to our country came here as
                        immigrants, sometimes as refugees, and we should not be callous to those who
                        come in our present day and age under the same or even more difficult
                        circumstances. In order to bring an end to the suffering and the death on
                        the high seas and to permit us to best allo<pb n="736" facs="0777"

                        in these refugees must be orderly, and it must be in accordance with our
                        laws.</p>
                    <p>We’re working vigorously, yesterday and today, with 16 nations and with
                        international organizations, at a conference on refugees in Costa Rica, to
                        develop alternatives that will permit safe and orderly evacuation of the
                        Cubans who are seeking to leave.<note n="12" xml:id="d147fn12">Costa Rican
                            President Rodrigo Carazo Odio organized the conference. Attendees

                        will give highest priority to family reunification, and we prefer, of
                        course, prescreening in Cuba or in a third country, such as Costa Rica. Let
                        me emphasize again that we treat those seeking asylum and those who are
                        refugees from Cuba, from Haiti, and from other countries, equally, on a
                        case-by-case basis as is required by American law.</p>
                    <p>And finally I’d like to say to you that America’s foreign policy must always
                        reflect the kind of people we are. We are a strong people, we are a caring
                        people. We care about human rights, we care about decent living standards,
                        we care about the independence of nations, and we care about the rights of
                        individual human beings. We have a sober, responsible recognition that
                        American power is especially important in a turbulent world where others
                        depend upon us for their safety and for their freedom. Our interests and our
                        ideals serve each other. Our power must be used in the service of
                        both—interest <hi rend="italic">and</hi> ideals.</p>
                    <p>The course I have mapped to you today in this brief outline form is neither
                        simple nor easy, but it’s a sound course, it’s a safe course, which we must
                        pursue.</p>
                    <p>Our foreign policy deserves your understanding and your support, not only for
                        our Nation’s own security but in order that people everywhere can be certain
                        of America’s commitment to use its vast power with a clear, firm, steady
                        purpose—to seek for all humankind what we have: a future of progress, of
                        freedom, and of peace.</p>
                    <p>Thank you very much.</p>

                        the Allies in persuading them to respond vigorously to the Afghanistan
                        crisis was an indication that they disagreed with our strategic analysis of
                        the situation. He noted that our original rationale had been to try to
                        persuade the Soviets to withdraw and to deter repetition of the Soviet
                        invasion. The Secretary asked if the Europeans had in effect accepted a
                        permanent Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. <hi rend="italic">

                        </hi> stressed that it was important for the leaders of the West to talk
                        together in detail about the strategic challenge, either formally or
                        informally at dinner. Before going to the Summit, the President would have
                        to decide if he wished to pose sharply and directly the strategic issues we
                        confront, or to soft-pedal them. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                            >Brzezinski</persName> thought that the President should use the Venice
                        forum to portray the Soviet challenge as he saw it and to make clear that
                        palliatives such as a partial Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan would not
                        work. With this approach the President would stress that if we did not act
                        to meet the Soviet threat in Southwest Asia, a fundamental tipping of
                        history would occur. Giscard, <persName corresp="#p_SH_1">Schmidt</persName>
                        and <persName corresp="#p_OM_1">Ohira</persName> all had said that they more
                        or less concurred with our strategic assessment, but it was important to get
                        their collective agreement at Venice to our view of the implications of
                        Afghanistan. If we could do that, the individual measures we had proposed
                        would then be easier to achieve. Therefore, the President should make a
                        tough-minded, forceful statement at Venice. (S)</p>

                        </hi> observed that if we fell back from any of our efforts so far to apply
                        punitive measures against the Soviets, we would inevitably have reduced in
                        European eyes the urgency of our evaluation of the crisis and made it easier
                        for them to minimize their own:</p>

                        statement in Venice in a way to force the Allies to face up to the issue.
                        The President should ask whether the Allies agreed with our strategic
                        evaluation or not. <hi rend="italic">Dr. </hi> agreed and said that it was
                        important to set a higher standard for European action than we thought they
                        could probably meet. This would show U.S. leadership and also realistically
                        recognize that we had to ask for more in order to get the minimally
                        acceptable. (S)</p>
                    <p>In beginning to go through the individual measures we had pursued relating to

                        <persName corresp="#p_BRS_1">Bergland</persName> observed that this matter
                        would be decided by something over which we had no control—weather. If the
                        Soviet Union could harvest 225 metric tons of grain this year, it could
                        muddle through with minimal grain imports whatever we did. We would not know
                        until late June or July how the Soviet crop would turn out. <hi

                        that the key to holding at last year’s export level to the Soviet Union was
                        Canada. If Canada cooperated with us, Australia would follow. (S)</p>

                        intervention would be necessary. The Canadian bureaucracy was dead set
                        against our approach. In stressing that the Allies were generally against us
                        on this matter, <hi rend="italic">
                            <persName corresp="#p_OHD_1">Henry Owen</persName>
                        </hi> said that the chances of Canadian cooperation were less than 50–50.
                        Moreover, if the Soviets had an average crop year, our efforts to reduce
                        grain exports would not make much difference anyway. In any case, the
                        Canadians would make a decision on this issue in the next week or so and if
                        we intervened, it would have to be soon. <hi rend="italic">

                        </hi> agreed and stressed we had only two alternatives—to pressure the
                        Canadians or to abandon this effort altogether. He thought the Canadians
                        could be pressured but we must act now. <hi rend="italic">Secretary

                        </hi>, observing that this issue was a centerpiece of our post-Afghanistan
                        measures, said if we dropped it this would signal to the Europeans and the
                        Soviets that we were in effect dropping our anti-Afghanistan effort. We
                        would be saying that the problem was too tough. That would be perceived
                        abroad as a relaxation of our determination to respond to the Soviet
                        invasion. <hi rend="italic">Dr. </hi> agreed and said that we had no choice
                        except to go to the Canadians. It would be better to fail because Ottawa did
                        not agree than to drop the effort ourselves. The consensus at the table was
                        thus that talking points should be urgently drafted for the President to use
                        in a telephone con<pb n="740" facs="0781" xml:id="pg_740"/>versation with
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPE_1">Trudeau</persName> asking that the

                            (Carter Library, Presidential Materials, President’s Daily Diary) On

                            summary of the telephone conversation for the President. In the summary,
                            he indicated that the President had “asked that Canada hold its grain
                            shipments to the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> in 1980–81 to

                            and Australia would follow the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> and
                            Canadian lead. <persName corresp="#p_TPE_1">Trudeau</persName> said that
                            the Cabinet planned to discuss the issue on June 16 and that he could
                            probably give you a final answer at Venice, if not before. On a
                            temporary basis, he would maintain shipments at the 1979–80 level until
                            December, but he could not make any commitment beyond that.” (Carter

                        would resist. Again, all concurred that this should not be a matter for

                    <p>On the Olympics, it was agreed that we should send messages this week to

                        go to the Olympics and to try to persuade individual federations not to
                        attend the Moscow Games. Near the time of the Moscow Games, we should also
                        emphasize to those who would be attending that we hoped they would insist on
                        reduced ceremonies (no flags, anthems, etc.) at Moscow. <hi rend="italic"

                    <p>On the remaining issues before the group, it was agreed that we should make
                        clear to the Allies that, aside from political-level contacts, we intended

                        defense response to Afghanistan, especially the Belgians and Dutch who were

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Dr. </hi> then reminded the participants that the
                        President had endorsed the following division of labor concepts for
                        coordinating U.S. and Allied contributions to the security of the Persian
                        Gulf region:</p>
                    <p>1. Most important is that our Allies increase their commitments to <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s defense. This is the greatest
                        contribution they can make while the U.S. is building a security system for
                        the Persian Gulf region. (S)</p>
                    <p>2. Facilitating U.S. enroute access for military contingencies in the region
                        is the next most helpful thing the Allies can contribute. They should be
                        pressed to provide that access. (S)</p>
                    <p>3. On military exercises and deployments, we should encourage our Allies to
                        go through with those they have already planned but not to do more at this
                        time. (S)</p>
                    <p>4. We should encourage the British, French, and Australians to improve their
                        rapid deployment capabilities, but we should not encourage them to go beyond
                        their current plan. (S)</p>
                    <p>5. We should encourage the Allies to expand their security assistance to key
                        regional countries, particularly Turkey, but also Oman, Somalia, Djibouti,
                        and Sudan. We should encourage them to maintain at least the same level of
                        economic aid to Egypt, Turkey, and Pakistan and to expand economic aid with
                        the smaller countries in the region. (S)</p>

                            choice. Otherwise, we will all fail, &amp; the Soviets will win this
                            struggle—(they will still have a bear by the tail in Afghanistan).

                            meeting took place in the Oval Office at the White House. Drafted by
                                <persName corresp="#p_BM_2">Brement</persName>, who sent the
                            memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> under a
                            June 4 covering memorandum, requesting that <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                                >Brzezinski</persName> approve it. <persName corresp="#p_BM_2"
                                >Brement</persName> also noted that the memorandum “should make
                            interesting reading for future historians studying internecine rivalry
                            within the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> government in the late
                            1970s.” <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> placed a
                            checkmark on the covering memorandum, indicating that he approved it,
                            and added the following handwritten notation: “It makes for hilarious

                        </hi>. Everything was fine. Thank you very much. (U)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The President</hi>. I understand you appeared before the
                        Senate Foreign Relations Committee this morning. How did it go? (U)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName>
                        </hi>. I think it was a good session. There were no problems. (U)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The President</hi>. What message did you bring them?
                        (U)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName>
                        </hi>. I voiced complete support for all your policies and everything you
                        have been doing. I stressed the importance of evenhandedness and of getting
                        the country behind the President. I talked about the need for the draft, and
                        even for universal military training, if our adversaries as well as our
                        allies and others throughout the world are not going to regard us as paper
                        tigers. (C)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The President</hi>. That is a very good message. (U)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName>
                        </hi>. I very much appreciate the chance to talk with you and I know that
                        your time is very short. There are four points that I would like to make to
                        you and I have written them down. The first point at the top of my list is
                        real congratulations for the appointment of <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Ed
                            Muskie</persName>. I have a summer house in Maine, have had it since
                        1958, <pb n="743" facs="0784" xml:id="pg_743"/>and I know Senator <persName
                            corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName> very well. The appointment was
                        terrific, a real ten strike. Was this your own idea? (U)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The President</hi>. Sometimes other people around here
                        think of good ideas, but this was something I thought of myself. (U)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName>
                        </hi>. Well, you deserve real congratulations for it! My second point is the
                        need to find some way to go on with a strategic dialogue with the Soviets,
                        particularly if the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> process
                        flounders. Both my DCM<note n="2" xml:id="d149fn2">
                            <persName corresp="#p_GMJ_1">Garrison</persName>.</note> and I think it
                        would be a good idea to form high level groups of strategists from both
                        sides to continue the dialogue process. There has to be some way to follow
                        up and to talk together, especially if <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> won’t apply. (C)</p>
                    <p>(Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName> entered the Oval
                        Office.)</p>
                    <p>As far as the sanctions which we are undertaking against the Soviets, I am
                        completely with you all the way, even though many of them will lose their
                        effectiveness as time goes on. But we have no choice, it seems to me, except
                        to continue them, and not to make any basic changes in what we are doing.
                        (C)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The President</hi>. I think we ought to hold firm on that.
                        (C)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName>
                        </hi>. My third point (turning to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                            >Brzezinski</persName>) and here you might disagree with me, because I’m
                        going to mention China. The Soviets have a paranoid fear of China. They have
                        a long border with that country and they are irrational on the subject. They
                        do not talk about China. In fact, during my tour there no Soviet has even
                        mentioned the subject to me. So I think it important that we do not take
                        actions that will be misunderstood by them and that we maintain an
                        even-handed policy and not hurt them in this regard just to hurt them.
                        (C)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The President</hi>. All the actions we have taken toward
                        China are based on our desire to improve relations with that very important
                        country. We are not normalizing our relations with the Chinese just in order
                        to hurt the Soviets. (C)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName>
                        </hi>. I am no historian, and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1"
                            >Brzezinski</persName> certainly knows more about the subject than I do,
                        but it seems to me that the Chinese have a tendency to jump around from bed
                        to bed. And I think we ought to make sure that they are lashed down to our
                        bed before we undertake actions which we might regret later on. (C)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                        </hi>. You have to remember that we are very sexy people. (U)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName>
                        </hi>. The fourth point I would like to make, if I may, is to raise the
                        confusion and conflict between the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> and
                        the State Department. This is bad for our country and, when such confusion
                        exists, <pb n="744" facs="0785" xml:id="pg_744"/>it cannot help but affect
                        morale in our embassies, particularly when there is disagreement about basic
                        policies. (C)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The President</hi>. What kinds of policies? (C)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName>
                        </hi>. Well, China would be one thing—the policy of evenhandedness,
                        especially the question of <gloss target="#t_MFN_1">MFN</gloss> and of
                        supplying strategic products to the Chinese. We seem to be sending out mixed
                        signals. (C)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The President</hi>. This is a misconception. There have
                        been no high level differences on China policy. You can ask both <persName
                            corresp="#p_MES_1">Ed Muskie</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_VCR_1"
                            >Cy Vance</persName> and they will tell you that all our decisions about
                        China were reached with complete compatibility at the top level. There are,
                        of course, differences within the State Department, with each area and head
                        of area thinking his area should be preeminent and that his area is the most
                        important for our foreign policy. Dick Holbrooke’s attitude toward China is
                        different from that of the man in charge of European affairs.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d149fn3">Presumable reference to <persName corresp="#p_VGS_1"
                                >Vest</persName>.</note> I think that is the real origin of any
                        confusion regarding our policies. The State Department is an unwieldly,
                        compartmentalized bureaucracy. That is its nature and it is not going to
                        change. On <gloss target="#t_MFN_1">MFN</gloss>, we wanted to move together
                        with both the Soviets and the Chinese, but events made that impossible. I
                        can assure you that on the question of normalization with China and on the
                        sale of military related equipment to China there have been no major
                        differences at the top levels of this Administration. Isn’t that so, Zbig?
                        (C)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                        </hi>. There’s been only one difference that I am aware of. And that is that
                        Fritz pushed for <gloss target="#t_MFN_1">MFN</gloss> for China even before
                        we did. (C)</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WTJ_1">Watson</persName>
                        </hi>. Still, I think we should keep in mind the basic nature of the Chinese
                        and what they believe in. What are the real differences between the Chinese
                        takeover of Tibet and what has happened in Afghanistan? (C)</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Dr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>
                        </hi>. One main difference is that the Chinese invasion of Tibet took place
                        many years ago and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan took place last
                        December. We cannot as policy-makers deal with events which took place in
                        the distant past, or continually place in the forefront such occurrences as
                        the Soviet takeover of the Baltic States. In fact, the President’s policy on
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> was quite clearly articulated in
                        his speech in Philadelphia.<note n="4" xml:id="d149fn4">See <ref

                        Soviets did in Afghanistan. If you look back at the original telegram sent

                        time before your trip to clear it with others.<note n="2" xml:id="d150fn2"

                            Foreign Ministers.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>I have divided these issues into three categories:</p>
                    <p>(1) core issues which deserve your close personal attention;</p>
                    <p>(2) priority issues you could delegate but should monitor closely;</p>
                    <pb n="747" facs="0788" xml:id="pg_747"/>
                    <p>(3) secondary issues for which responsibility should be clearly fixed, and
                        which need only be monitored by you in a general way.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">I suggest that, however you decide to order these issues,
                            you use a listing such as this to make sure that responsibility for each
                            issue is clearly fixed among Chris, the Under Secretaries, and the
                            Assistant Secretaries.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>I hope this listing of issues also provides useful background in deciding on
                        specific accomplishments to pursue and in choosing speech topics.</p>
                    <p>Presidential campaigns are not periods conducive to grand accomplishments.
                        This period is no exception. The Soviets, the Europeans, Middle Eastern
                        leaders and others—as in similar periods before—will prefer to wait for our
                        election results before committing themselves to us on most issues.</p>
                    <p>But much can still be done:</p>
                    <p>—In a few areas, tangible accomplishments are possible.</p>
                    <p>—We can position ourselves—and, to some degree, events—for early
                        accomplishments in the second term.</p>
                    <p>—As an essential means to this positioning, you are in an extraordinarily
                        strong position to explain publicly our policies in important areas, clearly
                        and directly.</p>
                    <p>Unhappily, the specific accomplishments which might be possible—e.g., in
                        southern Africa, in Law of the Sea negotiations—do not generally lie in
                        areas of current, central concern: our relations with our allies, East-West
                        relations, our position in the Middle East and Southwest Asia, and the state
                        of the international economy.</p>
                    <p>Despite this fact, the major problems we face in these central areas require
                        your putting them at the core of your personal agenda.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">We must give our allies, our adversaries and our public a
                            clear sense of a strategy</hi> for dealing with expanded Soviet
                        capabilities and involvement; with the economic challenges afflicting the
                        industrial democracies; and with the Third World instabilities and tensions
                        that involve the interests of the superpowers and their allies.</p>
                    <p>By the end of the year, we can realistically seek to be in a position in
                        which:</p>
                    <p>—We and the allies are closer to agreement on the strategic implications of
                        Afghanistan. There will not be complete agreement and we will still need to
                        be pressing on them our view of the relationship between deterrence and
                        detente, but the current trans-Atlantic sniping can at least be muted. The
                        temptation to score points off each other in our and some of our allies’
                        electoral campaigns will continue to be strong; succumbing will continue to
                        be shortsighted and, in the long run, politically damaging.</p>
                    <pb n="748" facs="0789" xml:id="pg_748"/>
                    <p>—The Soviets (and our allies) understand that progress in East-West relations
                        is possible if Moscow shows restraint, and that we remain committed to arms
                        control.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">And, perhaps most important, we will be able to move
                            rapidly on the two key issues that can unlock other doors: <gloss

                    </p>
                    <p>One caveat before turning to a discussion of these core issues: while they
                        should be given priority attention in your public statements, we must avoid
                        giving the impression that these issues now represent the sum and substance
                        of all our foreign policies. To the degree that we have made our response to
                        Afghanistan synonymous with our foreign policy in recent months, we have
                        made the Russians seem stronger than they are; the U.S. weaker than we are;
                        our allies concerned that there has been a basic American shift back towards
                        a bipolar view of the world; and our foreign policy appear more reactive
                        than it is.</p>

                    <p rend="center">The Costs of Leadership</p>
                    <p>I welcome this opportunity to address the Foreign Policy Association and to
                        raise with you an issue of fundamental and long-term importance to our
                        nation. It is a matter that cuts across all aspects of our foreign policy.
                        It will decide whether the United States can have an effective, affirmative
                        foreign policy in the years ahead—or be left simply to wring our hands and
                        react to crises.</p>

                    <p>The issue is this: Are we willing to commit sufficient resources to the
                        defense of our interests and the promotion of our ideals abroad? The issue
                        was raised again by the decision last week on Capitol Hill to lop off still
                        more of the funds we budget to help other countries bolster their security,
                        develop their economies, and help their people to survive.<note n="2"

                            congressional inaction on the appropriations bill during a June 13 news
                            conference, noting that the lack of activity allowed the Soviet Union to
                            take advantage of “the doors of opportunity to spread their influence.”
                                (“<persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName>: Congress

                                Washington Post,</hi> June 14, 1980, p. A–11)</note> In less than 90
                        days, <gloss target="#t_FY_1">FY</gloss> 1980 will be over. We’ve gone all
                        this time with no aid appropriation for 1980. We’ve limped along at last
                        year’s spending levels. The practical effect has been deep cuts in critical
                        programs and projects. Now we have a supplemental appropriation. It
                        belatedly funds a few of the most urgent activities—but then excludes all
                        the others. This is not a solution. It has simply prolonged much of the
                        problem.</p>
                    <p>Consider just a few examples of what we are forced to neglect because of the
                        delay and the deletions I have mentioned.</p>
                    <p>• There is currently a serious shortage in Export-Import Bank lending
                        authority, a vehicle to promote American trade. That means fewer American
                        jobs and reduced American profits.</p>
                    <p>• Foreign military credit sales are curtailed—credits that could have been
                        used in areas of the world important to our security. Can anyone look at
                        Soviet activism in the world and conclude that this is the time to neglect
                        the security needs of our friends?</p>
                    <p>• The international military education and training program—a program that
                        increases the professionalism of military officers in developing
                        countries—has been cut by 25%.</p>
                    <p>• We are funding international narcotics control efforts at 20% below the
                        amount approved earlier by a conference of the House and Senate. This is not
                        a large program, but it serves our interests by attacking the drug problem
                        that costs the American people billions each year in crime, in lost health,
                        and in ravaged lives.</p>
                    <p>• We have to absorb serious cuts in the Agency for International
                        Development’s (<gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>) programs to promote
                        food production, rural development, and nutrition. Projects in the
                        Caribbean, in Kenya, and in North Yemen are among those in jeopardy.</p>
                    <p>• The multilateral programs are especially hard hit. Only 16% of what we owe
                        the World Bank has been approved. Funding for the African Development Fund
                        would drop 40% from the budgeted <pb n="750" facs="0791" xml:id="pg_750"
                        />amount—inviting interpretations that America’s concern for this important
                        African institution is waning and reversing the steady improvement in our
                        relations with Africa under President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName>. There is also a serious deficiency in funds for the
                        Asian Development Bank.</p>
                    <p>When we fall short in our contributions to these banks, development—and
                        people—suffer. Our influence in the banks suffers. Our ability to get others
                        to contribute suffers. Ultimately, our diplomacy suffers. Our contributions
                        to the banks are not simply invented by the Administration; they are
                        negotiated. The <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>
                        Administration has been scrupulous about consulting the Congress at every
                        stage of those negotiations. When the funds are then cut, developing
                        countries lose help they desperately need. And in the process, other
                        contributors—our allies and friends—lose confidence in America’s word.</p>
                    <p>I am not here simply to mourn the fate of a single aid bill, though in these
                        times that would be cause enough for concern. What concerns me even more is
                        a pattern. There is no lack of rhetoric calling for more American leadership
                        in the world—leadership we must continue to provide. But if we are to
                        continue to lead, then we must be prepared to pay the costs that leadership
                        requires.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Humanitarian Concerns</p>
                    <p>If this declining trend in foreign assistance persists, we will contribute to
                        a human tragedy of massive proportions. For we should always keep in mind
                        that these programs work to help people. Let me cite just a few
                        examples.</p>
                    <p>• Between 1966 and 1972, <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> helped design
                        250 clean water systems in rural villages in Thailand. The program was
                        successful and continued by the Thai Government. Now 800 villages are
                        served. As a result, water-borne disease—a major Third World killer—has
                        declined. At the same time, incomes have climbed and village life is more
                        stable.</p>
                    <p>• In another case, <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> started a credit
                        system in Colombia enabling small farmers to take advantage of land reform.
                        In a 15-year span, almost 35,000 small farms in Colombia have been financed.
                            <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> has sponsored similar programs
                        throughout the Third World.</p>
                    <p>• An <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> program in rural Guatemala has
                        stressed improved teacher training and better school equipment. Through this
                        program, the dropout rate in participating rural schools has been cut by
                        over 30%.</p>
                    <p>Viewed from a distance no single project is dramatic. But for the people
                        helped, even small projects are transforming lives. And the cumulative
                        global impact is profound.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Impact on U.S. Interests</p>
                    <p>Let me emphasize that these programs involve far more than our humanitarian
                        instincts. They bear strongly on our national interests. <pb n="751"
                            facs="0792" xml:id="pg_751"/>For the fact is that we have a deep and
                        growing stake in developing countries. We cannot get along without them—as
                        trading partners and markets; as sources of essential materials; as
                        necessary partners in efforts to address pollution and population, the
                        proliferation of nuclear weapons, and countless other issues touching all of
                        our lives. We want them to progress because we care about people. We also
                        want them to succeed because our own economic health is bound up with
                        theirs.</p>
                    <p>Our economic support funds—a central element in our security assistance—have
                        been essential to our efforts to help strengthen the economies of such
                        friends as Israel, Egypt, and Turkey. These funds also have provided major
                        support for our effort to help bring stability and peaceful change to
                        southern Africa.</p>
                    <p>There is nothing mysterious about the purpose of our international programs.
                        It is an approach that makes sense in the world just as it does in our
                        businesses, our families, or in any other aspect of our lives. Anticipating
                        a problem and dealing with it is invariably safer and cheaper than waiting
                        for crisis to erupt.</p>
                    <p>It is in our interest to do all we can now to counter the conditions that are
                        likely to drive people to desperation later. It costs less to invest now in
                        clean water systems than to work later at curing the diseases caused by foul
                        water. It is prudent to help people toward agricultural self-sufficiency,
                        instead of offering later the emergency programs needed to sustain life
                        against drought and famine. We would rather send technicians abroad to help
                        grow crops than send soldiers to fight the wars that can result when people
                        are hungry and susceptible to exploitation by others. So let there be no
                        mistake. By slashing these international programs we are not saving money.
                        We are merely postponing and dramatically raising the costs that one day
                        will come due.</p>
                    <p>These programs are important for another reason. With them, we have an
                        opportunity to influence events in crucial areas of the world. Without them,
                        our power to shape events is drastically diminished. All of us are
                        concerned—and rightly so—that we not slip into military weakness. We are
                        steadily modernizing our military posture. Yet cutting back our other
                        international programs contributes to another kind of weakness, every bit as
                        dangerous. It cuts back our arsenal of influence. Our support for liberty in
                        the world—our defense of American and Western interests—cannot be mounted
                        with military weapons alone. The battle for American influence in the world
                        requires more than rockets, certainly more than rhetoric. It requires the
                        resources that make our diplomacy effective.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Consequences</p>
                    <p>What are the likely consequences for America if we lack those resources? The
                        first consequence is American isolation. We need healthy <pb n="752"
                            facs="0793" xml:id="pg_752"/>trading partners. We need access to
                        facilities and resources. We need the support of others in helping to
                        achieve peaceful alternatives to regional conflicts. We need political
                        support—whether it be in resisting terrorism in Iran or aggression in
                        Afghanistan. But we cannot expect the cooperation and support of others on
                        issues of importance to us if we are unprepared to offer concrete support on
                        matters of importance to them—particularly their own economic development
                        and social progress.</p>
                    <p>Isolation would be only one consequence. Declining American aid, and
                        declining American influence, would also help the Soviets exploit internal
                        instability—in Nicaragua, in El Salvador, and in many other places where the
                        Soviets are prepared to exploit tensions to expand their power and to limit
                        Western influence. Nothing that I know of the American people suggests to me
                        that they want to give the Soviets this kind of free ride. I believe the
                        American people want their nation to resist Soviet expansionism—not only
                        militarily but by helping other nations defend their freedom and feed their
                        people. I believe the American people want their nation to be actively
                        involved in the world.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the decline of American aid and influence would hamper our efforts
                        to settle dangerous disputes and build peaceful, democratic solutions.</p>
                    <p>Let me give you an example. Over the past 3 years, many in the Congress
                        fought bitterly against President Carter’s Rhodesian policy. President
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>—courageously and almost
                        alone—insisted that the United States actively support Britain’s effort to
                        bring a democratically elected government to Rhodesia. Fortunately President
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> prevailed against bitter
                        opposition. In fact, his refusal to compromise prematurely on Rhodesia
                        helped bring to an end a bloody civil war in that country. The result has
                        been good for the people of Zimbabwe and bad for the Soviets, who sought to
                        exploit turmoil there.</p>
                    <p>Consider another case. We have been trying for a year and more to strengthen
                        the center in Nicaragua to help moderates there resist extremist solutions.
                        Every time we tried to appropriate the funds necessary to support our
                        efforts in Nicaragua, the effort was defeated. Finally, Congress has acted
                        to make possible $75 million needed to fulfill our commitment.<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d151fn3">The administration had proposed $75 million in aid for
                            Nicaragua in November 1979 as part of a broader assistance package to
                            Central America and the Caribbean. During a May 19, 1980, White House
                            briefing for members of Congress, the President noted that the Senate
                            had, that day, approved the supplementary development allocation for

                            942) The President signed into law the authorizing legislation for the
                            Special Central American Assistance Act (H.R. 6081; <gloss

                        delay, we suffered a loss of credibility. The <pb n="753" facs="0794"
                            xml:id="pg_753"/>willingness of the United States to work for democracy
                        was called into question throughout the region.</p>
                    <p>The point is this: Those most concerned about Soviet and Cuban activism in
                        the world should be the strongest supporters of our efforts to support the
                        moderate transition from repressive tyranny to democratic development. For
                        by failing to support the alternatives to radicalism, we help radicalism to
                        breed.</p>
                    <p>This continuing assault on foreign assistance is not only short sighted; it
                        is dangerous to American interests. For it threatens the capacity of the
                        United States to play a positive role in the world, to compete effectively
                        with the Soviets, to encourage emerging—and threatened—democracies. It
                        threatens to strip America of all its instruments except the instruments of
                        destruction.</p>
                    <p>I believe that the American people, if they have the facts, will understand
                        what is at stake. I believe they will understand that a generous investment
                        in security assistance and economic development abroad is necessary to a
                        strong America.</p>
                    <p>I am not new to this issue. Twenty-two years ago I made my support for
                        international assistance a centerpiece of my first Senate campaign.<note

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Foreign Policy and the Elections</p>
                    <p>Foreign policy should offer you the greatest opportunity for the exercise of
                        Presidential leadership, in a manner that could significantly influence the
                        outcome of the elections. Despite the constraints on Presidential power,
                        foreign affairs is the area in which you have the greatest discretion and,
                        thus—at least in theory—the most opportunity for demonstrating effective
                        leadership, for taking dramatic action, and for mobilizing national support.
                        Indeed, I have already heard from a number of well-informed sources that the
                        Republicans are very much concerned that you will stage some sort of a
                        foreign policy coup or undertake some bold initiative, or cut some
                        significant deal in the area of foreign affairs shortly before the
                        elections.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the present international situation simply does not lend
                        itself to some sudden and dramatic stroke—unless we are confronted by a
                        crisis. (In that event, a very strong and firm response, even involving
                        military action, is likely to be quite popular. Moreover, I have confidence
                        in our crisis-management machinery, and I believe that our performance would
                        be good.) But short of that, I cannot offer a prescription for a major
                        Presidential initiative of a type that would have significant electoral
                        effect. Something like <persName corresp="#p_EDD_1">Eisenhower</persName>’s
                        “I would go to Korea” does not seem to be available, and we must be careful
                        not to initiate some move in the Middle East or regarding the Soviets that
                        will appear contrived.</p>
                    <p>In any case, whatever happens, we need to do much better than we have done so
                        far in making the country understand both the constructive character of your
                        foreign policy and the dangers inherent in <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                            >Reagan</persName>’s approach.<note n="2" xml:id="d152fn2">The

                    <p>Accordingly, in this memorandum I plan to address myself as briefly and
                        concisely as I can to four broad themes that deal with foreign affairs:</p>
                    <p>I. The distinctive character of the Carter foreign policy;</p>
                    <p>II. Public criticism of <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s
                        approach;</p>
                    <p>III. Crises that we might confront;</p>
                    <p>IV. Initiatives that we might take.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                        <hi rend="roman">I.</hi> The distinctive character of the Carter foreign
                        policy:</p>
                    <p>I think the most distinctive hallmark of your foreign policy is that you have
                        blended together two elements that traditionally have been seen in America
                        as being in conflict: concern for moral principle and recognition of the
                        importance of American power.<note n="3" xml:id="d152fn3">The President
                            underlined “concern for moral principle” and “importance of American
                            power” and placed a bracket in the right-hand margin next to that
                            portion of the sentence.</note> In recent years, McGovern and later
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1">Kennedy</persName> have stood for the
                        former, while <persName corresp="#p_NRM_1">Nixon</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_KHA_1">Kissinger</persName> have stood for the latter.</p>
                    <p>In contrast, you have managed to combine the two in order to shape a foreign
                        policy that has been both moral and realistic. It can be best summarized by
                        the following themes:</p>
                    <p>(1) Restoring America’s military and economic strength for the
                            long-term.<note n="4" xml:id="d152fn4">The President underlined this
                            point.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>(2) Recognition of global complexity.<note n="5" xml:id="d152fn5">The
                            President underlined “of global complexity.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>(3) Progress toward a genuine partnership both with Western Europe and the
                        Far East.<note n="6" xml:id="d152fn6">The President underlined the portion
                            of this point beginning with “genuine.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>(4) On the basis of renewed strength, Allied cooperation, and diplomatic
                        firmness we can also seek accommodation with the Soviet Union.<note n="7"
                            xml:id="d152fn7">The President underlined the portion of this point
                            beginning with “accommodation.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>(5) Importance of the Third World.<note n="8" xml:id="d152fn8">The President
                            underlined “the Third World.”</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>(6) Human rights is a dominant idea of our times.<note n="9" xml:id="d152fn9"
                            >The President underlined “human rights.” He placed a bracket in the
                            right-hand margin next to this and the previous five points.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Finally, we neither run the world nor can run away from it.<note n="10"
                            xml:id="d152fn10">The President underlined the portion of the sentence
                            beginning with “we.” He extended the right-hand margin bracket to
                            include this sentence.</note> We cannot be guided by nostalgia for the
                        fifties (U.S. preponderance) or by <pb n="756" facs="0797" xml:id="pg_756"
                        />the partial isolationism of the early 1970s. The many tangible
                        accomplishments of your term (Panama, Camp David, China normalization, etc.)
                        are the consequence of this approach. They demonstrate how responsible use
                        of American power and influence can contribute to global peace and human
                        progress.</p>
                    <p>I believe the above summarizes the themes of your Administration’s foreign
                        policy, and that in time it will become clear that this was the proper
                        course for the nation at this time: a building presidency, not a flamboyant,
                        “fire-fighting” one. However, many of these themes—and even some specific
                        actions, like the Panama Canal treaties—are clearly not popular politically.
                        To be sure, there is merit in an “educational campaign”; but the direct
                        electoral benefits of discussing all the central themes of your foreign
                        policy are less obvious. “Complexity” and “change,” for example—however real
                        in today’s world—are a source of anxiety, not political approbation.</p>
                    <p>It is possible to group these themes in more politically attractive ways,
                        however, around two primary themes and two secondary ones:</p>
                    <p>Primary:</p>
                    <p>—American strength (defense, economic, energy, alliances); and</p>
                    <p>—peace.</p>
                    <p>Secondary:</p>
                    <p>—morality (human rights, Third World); and</p>
                    <p>—building for the future (alliances, economic summits, Third World).<note
                            n="11" xml:id="d152fn11">The President underlined portions of this theme
                            and the previous three themes.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>In my judgment, you are in fact on strong grounds on national strength—where
                        the Republicans are trying to make you look weak—and on peace. In the former
                        area, you have <hi rend="italic">reversed</hi> nearly a decade’s
                        (Republican) decline in our spending, are increasing the defense budget by
                        3–4% in real terms, buying the right modern weapons, and creating a capacity
                        to protect (through deterrence, not conflict) Western vital interests in the
                        Persian Gulf.<note n="12" xml:id="d152fn12">The President placed a dash in

                        energy program—for the first time beginning to reduce our national
                        vulnerability to decisions taken by other countries in this area. MTN
                        directly helps U.S. businessmen, farmers, workers and consumers. And the
                        economic summits (plus your building efforts in the U.S. economy) are also
                        contributing directly to U.S. strength in the world.</p>
                    <pb n="757" facs="0798" xml:id="pg_757"/>
                    <p>These are facts; but another fact is that we have not publicized our
                        successes as we need to do—and, for that and other reasons, thus do not get
                        the credit that you and your Administration justly deserve. We can be
                        assertive—not defensive—in this area.</p>

                        anxieties and difficulties of various crises (like Iran), no U.S. soldier

                    <p>The morality issue has primarily a selective audience—e.g. ethnic-Americans

                        Americans are also responsive to challenge, provided at the same time they

                        civil war, precipitating even a Soviet intervention. At the present moment,
                        we have relatively few means of influencing the outcome of such a civil war,
                        while we do know that the Soviets have started training for military

                        cause a patriotic upsurge. Thus, on the hostage issue we should at least
                        have the option to take prompt military action, either through a blockade or
                        (perhaps) the seizure of Kharg Island. I believe you should ask <persName

                    <p>The break-up of Iran would pose serious dilemmas, and our reaction would have
                        to be calibrated to any Soviet initiative. In any case, we would want to act
                        here in concert with some of the key regional countries, as well as our
                        Allies, although again the adoption of a very firm posture could have a very
                        positive effect.</p>

                    <p>Insofar as the Soviets are concerned, we should keep reiterating that
                        Afghanistan is the litmus test of Soviet intentions—though without putting
                        ourselves in the position of emphasizing Soviet failure to respond. If the
                        Soviet Union wishes accommodation, we are ready for the solution of the
                        Afghanistan problem, which combines transitional security arrangements with
                        a total Soviet withdrawal. In any case, we cannot afford any zig-zags in our
                        policy toward the Soviet Union, and a tough public posture by you and by
                            <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName> is essential, especially
                        if we are at the same time to be able to argue credibly that we are prepared
                        to seek arms control arrangements with the Soviets as a matter of mature
                        realism.</p>
                    <p>With respect to Cuba, it seems to me that renewed provocations by <persName

                        the forcible deportation to Cuba, through the use of the U.S. Navy, of some
                        Cuban criminals might be an appropriately dramatic step, designed to signal
                            <persName corresp="#p_CRF_1">Castro</persName> that there are limits
                        beyond which the U.S. cannot be pushed. In the Caribbean, we need to be able
                        to act promptly and credibly, without the appearance of indecisiveness with
                        which we are (unfairly) charged over Nicaragua.</p>

                    <p>There are some initiatives that you could take that might be helpful in
                        demonstrating effective Presidential leadership in the area of foreign
                        affairs. The following come to mind and you may wish to indicate here (by
                        marginal notes) as well as above, whether you want me to develop any of
                        these further:</p>
                    <p>(1) The hostage crisis: I think we should think about a more aggressive
                        strategy—though recognizing the political liabilities of an effort that does
                        not work. We might explore the possibility through our various
                        intermediaries of a meeting between <persName corresp="#p_MES_1"
                            >Muskie</persName> and some responsible Iranian official, <hi
                            rend="italic">if</hi> anyone emerges in the next three months. Indeed
                        such a meeting, if held in October, could have significant impact even if it
                        did not lead to the immediate release of the hostages—provided, of course,
                        that a legitimate and realistic process toward resolutions is the result.
                        There are undoubtedly some other ideas; but the problem is that without some
                        initiative we will surely be accused of permitting the crisis to have become
                        routine.</p>
                    <p>(2) We might explore secretly with the Soviets the possibility of some major
                        withdrawal of forces from Afghanistan just prior to the elections. Though
                        such an eventuality is not likely, it is conceivable that the Soviets might
                        reach the conclusion that <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                        will be too dangerous, especially given his repudiation of arms control. One
                        must be extremely careful how one undertakes any such probes because they
                        could contribute to the impression of zig-zagging. That is why they <pb
                            n="761" facs="0802" xml:id="pg_761"/>should not be undertaken formally
                        in the <persName corresp="#p_MES_1">Muskie</persName>-<persName
                            corresp="#p_GAA_1">Gromyko</persName> channel but more by indirection
                        and quiet hints (for example, in some of my informal talks with <persName
                            corresp="#p_DAF_1">Dobrynin</persName> and especially with the Poles,
                        who are anxious to promote a peaceful resolution of the Afghanistan
                        problem).</p>
                    <p>(3) Though the political benefit of U.S.-Soviet <gloss target="#t_TNF_1"
                            >TNF</gloss> talks would not be great, it probably would be useful to
                        have some exploratory discussions no later than October. That would
                        demonstrate that your personal interest in nuclear arms control can be
                        promoted alongside the policy of firmness on Afghanistan. Indeed, such
                        discussions would demonstrate that the kind of mature and two-track policy
                        that we wish to pursue with the Soviets is a more viable alternative to
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s extremism. We would

                        a real need for such a meeting, but it should not be convened unless we are
                        certain that it would prompt some tangible steps going beyond the Venice

                        seriousness of your commitment to enhance defense, without at the same time
                        requiring major budgetary reprogramming. In general, I believe that the best
                        posture in this area is assertiveness in expounding what we have done in the
                        past three and a half years. It is a creditable record—in defense, arms
                        control, peacemaking, peace itself, energy, human rights, and international
                        economics. As I indicated above, our biggest problem is not with the charges
                        the Republicans will level against us, but the need to get our story out
                        more forcefully and effectively.</p>
                    <p>For the past few years, there has been merit in a low-key approach in
                        presenting our case—and it has worked, in terms of taking the nation beyond
                        the phobias of Vietnam and Watergate, which so weakened our capacity to have
                        an effective or assertive foreign policy. In my judgment, we can now move
                        towards a greater highlighting of our purposes, achievements, and challenges
                        to the nation for further action—and gain a good public response. The themes
                        of strength and peace do not need to be elaborate; but only if we constantly
                        pound them home, <pb n="763" facs="0804" xml:id="pg_763"/>in a series of
                        statements, speeches, etc., are we finally going to get some of the credit
                        we deserve. This, after all, was the central tactic of your recent trip to
                            Europe,<note n="29" xml:id="d152fn29">After the Venice Economic Summit,

                        statement reinforced all the others—and eventually it got through to the
                        media, which saw this as a highly effective foreign policy effort. The
                        message also got through to our Allies, and their response also played well
                        here. This can, in my view, be repeated in the campaign here this

                    <p rend="center">Human Freedom: America’s Vision</p>
                    <p>We stand for human freedom. It is what unites us as a people. It is what
                        distinguishes us from our adversaries. It is our compass in the world to
                        defend our freedoms at home and to advance human freedom around the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>There are those who suggest that the freedom of other people is none of our
                        business, that with enough military hardware our freedom can be secure while
                        the freedom of others is stifled, that our purpose in the world is to
                        preserve the status quo.</p>
                    <p>I say, and I believe you say, that is an invitation to trouble. It is a
                        narrow vision of ourselves and of the world. It would be a foreign policy of
                        reaction.</p>
                    <p>We must, of course, equip ourselves with the arms to defend our vital
                        interests. But that’s not enough. We must also arm ourselves with the
                        conviction that our values have increasing power in today’s world.</p>
                    <pb n="764" facs="0805" xml:id="pg_764"/>
                    <p>For if America is not the companion of human progress in the world, if we do
                        not work to shape events in progressive directions, the world will pass us
                        by. If we do not promote freedom in the world, there will be less freedom in
                        the future for Americans.</p>
                    <p>Today, let me describe to you the kinds of freedom we must promote and the
                        tools we need to promote it.</p>
                    <p>First is the freedom of nations: the freedom of nations, including our own,
                        to be independent, to be free of outside domination. That has been and is
                        the enduring goal of U.S. foreign policy. But it cannot be our only goal,
                        for America’s national interest, America’s national ideals, require that we
                        support other kinds of freedom in the world.</p>
                    <p>This Administration is committed to a second kind of freedom: the political
                        freedom of people within nations.</p>
                    <p>And we are committed to a third goal: the freedom from poverty and human
                        misery, conditions that destroy human lives and create unrest in the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>A narrower approach, an approach which ignores the hopes and needs of people
                        within nations, cannot succeed. For it would ignore the political stirring
                        of humanity, the current of human freedom that is gaining strength in the
                        world. And when peaceful change is frustrated, violent and radical change
                        can explode in a storm that damages America’s interests and creates
                        opportunities for our adversaries.</p>
                    <p>So when Soviet troops seek to crush the freedom of an independent nation, we
                        will oppose it.</p>
                    <p>When an adversary threatens our vital interest in the Persian Gulf, in
                        Europe, in the Caribbean, in Asia or elsewhere, we will oppose them.</p>
                    <p>When foreign governments allow the seizure of American citizens, as in Iran,
                        we will not give up until they are home safe and free.</p>
                    <p>And when governments anywhere suppress the freedoms of their own people, when
                        malaria or malnutrition degrade human lives, we will oppose that as
                        well.</p>
                    <p>We believe, in short, that America can flourish best in a world in which
                        freedom is growing—freedom in all its aspects: national independence,
                        political liberty, and freedom from hunger, poverty, and disease.</p>
                    <p>To promote these freedoms, we need to maintain a foreign policy that rests on
                        four pillars.</p>
                    <p>• The first is an unwavering commitment to our security through a strong
                        defense, solid alliances, and unyielding opposition to aggression.</p>
                    <p>• The second is an unrelenting effort to help resolve the regional disputes
                        that threaten peace.</p>
                    <p>• The third is our foreign assistance programs which support the security and
                        progress of other nations around the world, while providing us with the
                        influence we need to advance our interests.</p>
                    <pb n="765" facs="0806" xml:id="pg_765"/>
                    <p>• The fourth is our support for human rights and human dignity.</p>
                    <p>In each of these four areas, this Administration has been active, and it has
                        achieved results. The world is an unruly place. The headlines will always
                        reflect new crises and new challenges. But I’m tired of hearing the fear
                        merchants who overstate the dangers and undersell America for their own
                        political profit. Let’s listen to the facts and not their fears.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Military Modernization</p>
                    <p>First, this Administration is devoted heart and soul and sinew to a strong
                        national defense. We have undertaken the most sweeping military
                        modernization program in nearly 20 years.</p>
                    <p>In the 8 years before President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> took office, real defense spending after inflation
                        had declined by more than 35%.</p>
                    <p>Since taking office, this Administration has increased real defense spending
                        every year by 10% overall.</p>
                    <p>We are modernizing every element of our strategic nuclear forces, with the
                        new MX missile on land, with a new Trident submarine and missile at sea, and
                        with new cruise missiles in the air. We are building a new rapid deployment
                        force and obtaining new basing rights abroad to strengthen our hand in
                        emergencies. We have led our <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies
                        in several major initiatives: a new long-term modernization of <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>’s conventional forces, real increases in
                        allied defense spending, and deployment of new missiles in the European
                        theater to meet the Soviet buildup.</p>
                    <p>Let us be clear. This military modernization program has, and will continue
                        to involve, heavy costs. Our 5-year defense program will put defense
                        spending in fiscal 1985 at a level more than 25% higher than in fiscal 1978.
                        This is a price we must pay to preserve our strength.</p>
                    <p>In recent weeks, you and I have heard this effort described as inadequate. We
                        have heard the call for a military buying binge. And we have heard demands
                        that we radically alter our fundamental national security objective from a
                        stable military balance to a quest for across-the-board military
                        superiority.</p>
                    <p>Let there be no mistake. That is a prescription for a dramatic new arms race.
                        For having achieved a position of equivalence, the Soviet Union will not
                        accept military inferiority anymore than we will—no matter what the price to
                        the people of the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The costs of a new arms race would be staggering. We would have to cut back
                        significantly on vital human services. And most importantly, we would
                        increase the risk of a nuclear nightmare.</p>
                    <p>The consequence of a new arms race would not be greater security. It would be
                        greater insecurity at home and abroad.</p>
                    <pb n="766" facs="0807" xml:id="pg_766"/>
                    <p>And there is a further point. In this effort to achieve military superiority,
                        we would destroy the future of arms control. For arms control can only move
                        forward on the basis of genuine equivalence. That is the basis of the
                        preliminary agreement reached with the Soviets by President <persName
                            corresp="#p_FGR_1">Ford</persName> in Vladivostok in 1974. It is the
                        basis of the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty. It is the
                        basis on which we have agreed with our allies to pursue further arms
                        control, including limits in Europe.</p>
                    <p>Let us have no illusions. If we abandon the quest for arms control now, if we
                        cast aside the treaty negotiated by three Presidents—two Republicans and one
                        Democrat—the threats we face will be greater. Our knowledge about Soviet
                        military plans will be less certain. Our own defense will be more
                        difficult.</p>
                    <p>Today America is strong, and we are growing stronger. We have already
                        reversed more than a decade of inattention to our national defense. We are
                        prepared as a nation to spend whatever is needed.</p>
                    <p>But we must be as hard on overspending on the military as we are on waste in
                        our domestic programs. And we should reject outmoded military doctrines that
                        add danger to an already dangerous world.</p>
                    <p>Our commitment to the freedom of nations also means that we must be prepared
                        to oppose aggression against the freedom of others.</p>
                    <p>Every day Afghan people are dying in defense of freedom. Every day the Soviet
                        Union is paying a price for their aggression. Every day the free nations of
                        the world must demonstrate their opposition to this assault on freedom.</p>
                    <p>Measures like our grain embargo and the Olympic boycott express not only our
                        disapproval; they express the readiness of the American people to sacrifice
                        in the cause of freedom. These sacrifices were necessary. And they have been
                        felt in the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>I am proud of our athletes who did not go to Moscow, and I know you are, too.
                        I am proud of our farmers and our businessmen and workers who have given up
                        exports to send the Soviets a message. And I know you are, too. For the
                        message has been received in an Olympics that was a sham, in declining meat
                        supplies on Soviet shelves, and in the stinging rebuke of world opinion.</p>
                    <p>The rhetoric of the past few weeks calls for us to be firmer on Soviet
                        aggression but to reverse the grain embargo, to write off the Olympic
                        boycott, to conduct business as usual.</p>
                    <p>There is a short answer. We cannot fight Soviet aggression more by doing
                        less.</p>
                    <p>We know, and the American people know, that we cannot oppose aggression
                        abroad without exerting ourselves at home. We know, and the American people
                        know, that security cannot be bought without sac<pb n="767" facs="0808"
                            xml:id="pg_767"/>rifice. To suggest otherwise in the hope of gaining
                        partisan advantage is not leadership but expediency.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Achieving Peace</p>
                    <p>A second element of a foreign policy of freedom is to build peace: to help
                        achieve peaceful, negotiated settlements to dangerous disputes in the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>You know of President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>’s
                        patient efforts to bring forth an agreement between Israel and Egypt at Camp
                        David. That agreement was a beginning, not an end. It was the beginning of a
                        long and difficult process that is not yet over. Camp David was one of the
                        finest achievements of this or any other Administration. It has already
                        produced peace between Israel and Egypt. And it provides the only practical
                        process yet devised that can lead to a comprehensive peace.</p>
                    <p>In a similar fashion, the Panama Canal Treaty, which ended 14 long years of
                        negotiations, healed festering resentments in Latin America and laid the
                        groundwork for sounder relations between the United States and our neighbors
                        in this hemisphere.</p>
                    <p>To build peace and buttress our strategic position, we have normalized
                        relations with the People’s Republic of China.</p>
                    <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>’s unswerving
                        support for a negotiated settlement in Rhodesia helped end a bitter and
                        bloody civil war. It helped bring forth a new nation, Zimbabwe, based on
                        majority rule and minority rights.<note n="2" xml:id="d153fn2">Zimbabwe
                            achieved independence in April.</note> It helped calm a dispute that
                        could have become a broader conflict in Africa. By working toward a
                        settlement, by refusing to lift sanctions against Rhodesia until a fair
                        settlement was insured, we emphasized not only our commitment to peace but
                        our willingness to support abroad the principles of democracy and freedom we
                        espouse at home.</p>
                    <p>Lloyd McBride<note n="3" xml:id="d153fn3">President of the United Steel
                            Workers of America.</note> and the steelworkers stood by the President
                        in that difficult moment. You supported continuing the sanctions until a
                        fair, free election could be held. You can be proud that this union has
                        contributed in an important way to a solution that fostered peace.</p>
                    <p>There is a lesson in this experience. The same people who call now for a
                        narrow vision of our foreign policies were bitterly opposed to our approach
                        in southern Africa. Had they prevailed, there would not have been a
                        settlement in Rhodesia. The fighting would have raged on. This would have
                        been bad for the people of Zimbabwe, bad for the region, bad for our allies,
                        bad for us, and good only for the Soviets who stood to profit from
                        conflict.</p>
                    <pb n="768" facs="0809" xml:id="pg_768"/>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Foreign Assistance</p>
                    <p>A third element of a foreign policy of freedom is helping developing nations
                        defend their independence, expand their economies, and dispel poverty.</p>
                    <p>For a good many years, this union and its members have understood an
                        important fact—that a generous foreign assistance program is not a giveaway
                        but a gateway: a gateway to new markets and new influence for the United
                        States and a gateway to greater world stability.</p>
                    <p>That fact needs to be better understood by the American people.</p>
                    <p>American foreign assistance dollars are investments we make in others and in
                        ourselves. These U.S. investments mean security aid to nations whose
                        independence is threatened by outside intervention. These investments mean
                        economic development for poorer nations. They help developing countries buy
                        American equipment to build highways and dams, help hire American experts to
                        strengthen their institutions, help them produce the food and the jobs that
                        increase living standards for their people. And these investments directly
                        benefit our own people.</p>
                    <p>Seventy cents of every dollar we commit for country-to-country development
                        programs are spent here in the United States. They purchase American goods
                        and American services, from farm equipment to technical training. Those
                        purchases amounted to nearly $2 billion last year alone. Our Agency for
                        International Development has spent over $650 million for goods and services
                        just in California over the past 10 years. Well over another billion dollars
                        last year went to American farmers for grain and other agricultural
                        commodities.</p>
                    <p>The economic return to the American people goes beyond what is spent here,
                        for our investments in development abroad create new markets for U.S. goods.
                        Every dollar we pay into institutions like the World Bank, for example,
                        generates between $2 and $3 of new growth in our own economy. The activities
                        of these development banks mean 50,000–100,000 new American jobs each
                        year.</p>
                    <p>In such transactions everyone gains. The United States gains jobs and markets
                        and the capacity to help shape events in constructive ways. Small,
                        struggling nations gain strength against aggression and subversion; they
                        gain economic and social progress. Millions of people gain the beginnings of
                        a better life. And the cause of freedom also gains.</p>
                    <p>So I would urge you to continue to defend these programs and help defeat
                        attacks and cuts recently suffered in the Congress.<note n="4"

                        requires not only a strong military fist but also an extended hand.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Human Rights</p>
                    <p>Finally, let me emphasize a fourth element of a foreign policy of freedom:
                        support for human rights.</p>
                    <p>Throughout a long history of struggle and success, the trade union movement
                        in general, and the steelworkers in particular, have supported that
                        cause.</p>
                    <p>Today, as hundreds of thousands of refugees flee from assaults on human
                        rights around the world, the steelworkers once again are showing their
                        concern. Your effort on behalf of the <gloss target="#t_AFLCIO_1"
                            >AFL–CIO</gloss> Cambodia Crisis Campaign, which Lloyd McBride unveiled
                        this week, is a dramatic testament to the power of this great union for
                        good. And it is an eloquent expression of your support for human rights.</p>
                    <p>Human rights has been a special concern of this Administration.</p>
                    <p>We stand for the right of people to be free of torture and repression, to
                        choose their leaders, to participate in the decisions that affect their
                        daily lives, to speak and write and travel freely.</p>
                    <p>There are limits on our capacity to influence affairs in other countries. And
                        we must seek a practical approach that builds the long-term strength of our
                        friends. But the fact that there are obstacles and risks should not keep us
                        from holding up the banner of human rights—and it will not.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, our firm support for human rights, for human freedom, will help
                        build a more stable world. It will help remove the causes of violent and
                        convulsive change.</p>
                    <p>There is, in various places in the world, a strong tide for human rights. We
                        see the evidence for this in Spain, in Greece, in Portugal, in Ghana, in
                        Nigeria, in Ecuador and in Peru, in other nations which have recently
                        embraced and strengthened democracy. America cannot claim sole credit for
                        these developments. But we can take pride that we have encouraged abroad the
                        freedoms we enjoy at home, for they run hand in hand.</p>
                    <p>I have sketched the outlines of the foreign policy of freedom: a strong
                        emphasis on security, a vigorous quest for peace, concrete development for
                        nations and peoples, and practical support for human rights. This has been
                        our policy for the past 4 years. And despite the difficulties, despite
                        limits to our influence, it is working.</p>
                    <p>We must not succumb to the voices which say we should now turn back. These
                        voices are pessimistic about the possibilities of freedom in the world. They
                        see change abroad, for the most part, as dangerous for America. They are
                        hostile to it. We see in change not only threats to be met but opportunities
                        to be seized.</p>
                    <pb n="770" facs="0811" xml:id="pg_770"/>
                    <p>Their voices sound a note of fear, rather than hope, when they speak about
                        the world. They have cried out against our efforts to strengthen the center
                        in Nicaragua and to pursue prudent arms limitation agreements.</p>
                    <p>Above all, these voices suggest that our defense of freedom should be
                        concentrated almost exclusively in arms.</p>
                    <p>We do need to revitalize our military. And we are. America can and will do
                        all that is necessary to maintain its military position, to counter
                        aggression, and to deter war.</p>
                    <p>America is and will remain a global power, second to none. But I believe the
                        American people understand that a foreign policy premised on a renewed arms
                        race is a foreign policy of folly, not wisdom; of weakness, not
                        strength.</p>
                    <p>I believe the American people will rightly refuse to write a blank check for
                        belligerence. America’s purpose is not a new cold war but a realistic peace
                        based on a solid foundation of deterrence.</p>
                    <p>We must seek security not only in arms but also in a diplomacy that is
                        generous, that is willing to cope with inevitable change, that is faithful
                        to decent human values. If we do that, we can be in the 1980s not only as
                        strong as steel but as resilient and enduring. We can be not only a fortress
                        of arms but a fortress of hope and freedom as well.</p>

                    <p>On August 21, 1980, President <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Jimmy
                            Carter</persName> delivered remarks at the annual convention of the
                        American Legion, taking place in Boston, Massachusetts at the John B. Hynes
                        Veterans Auditorium. The President began his remarks by outlining the
                        efforts of the Veterans Administration in providing support for veterans,
                        especially those who served during the Vietnam war. He then described the
                        four specific objectives of his administration’s national security policy:
                        preventing war, sharing in the protection of industrial democracies in
                        Europe and Asia, safeguarding and strengthening links to nations in the
                        Middle East, and defending America’s vital interests if threatened anywhere.
                        After a brief summary of the administration’s efforts to enhance U.S.
                        strategic forces and deterrent capabilities, the President explained the
                        relationship of this effort to projections of American force:</p>
                    <p>“Our strategy, now modernized to take advantage of Soviet planning and Soviet
                        attitudes, must leave them no room for the illusion that they can obtain any
                        advantage over the United States of America by the <pb n="771" facs="0812"
                            xml:id="pg_771"/>use of their force. And we will keep our forces that
                        strong and that clearly dominant.</p>
                    <p>“Recently there’s been a great deal of press and public attention paid to a
                        Presidential directive that I have issued, known as <gloss target="#t_PD_1"
                            >PD</gloss>–59. As a new President charged with great responsibilities
                        for the defense of this Nation, I decided that our Nation must have
                        flexibility in responding to a possible nuclear attack—in <hi rend="italic"
                            >responding</hi> to a possible nuclear attack. Beginning very early in
                        my term, working with the Secretaries of State and Defense and with my own
                        national security advisers, we have been evolving such an improved
                        capability. It’s been recently revealed to the public in outline form by
                        Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Harold Brown</persName>.
                        It’s a carefully considered, logical, and evolutionary improvement in our
                        Nation’s defense capability and will contribute to the prevention of a
                        nuclear conflict.</p>
                    <p>“No potential enemy of the United States should anticipate for one moment a
                        successful use of military power against our vital interest. This decision
                        will make that prohibition and that cautionary message even more clear. In
                        order to ensure that no adversary is even tempted, however, we must have a
                        range of responses to potential threats or crises and an integrated plan for
                        their use.</p>
                    <p>“Equally vital for our strategic purposes is the pursuit of nuclear arms
                        control and balanced reduction of nuclear arsenals in the world. Just as we
                        build strategic forces equal to our needs, we seek through negotiated
                        agreements to keep unnecessary competition from carrying us into a
                        purposeless and dangerous nuclear arms race to the detriment of our Nation’s
                        security and to the detriment of the adequate strength of our conventional
                        and other forces. We will continue to make every responsible effort to bring
                        our forces and those of any potential foe under strict, balanced, and
                        verifiable controls, both in the quantity of strategic arms and in their
                        quality.</p>
                    <p>“I want to make clear that if an unlimited nuclear arms race should be forced
                        upon us, we will compete and compete successfully. Let no one doubt that for
                        a moment. But to initiate such a dangerous and costly race, abandoning our
                        efforts for nuclear weapons control, would be totally irresponsible on our
                        part.</p>
                    <p>“The destructive power of the world’s nuclear arsenals is already adequate
                        for total devastation. It does no good to increase that destructive power in
                        search of a temporary edge or in pursuit of an illusion of absolute nuclear
                        superiority. To limit strategic nuclear weapons, as the <gloss
                            target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> treaties do, is not to reduce our
                        strength, but to reduce the danger that misunderstanding and miscalculation
                        could lead to a global catastrophe. This is a course that has been pursued
                        by the last six Presidents, both Democratic and Republican. To go beyond the
                        reductions that <pb n="772" facs="0813" xml:id="pg_772"/>were outlined in
                        the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II treaty, as I firmly intend to
                        do, is to advance the stability on which genuine peace can be built.”</p>
                    <p>The President then surveyed the steps his administration had taken to uphold
                        U.S. strategic interests in several geographic regions and to support
                        democratization, independence, and development in other nations. In his
                        concluding remarks, he returned to the theme of American strength:</p>
                    <p>“We do not maintain our power in order to seize power from others. Our goal
                        is to strengthen our own freedom and the freedom of others, to advance the
                        dignity of the individual and the right of all people to justice, to a good
                        life, and to a future secure from tyranny. In choosing our course in the
                        world, America’s strength must be used to serve America’s values.</p>
                    <p>“The choices ahead are every bit as demanding as the ones we’ve already made.
                        Facing them takes a clear understanding of where we are and where we want to
                        go as a nation. Responding to dangers that might menace our future security
                        also will measure America’s common sense and courage, just as previous
                        history has measured America’s common sense and courage.</p>
                    <p>“I’ve known America’s courage by seeing it tested. I’ve seen it in the men
                        who went to Iran to attempt so valiantly in an isolated desert to rescue
                        their fellow Americans who are still held hostage there. I saw it in the
                        families of the men who died in that effort, and I’ve seen it in the
                        families with whom I’ve met as frequently as possible of the citizens who
                        are still held captive in Iran. What a nation we are to produce such men and
                        women. All Americans are thankful to them.</p>
                    <p>“And finally let me say that our country also has the courage to reject the
                        easy illusions of something for nothing, the fantasy goals of strength
                        without sacrifice, the irresponsible advocacy of shortcut economics and
                        quick-fix defense policy. There are no magic answers. Easy solutions are
                        very difficult to find. Courage, sometimes quiet courage, unpublicized
                        courage, is the most to be appreciated.</p>
                    <p>“I see this kind of courage in you, as veterans who have served and
                        sacrificed already, but who still work continuously for the sake of service,
                        not for recognition or reward. Your example strengthens my faith in our
                        Nation and in the future of our Nation. With your help and with your courage
                        and with your common sense, I know America will continue to be a nation of
                        unmatched strength, a nation that faces the world as it is today and works
                        with realism to bring to the world of the future freedom, peace, and
                        justice.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers: <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"

                    <p rend="center">Securing the World’s Common Future</p>
                    <p>I welcome this opportunity to address the U.N. special session on economic
                        development. I intend to speak frankly. And I will suggest some specific
                        obligations of the world’s nations—including my own—to secure our common
                        future on a fragile planet.</p>
                    <p>We meet because we are in the midst of a world economic crisis. We cannot
                        escape it. We must respond to it. Millions of our fellow humans are
                        starving, and millions more are malnourished, on what can be a bountiful
                        planet. Soaring oil prices have crippled the developing world; even the
                        strongest industrial economies are struggling. Infectious recession and
                        inflation touch us all. Nations in desperate need of growth and development
                        instead face worsening trade deficits, deeper debt, and diminishing
                        prospects for meeting the needs of their people.</p>
                    <p>The work ahead is substantial. The time is short. But if we take an ambitious
                        view, seasoned with realism, we can accomplish our main purposes at this
                        special session. We can adopt a realistic international development strategy
                        that will help improve development prospects. And we can agree on procedures
                        and an agenda for a new round of global economic negotiations—serious work
                        aimed at concrete progress where the need is urgent and consensus appears
                        within reach. My country will participate constructively in these
                        proceedings. Progress is essential for the world’s interest and also our
                        own.</p>
                    <p>We are encouraged that progress is possible because progress has been made.
                        The fact is that over the past decade many people in developing nations have
                        attained better lives. Per capita income in the Third World has risen by
                        some 3% per year. Exports have increased by 8.7% annually. Manufacturing
                        output is higher. Life expectancies and literacy rates have improved. Infant
                        mortality rates have declined. Striking progress has been made, much of it
                        recently, in adjusting the system to improve Third World prospects.</p>
                    <p>• The flow of aid to poorer nations has steadily increased. More than $100
                        billion in replenishments for the multilateral development banks and their
                        affiliates have been agreed.</p>
                    <pb n="774" facs="0815" xml:id="pg_774"/>
                    <p>• Access to International Monetary Fund resources has been sharply increased.
                        Terms are more flexible. New facilities are in operation. A major quota
                        increase is in process. The World Bank has also launched an innovative
                        program of lending for structural adjustment.</p>
                    <p>• The common fund negotiations have been completed. We have moved ahead on
                        individual commodity agreements.</p>
                    <p>• On trade, last year’s multilateral trade agreement will mean an average cut
                        of 25% in tariffs on principal developing-country exports. Preferential
                        tariff systems have been adopted by all Western industrial countries.</p>
                    <p>• Use by developing countries of world capital markets has increased
                        fourfold—from $11 billion in 1970 to $44 billion in 1978.</p>
                    <p>• The effort to increase world food supplies has been advanced through the
                        International Fund for Agricultural Development and through the
                        concentration of World Bank resources. In the past 5 years the World Bank
                        committed some $11.6 billion to agricultural projects.</p>
                    <p>• And in another urgent priority area—energy—the World Bank will be lending
                        well over $10 billion for energy projects between now and 1985.</p>
                    <p>This partial listing is not the record of a world community frozen in
                        shortsighted self-interest, rigidly divided by ideology or stalemated on
                        methods. Those tendencies do afflict us. Yet in recent years we have also
                        found the common sense and good will to move forward.</p>
                    <p>But our accomplishments are still far short of our needs. My government has
                        just completed a major study of the world’s population, resources, and
                        environmental prospects for the year 2000—just 20 years away.<note n="2"

                        remind us again why these debates must move from rhetoric to reality. Our

                        population will be more than half again higher than in 1975. Over the last
                        quarter of this century, more than 2 billion people will be added—2 billion
                        more mouths to feed, bodies to clothe, individual hopes to be fulfilled.</p>
                    <p>Given this fact, the study tells us what could happen if nations fail to act
                        in time and with reason. Based on current trends, food production should
                        nearly double. Still, the number of people going hungry will rise by
                        millions. Many nations already hungry see their croplands <pb n="775"
                            facs="0816" xml:id="pg_775"/>and grasslands drying to desert—a loss each
                        year equal to the size of my home State of Maine.</p>
                    <p>On energy, from the vantage of a precarious present, we could face a
                        punishing future. Unless trends are changed, oil supplies will be
                        insufficient and, for many, unaffordable. Wood, the main household fuel for
                        over 1 billion people, will be found only at ever greater distances and in
                        dwindling amounts.</p>
                    <p>We have become accustomed to warnings about the need to conserve nonrenewable
                        resources such as oil. But the “Global 2000” study also points up serious
                        stresses on renewable resources—croplands and forests, fisheries, air,
                        water, and land—resources we have taken for granted as endless.</p>
                    <p>Another central observation of the study is that protecting the environment
                        and succeeding in economic development are not competing goals but
                        complementary paths. Poverty worsens the most acute environmental dangers,
                        such as the loss of forests and soil. Thus we will not save the environment
                        unless we also solve the problems of the poor and move the global economy
                        forward.</p>
                    <p>“Global 2000” is not a forecast. It is a projection of present trends. But it
                        is another chilling reminder that our common future depends on our common
                        success, here and throughout the complex of relations known as the
                        North-South dialogue. We must work together to raise food production, to
                        diversify energy sources and to use energy and other resources more
                        efficiently, to protect our common environment, to restrain population
                        growth, to deal effectively and equitably with mounting deficits, and to
                        keep an open system of trade.</p>
                    <p>It falls to us to rewrite the future. It is within our power to do so. But it
                        will require a change not only in the quantity but in the character of our
                        effort. For as fast as we have run in recent years, the challenges still
                        outpace us. Too often, as the Brandt Commission reminds us, we have engaged
                        in a “dialogue of the deaf,” in which “we judge ourselves by our good points
                        and the other side by their failings.<note n="3" xml:id="d155fn3">Reference

                    <p>That deadlock must be broken. The demands of our common future require it.
                        They compel a new inquiry. We must ask not only what individual nations can
                        take from the global system but what each nation must bring to it. Without
                        exception, we must recognize that assigning responsibility for the future to
                        others is not an answer but an <pb n="776" facs="0817" xml:id="pg_776"
                        />abdication. Such excuses will not feed, nor clothe, nor heal, nor comfort
                        our successors if we fail. And fail we will, unless all nations are fully
                        engaged.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Industrial Countries.</hi> I do not by any means exclude
                        my own country from this prescription. In suggesting what different
                        societies, differently situated, should offer, let me begin with the
                        industrial countries.</p>
                    <p>• First, we must reduce the rate of our domestic inflation. Spiraling prices
                        restrain growth and make the world economy more vulnerable and less
                        fair.</p>
                    <p>• Second, we should keep our markets open, particularly to products from
                        developing countries.</p>
                    <p>• Third, the industrial nations must use energy more efficiently, increase
                        domestic production, spur the development of new energy sources, and cut our
                        reliance on imported oil.</p>
                    <p>• Fourth, despite the need for budget restraint to control inflation, we
                        should increase our aid to the developing nations. This Administration has
                        said many times to the American Congress and the American people that our
                        present levels of assistance to lower income countries are not enough. I
                        intend to keep doing all in my power to change that condition.</p>
                    <p>• Fifth, developed countries should continue to accept an increasing role for
                        developing countries in international economic decisionmaking—a role
                        commensurate with their growing importance in the world economy and their
                        willingness to share international obligations.</p>
                    <p>• Sixth, we must increase the capacity of developing countries to apply
                        science and technology for development. We must accelerate the transfer of
                        information, technology, pollution-control strategies, and other skills.</p>
                    <p>Most of these steps will entail short-term sacrifice for the sake of
                        long-term returns. I believe the American people will support those
                        investments. But as a former practicing politician, let me speak frankly.
                        The American people will insist that their contributions have an effect—that
                        people’s lives must actually be changed for the better. And we can assure
                        that only if other nations are also prepared to do their part.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Oil-Exporting Nations.</hi> The oil-exporting nations have
                        a unique responsibility. In recent years rising oil prices have been a
                        ponderous drag on development and growth and a major cause of inflation.
                        This year the oil-importing developing countries will have to spend—for that
                        single commodity—almost double the amount they will receive <pb n="777"
                            facs="0818" xml:id="pg_777"/>from all sources in aid. Thus steps such as
                        these by oil-exporting nations will be vital to our common goals:</p>
                    <p>• First, they must adopt stable price and supply policies to avoid further
                        trauma to the international economy.</p>
                    <p>• Second, the oil-exporting countries must increase their aid and recycle
                        more of their surpluses directly to developing countries.</p>
                    <p>• Third, oil-exporting countries should join with consuming nations in
                        working for rational global energy arrangements.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Developing Countries.</hi> Whatever the level, external
                        assistance will always be a secondary factor. The major determinants are
                        internal—the ability to use resources effectively, to encourage innovation,
                        and to share broadly the benefits of growth. Thus, there are
                        responsibilities that developing countries must shoulder.</p>
                    <p>• First, domestic and external resources must be used efficiently and fairly,
                        with concentration on such priority areas as energy and food.</p>
                    <p>• Second, serious family-planning efforts are vital. Nine-tenths of the
                        world’s population increase in the next 20 years will be in developing
                        countries. No other single factor does more to darken their future.</p>
                    <p>• Third, as their economic strength grows, individual developing nations
                        should accept more responsibility for the common management of international
                        economic problems.</p>
                    <p>• Fourth, as their development proceeds, they must open their own economies
                        to free flows of world trade.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Centrally Planned Countries.</hi> The market economy
                        countries have received dominant attention in the North-South dialogue. But
                        the centrally planned countries have global responsibilities as well. Empty
                        bellies will not be filled by polemics. No nation or group of nations has
                        grounds to remain aloof from this struggle. World opinion looks to the
                        centrally planned countries:</p>
                    <p>• First, to increase their assistance to developing countries;</p>
                    <p>• Second, to increase their unconditioned purchases of <gloss

                    <p>• Third, to cooperate in international efforts to stabilize commodity
                        markets.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Proposals</p>
                    <p>For all of us, the principles I have outlined must be the basis for practical
                        action. For our part the United States is prepared to join with others to
                        meet the global challenge.</p>
                    <p>Our most urgent task is to confront the specter of imminent famine haunting

                        African food relief. We strongly urge that all nations able to contribute
                        foodstuffs or funds join under the leadership of the Food and Agriculture
                        Organization to coordinate relief to drought-afflicted regions. I am happy
                        to note that the Director General will convene a meeting of concerned

                    <p>To help developing countries adjust to oil-driven balance-of-payments
                        deficits, we favor continued improvements in International Monetary Fund
                        facilities, including subsidizing the Supplementary Financing Facility. Such
                        arrangements should receive strong support <pb n="779" facs="0820"
                            xml:id="pg_779"/>from those who prosper as oil prices climb. Private
                        capital flows also will continue to play a critical role. We look forward to
                        the Development Committee’s report on proposals for increasing
                        nonconcessional flows to developing countries.</p>
                    <p>We are committed to the stimulation of energy production worldwide and to the
                        increased use of renewable fuels. The United States strongly supports an
                        expansion of World Bank energy programs, to permit Bank participation in
                        multinational risk-sharing ventures to discover and develop new energy
                        sources. Here, too, as we agreed at the Venice summit, we are open to new
                        institutional and financial arrangements. We will participate positively in
                        the U.N. Conference on New and Renewable Energy Sources.<note n="7"
                            xml:id="d155fn7">The conference took place in Nairobi August 10–21,
                            1981.</note> We urge the U.N. Secretariat and member nations to make
                        every effort to insure its success.</p>
                    <p>Coal is an attractive alternative to high-priced oil. We will expand our
                        capacity to produce and ship coal, and we are ready to help developing
                        countries establish coal-burning facilities and increase their use of
                        coal.</p>
                    <p>We support discussions between oil-exporting and oil-importing nations on
                        ways to insure orderly market conditions and on further assistance for
                        non-oil developing countries.</p>
                    <p>Requests for population program assistance have outpaced the international
                        community’s ability to respond. We are ready to join an international
                        commitment to double, in this decade, the availability and use of
                        family-planning and related health services.</p>
                    <p>On trade, my country would support a pledge by all countries to restrain
                        protectionism and case adjustment. Such a commitment would provide more
                        assured market access to developing countries. Also, beyond the sharp
                        reductions in tariffs already agreed, we are prepared to increase the
                        benefits of our generalized system of preferences for poorer developing
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>These proposals reflect the positive approach we believe our common problems
                        demand and this special session deserves.</p>
                    <p>Let me conclude with this observation. I am persuaded, to the depth of my
                        being, that the challenges ahead are not beyond us. The “Global 2000” report
                        has been described as a reconnaissance of the future. It describes the
                        possibility. I believe it will not be the reality. The vision we share is a
                        vision of opportunity and of peace. It is within our capacity to alter the
                        future to fit that vision. The resources do exist. The solutions can be
                        found. Together we can summon the will. Knowing what is at stake, we must
                        not fail.</p>

                        of East-West relations and an <hi rend="italic">integrating formula</hi> for
                        putting both the resources and a clear sense of strategic direction into our
                        policies toward the Soviet Union in the next four years. You will recognize
                        much of the analysis, but I hope the framework is helpful for tying rhetoric
                        to actions and programs in a comprehensive fashion. The inspiration for this
                        memo comes in part from <persName corresp="#p_HSP_1">Sam
                            Huntington</persName>’s recent paper on U.S.-Soviet relations which he

                        Comprehensive Net Assessment was the reply.<note n="3" xml:id="d156fn3">See

                    <p>1. The military <hi rend="italic">balance</hi> was judged as “essential
                        equivalence” and the <hi rend="italic">trends</hi> as adverse. That judgment
                        looks sound in retrospect.</p>
                    <p>2. In the non-military categories of technology, economics, diplomacy, and
                        political institutions, the U.S. was ahead although the critical
                        military-related technology gap was closing in several areas. In retrospect
                        this judgment has been vindicated.</p>
                    <p>3. In the major regions outside Europe, Soviet prospects were judged best in
                        Africa and the Persian Gulf region. The Caribbean was cited but without
                        alarm. In retrospect, the record is mixed in Africa; Iran as a crisis point
                        was predicted; we were too optimistic about the <pb n="781" facs="0822"

                        than anticipated. In East Asia, our normalization with the <gloss

                    <p>4. In Europe, <gloss target="#t_PRM_1">PRM</gloss>–10 emphasized the
                        certainty of political uncertainty in both Eastern and Western Europe. That
                        judgment remains valid. The emergence of a more traditional German <hi
                            rend="italic">Ostpolitik</hi>, exploited by Moscow in the traditional
                        manner, signals growing difficulties in West-West relations, i.e., within
                        the Alliance. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan has given unambiguous
                        evidence of the strategic interaction between the Persian Gulf region and
                        European-Soviet relations: Soviet power projection that affects the oil
                        states of the Persian Gulf tends to reinforce the accommodationist
                        politicizing forces in Western Europe and thereby exacerbates U.S.-European
                        relations vis-a-vis Moscow and the Persian Gulf.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Transition from Era I to Era II in East-West
                        Relations</p>
                    <p>Critics within the U.S. and abroad have complained that the U.S. has not
                        pursued a steady or consistent course in U.S.-Soviet affairs. The President,
                        in particular, is believed by many to be responsible for this. It is, in
                        their view, all his fault.</p>
                    <p>To some extent, the apparent inconsistency is real. Soviet power projection
                        has been used more extensively in the last few years than even informed
                        policy and intelligence circles believed it would be. “Changing” U.S.
                        policy, therefore, has been “catching up” U.S. policy. Consistent policy
                        outputs are impossible when the inputs differ substantially from those
                        anticipated.</p>
                    <p>To a larger extent the inconsistency is only apparent. It looks that way
                        because the foreign policy and press elites themselves are split on
                        fundamental assumptions about U.S. foreign policy. They are awakening to and
                        becoming disturbed by the transition from the first era in East-West
                        relations—1945 to the mid-1970s (U.S. dominance and Pax Americana)—to the
                        second era—the 1980s and 1990s (the nature of which is still being defined,
                        as Soviet military power makes itself felt). But they are reacting to this
                        awakening in quite different ways. At least three fissures divide foreign
                        policy and media elite views, and perhaps even the broader public, as they
                        assess the incipient realities of Era II.</p>
                    <p>First, there are fundamental differences over the <hi rend="italic">political
                            utility of military force</hi>. At the strategic nuclear level, some
                        believe “assured destruction” is enough. Others believe force balances and
                        capabilities make a political and diplomatic difference. At the conventional
                        level, some argue that our Vietnam experience shows that conventional
                        military power is greatly overrated. Others say that Vietnam proves the
                        importance of using conventional military power effectively, of not
                        squandering it where our interests are small.</p>
                    <pb n="782" facs="0823" xml:id="pg_782"/>
                    <p>The second fissure is <hi rend="italic">East-West versus North-South
                            primacy</hi>, between those who view East-West relations as still the
                        cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy and those who believe that North-South
                        relations rival if not exceed East-West relations for the cornerstone
                        role.</p>
                    <p>The third fissure concerns <hi rend="italic">economics—the growing
                            incongruities between economic power on the one hand</hi> (Europe,
                        Japan, and Saudi Arabia) <hi rend="italic">and military security
                            responsibilities on the other hand</hi> (the U.S. carries them all). It
                        is only vaguely recognized, but it has enormous potential to evoke an
                        “isolationist-internationalist” dichotomy in security policy
                        prescriptions.</p>
                    <p>These fissures prevent a foreign policy consensus on East-West relations and
                        mean that in the 1970s, and perhaps into the 1980s, no U.S. policy toward
                        the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> can have broad and constant
                        support. The domestic need to accommodate both sides of each fissure,
                        particularly in Congress for budgets, inevitably creates the impression, if
                        not the reality, of a wavering U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union and our
                        allies. Thus, blaming the President is far from an adequate explanation.</p>
                    <p>The primary task for U.S. foreign and defense policy in the early 1980s,
                        therefore, is to complete the transition to Era II peacefully and to give
                        that era a definition and direction appropriate to changed realities.
                        Success will depend in part on closing the three fissures, and a compelling
                        formula articulated by the President will help close these. Only their
                        closure will provide the liberal consensus necessary for a sustained
                        realistic policy.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">A U.S. Policy for Era II</p>
                    <p>Era II may or may not be dominated by the U.S. A return to the Cold War is
                        not possible because regaining the military preponderance of that time is
                        not feasible. Were it feasible, a Cold War balance would be the best choice
                        because it was a period relatively secure from general war. A return to
                        detente of the early 1970s is equally infeasible. The Soviets would demand
                        higher terms and be no less aggressive in projecting power into the disputed
                        regions. Even if the Soviet leaders personally desired a relaxation, the
                        centrifugal forces within the <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss>, in the
                        Warsaw Pact, and in client states elsewhere would make it too risky. They
                        are trapped in their own expansive dynamic which limits fundamental
                        choices.</p>
                    <p>Neither the containment policy nor the detente policy alone is adequate to
                        deal effectively with the new level of Soviet power. A more comprehensive
                        approach is essential. The U.S. must neither rely largely on military power
                        nor passively “contain” Soviet power. The U.S. must <hi rend="italic"

                        provide the programs and policies for “competitive engagement” over the next
                        four years. When they are specifically related to the four elements of the
                        policy, a clear view of how to proceed in East-West relations begins to
                        emerge. That follows for each element.</p>

                        objectives and our military capabilities must be reduced. This can be
                        accomplished through simultaneous improvements in our force posture and

                        deficiencies in a three-pronged attack which includes:</p>

                        program choices. To date, they have yielded little to the new doctrine.</p>
                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Organization</hi>. All three agencies must be reorganized
                        to improve “factor productivity,” with particular emphasis on the Pentagon.
                        The President tried to reorganize DoD once, but the effort failed. He
                        succeeded with <gloss target="#t_FEMA_1">FEMA</gloss>. He must succeed in

                        problem. That probably means a return to the military draft.</p>
                    <p>The objective of these measures may not be “military superiority” but it
                        should be “military pre-eminence” for the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss>

                    <p>—<hi rend="italic">Arms Control</hi>. Arms control, too, plays a part in the
                        military balance. Arms control, however, is headed for indefinite dormancy
                        in the 1980s unless it is tied symbiotically to our defense policy. <gloss
                            target="#t_PD_1">PD</gloss>–50 prescribed the process that can achieve
                        that symbiosis. <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss>, State, and even

                        merit in the directive. Yet it is precisely arms control that is at risk
                        without the <gloss target="#t_PD_1">PD</gloss>–50 approach.</p>

                        our assured destruction defense policy of the 1960s. In the 1970s, that
                        policy became inadequate. <gloss target="#t_ACDA_1">ACDA</gloss> and State
                        drifted into the position of seeing arms control as a surrogate for a
                        defense policy. Now we are hesitantly awakening to the defense policy
                        problem in Europe. We cannot move with confidence into <gloss

                        III negotiations because we are in transition with our defense policy. That
                        is not the only defense policy problem for arms control. <gloss

                        not the slightest idea of our force goals for space. No military service has
                        responsibility for them. The same is true for <gloss target="#t_CTB_1"
                            >CTB</gloss>. We have not developed our defense requirements for nuclear
                        weapons development and production of nuclear materials. Yet we are on a

                    <p>Two major <gloss target="#t_PD_1">PD</gloss>–50 tasks must be launched to
                        extract us from this disastrous course on which arms control now proceeds
                        toward self-destruction. First, an across-the-board assessment of all
                        negotiations vis-a-vis one another is essential. Second, a somewhat more

                            fails</hi>.</p>
                    <p>We must devote special attention to the three interrelated strategic regions
                        of Europe, East Asia, and the Persian Gulf. The Caribbean region is also
                        overdue for our security attention as is Southeast Asia.</p>
                    <p>We have major work to accomplish in each area, notwithstanding much that has
                        already been accomplished. <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss>, as
                        mentioned in connection with <gloss target="#t_PD_1">PD</gloss>–50, needs a
                        reassessment of our strategy for its defense. The Persian Gulf Security
                        Framework effort must be kept on track, a separate unified command being one
                        of the first steps next year. For the Caribbean we must begin a similar
                        security framework effort. In East Asia, the nature of military ties with
                        China will need further definition.</p>
                    <p>In addition to these regional activities, some key functional area reviews
                        must be accomplished:</p>
                    <p>—A successful policy of containment depends on capable conventional force
                        projection. We have a modest beginning in the <gloss target="#t_RDF_1"
                            >RDF</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>—Security Assistance policy needs significant revision, budgeting, and
                        perhaps changed legislation.</p>
                    <p>—Our intelligence capabilities in each region must be improved and expanded
                        with all the speed possible.</p>
                    <pb n="785" facs="0826" xml:id="pg_785"/>
                    <p>—Military training assistance and advisory policy needs repair.</p>
                    <p>The most difficult area in the 1980s may prove to be Europe, West-West
                        relations. Overcoming the lag between our own recovery from the hopes of the
                        early 1970s and Europe’s recovery from its present illusion of divisible
                        detente, will not occur without political trauma. How to defend Europe
                        effectively cannot be dodged as it has been for three decades. And until
                        that is decided, arms control within that theater will be difficult to
                        implement in a way that is not politically and militarily injurious to the
                        West. The <gloss target="#t_LTDP_1">LTDP</gloss> was a modest beginning
                        which must be turned into a major revolution in the 1980s.</p>

                            the East</hi>.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Union and East Europe will continue to look to the West as a
                        source of reprieve from their economic plight. The West must exploit that
                        need with offers of economic assistance based on rigorous and measurable
                        political conditions.</p>
                    <p>With the new <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> policies, we have begun
                        to control more effectively the strategic technology transfers. The next
                        step is East-West trade coordination. Credits and trade must be coordinated
                        on an alliance basis. Such a step logically follows from our <gloss
                            target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> policy. Otherwise, the “alternative
                        supplier” problem will continue to deny us the political advantages of our
                        greatest edge over the Soviets—economic advantage. In the “process know-how”
                        proposal to <gloss target="#t_COCOM_1">COCOM</gloss> we have already moved
                        slightly toward trade coordination. That is why Europe resists it. The
                        diplomatic efforts now in progress to prevent the <gloss target="#t_FRG_1"
                            >FRG</gloss> (Kloeckner) and France (Creusot-Loire) from taking our

                            >ALCOA</gloss> deals with the Soviet Union can be the seed from which
                        East-West trade coordination grows. If the Germans believe that Soviet
                        markets are critical for their machine exports, then we can retaliate by
                        denying them our import market. We have strong laws that allow the President
                        to force Europe to choose between the <gloss target="#t_US_1">US</gloss> as
                        a trading partner and the Soviet Bloc as a market. Once the allies are
                        whipped into line, we can dictate the political terms of East-West
                        trade.</p>
                    <p>The Soviets deeply fear a Western united economic front. If we do not present
                        them with one in the 1980s, the incongruities between security burdens and
                        economic power in <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> will create a

                    <p>To sum up, through a strategy of “competitive engagement” the President can,

                        policy developments (as outlined above) that will allow him, rather than the

                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Complexity:</p>
                    <p>Several of the bureaus see a need to convey a greater sense of the complexity
                        of today’s world and the constraints on our freedom of action. We should not
                        minimize the costs or risks associated with our policies, suggest quick or
                        easy fixes, or downplay the degree to which American foreign policy success
                        depends on the support of other nations, such as our <gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> allies or Third World countries.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_NDD_1">David Newsom</persName> singles out four issues
                        that are particularly hard to explain to the American people: Third World
                        demands, unanticipated political change, the relative strength of the U.S.
                        in the world, and the independent views of our allies.</p>
                    <p>A number of the memos suggest that more can be done to make foreign policy
                        seem relevant to everyday concerns. We can stress the economic stakes we
                        have in foreign relations (jobs, resources and the prices paid for imports
                        are three immediate suggestions). We can relate development efforts abroad
                        to pressures to emigrate to the U.S. (<gloss target="#t_OES_1">OES</gloss>),
                        or to narcotics flows (<gloss target="#t_INR_1">INR</gloss>, <gloss
                            target="#t_OES_1">OES</gloss>). A number suggest that we can do more to
                        explain foreign policy in human terms, without oversimplication.</p>
                    <p rend="sectiontitleital">Resources</p>
                    <p>The growing reluctance of Americans to dedicate sufficient resources to
                        foreign affairs, particularly to economic and military assistance, is a
                        commonly recognized problem. It is also agreed that we should actively seek
                        to build support for aid, stressing that it is crucial to our effectiveness
                        in changed international economic and political circumstances. In addition
                        to the competitive (with the Soviets) and humanitarian rationales, we can
                        show that aid helps create stable growing economies which are increasingly
                        important to us as markets for our exports (H, <gloss target="#t_IDCA_1"

                        U.S. influence in the world, yet desires reduced aid levels. We can
                        highlight the cost of aid cuts in terms of influence (<gloss
                            target="#t_NEA_1">NEA</gloss>). One caveat, however: a tendency to
                        exaggerate the benefits of aid in the past is part of our problem today. We
                        should, therefore, be willing to keep expectations reasonable (<gloss

                        speaking to you from the Oval Office of the White House.</p>
                    <p>For the past 4 years, the United States has been at peace. We’ve strengthened
                        the foundations of our security. We have pursued our na<pb n="791"
                            facs="0832" xml:id="pg_791"/>tional interests in a dangerous and often
                        unstable world. And we’ve done so without recourse to violence and war. This
                        is no accident. It’s the result of a careful exercise of the enormous
                        strength of America.</p>
                    <p>Today I want to talk to you about what we must do together in the next 4
                        years to ensure our own security and to keep the peace.</p>
                    <p>The cornerstone of both security and peace is our ability to defend
                        ourselves. In the last analysis we must be able to meet our commitments and
                        pursue our goals peacefully, with calm assurance and confidence. That
                        requires military strength.</p>
                    <p>We face a potential adversary, the Soviet Union, whose government has
                        funneled much of the wealth and talents of its own people into the
                        construction of a military machine. We would prefer to compete peacefully
                        with Soviet farmers to feed the world, with Soviet textile workers to clothe
                        it, with Soviet doctors to heal it, with Soviet scientists to give it new
                        forms of energy. Those races would be a joy to run. But that is not the
                        challenge they lay before us. Instead, we see a large buildup of Soviet
                        military forces; we see the arming and use of client states such as Cuba;
                        and we see the brutal Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>This long-term challenge demands a steady, resolute response. Historically,
                        our country has moved sharply up and down in its support for defense. After
                        each war we have disarmed and demobilized, and then later embarked on crash
                        buildups. Such erratic actions are always wasteful and sometimes
                        dangerous.</p>
                    <p>My commitment has been different. It’s been to provide for a steady
                        rebuilding of our defenses. We’ve increased our real spending for
                        defense—spending above and beyond inflation—every year since I became
                        President. For 7 of the previous 8 years it had declined sharply, a
                        35-percent reduction in defense spending between 1969 and 1977. The effects
                        of this long decline cannot be eliminated at a stroke. But we have made an
                        excellent start, especially by putting our technological superiority to
                        work.</p>
                    <p>For example, by producing a number of types of long-range cruise missiles, we
                        can multiply the power of our existing ships and aircraft. We are doing just
                        that. When I took office, we had no new battle tank or modern armored
                        fighting vehicle. Now they are both in production. No answer had been found
                        to the prospective vulnerability of our Minuteman missiles and silos. Now
                        there’s an answer—the mobile MX missile.</p>
                    <p>There was no overall plan for strengthening United States and other Allied
                        forces in Europe. Now we have a good plan, and we are putting it into
                        effect. We’re deploying antitank missiles at a rate five times faster than
                        the Soviets are deploying their tanks. On <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss>’s <pb n="792" facs="0833" xml:id="pg_792"/>eastern flank,
                        we’re working to reintegrate Greece into the <gloss target="#t_NATO_1"
                            >NATO</gloss> command structure, and we attach great importance to this
                        effort.</p>
                    <p>Our purchases of army equipment, jet fighters, and attack aircraft had
                        dropped by some two-thirds in the 8 years before I became President. Since
                        then, we have increased them by 50 percent.</p>
                    <p>When I came into office, I found that we had little capability for quick
                        action in the critical Persian Gulf region. Now we have prepositioned
                        equipment for 12,000 Marines and munitions for 500 aircraft. We’ve arranged
                        for the use of five different sites in the region. We’ve deployed two
                        carrier task forces in the Indian Ocean. They give us air and naval
                        superiority to act instantly to keep open the Straits of Hormuz, through
                        which much of the world’s oil trade flows.</p>
                    <p>More will have to be done. Even further increases in pay and benefits will be
                        needed to keep trained service men and women in our volunteer forces.
                        Barring some unexpected decrease in Soviet military efforts, we will also
                        need to increase our investments in the ships, aircraft, tanks, and other
                        weapons that are the muscle of our conventional forces. Military forces give
                        us security, but they are not an end in themselves. As I’ve said many times,
                        the best weapon is one which need never be fired in combat, and the best
                        soldier is the one who never has to shed his blood on the field of
                        battle.</p>
                    <p>Besides our military programs, we’ve devised something else, what might be
                        called a secret weapon. This weapon will knock out about a fourth of all the
                        Soviet long-range missiles and bombers that we project for 1985. It will
                        eliminate thousands of nuclear bombs and warheads the Russians could
                        otherwise have. It will enhance our intelligence-gathering capabilities to
                        monitor what the Soviet Union is doing. It will do all this without firing a
                        shot, without interfering with a single one of our own planned military
                        improvements, without costing a dime. Indeed, it will save us billions of
                        dollars.</p>
                    <p>This secret weapon, of course, is not a weapon at all. Nor is it a secret. It
                        is <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II, the strategic arms limitation
                        treaty which we have signed after 7 years of negotiations with the Soviet
                        Union, and which now awaits approval by the Senate.</p>
                    <p>This agreement strengthens our strategic position. It also strengthens peace,
                        for what is at stake is more than a single treaty, however advantageous.
                        What is at stake is a process, an extremely important process, the process
                        of gradually reducing the possibility of nuclear war.</p>
                    <p>Thirty-five years after Hiroshima, the shadow of what was unleashed there
                        still hangs over the world. We’ve lived with it for so long that we are in
                        danger of becoming casual about it. We must not do that. Even a single
                        hydrogen bomb dropped on a single major city could cause millions of deaths
                        and injuries in the first few seconds and mil<pb n="793" facs="0834"
                            xml:id="pg_793"/>lions more in its wake. It is beyond the power of words
                        to describe the horror of a nuclear holocaust. It would dwarf all the
                        accumulated barbarities and cruelties of mankind’s long history put
                        together. More people would die in a few hours than in all the wars of all
                        nations since the dawn of recorded history.</p>
                    <p>Most of us seldom think seriously about the possibility of nuclear war. But
                        as the President of the United States, entrusted with the power to unleash
                        that force, charged with the responsibility to bend every effort of mind and
                        heart and will to see to it that it need never be unleashed, then it is
                        something I think about every day and every night of my life.</p>
                    <p>Over the last 20 years we’ve taken some tentative steps away from the nuclear
                        precipice. Now, for the first time, we are being advised to take steps that
                        may move us toward it.</p>
                    <p>A few days ago my opponent in the current election campaign promised to scrap
                        the nuclear arms treaty we’ve already signed. He said, and I quote, “The one
                        card that’s been missing in these negotiations is the possibility of an arms
                            race.”<note n="2" xml:id="d158fn2">During a September 30 interview with
                            Associated Press reporters, <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                                >Reagan</persName> offered this statement in response to questions
                            as to whether he would begin arms talks with Soviet leaders at present
                            military strength levels or wait until the United States had achieved
                            parity with the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                                >Reagan</persName> commented that the Soviets would “be more
                            inclined to negotiate in good faith” if they knew that the United States
                            “is engaged in building up its military.” Responding to a follow-on
                            question if this meant that the United States should not wait to start
                            new negotiations, <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                            asserted: “No, I think that if you start, they know our industrial
                            strength. They know our capacity. The one card that’s been missing in
                            these negotiations has been the possibility of an arms race. Now the
                            Soviets have been racing, but with no competition. No one else is
                            racing. Now they know the difference between their industrial power and
                            ours. And so I think that we’d get a lot farther at the table if they
                            know that as they continue, they’re faced with our industrial capacity
                            and all that we can do.” (“<persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"

                            “Excerpts From <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Interview
                            on Policies He Would Follow,” both <hi rend="italic">The New York

                        seek nuclear superiority. His position—and I think I state it accurately—is
                        that by abandoning the current agreement and suggesting an all-out nuclear
                        arms race, we could perhaps frighten the Soviets into negotiating a new
                        agreement on the basis of American nuclear superiority.</p>
                    <p>I’ve had 4 years of sobering experience in this life-and-death field, and in
                        my considered judgment this would be a very risky gamble. It is most
                        unlikely that it would lead to any new agreement. A much more likely result
                        would be an uncontrolled nuclear arms race and almost certainly a new
                        rupture in Soviet-American relations. The long, slow momentum of arms
                        control would be broken. Any future effort to negotiate arms limits—for
                        example, on antisatellite systems, on nuclear weapons tests, on conventional
                        and nuclear arms in Europe—would all be imperiled.</p>

                    <p>The most important duty of a President is to defend the Nation and its vital
                        interests. Part of that duty is to judge what course of action will diminish
                        the possibility of nuclear war. My considered judgment, based on a very
                        thorough knowledge of all the factors involved, is that the course I am
                        following would do that, and that the departure recommended by my opponent
                        would have just the opposite effect.</p>
                    <p>His argument is not with me alone. It is with our allies who, without
                        exception, support both the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> treaty
                        and the continuing process of nuclear arms control. His position is a
                        departure from the policies of President <persName corresp="#p_THS_1"
                            >Truman</persName>, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD_1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName>, and all Democratic and Republican Presidents who
                        have served in this office since then. Whatever their other differences, all
                        of them saw a duty to slow the arms race and to bring the terrible weapons
                        of nuclear annihilation under some kind of rational control.</p>
                    <p>I do not propose to turn away from that duty. I propose to lead our country
                        in fulfilling it.</p>
                    <p>Though we must continue to work for arms control, which is in our mutual
                        interest, we must recognize that Soviet-American relations have grown colder
                        in the wake of the invasion of Afghanistan. The world has condemned this act
                        of aggression, and the Soviets are being made to realize that this military
                        occupation of a freedom-loving nation cannot be continued without severe
                        adverse consequences. But we must not let ourselves become obsessed by fear
                        and rivalry. If we do, we run the risk of neglecting the many other problems
                        which are related to the Soviet Union only indirectly or not at all.</p>
                    <p>Peace is the work of many hands. It’s the struggle for justice in many dark
                        corners. It is striving to solve problems long stalemated and bitterly
                        disputed. It’s having the courage to rise above old failures and to act upon
                        new hope. As we raise our shield against war, let us also hear the stricken
                        voice of the homeless refugee, the cry of the hungry child, the weeping of
                        the bereaved widow, the whispered prayer of the political prisoner. We are
                        one with the family of all people, and the concerns to the human family are
                        many. Around the world we’ve rejected the counsels of pessimism and have
                        dared to make progress toward peace.</p>
                    <p>In the Far East, we’ve placed our relations with China on an honest and
                        sensible footing. This makes the global balance of power more stable and
                        strengthens peace both in Asia and around the world.</p>
                    <p>In the Middle East, 7 years ago this month, there was war—the fourth
                        Arab-Israeli war in just 25 years. Today Egypt and Israel are at peace, and
                        Israel is more secure from attack than she has ever been. We’ve recognized
                        the strategic interrelationship between Israel’s security and our own. When
                        I first met President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName> at the
                        White House in April 1977, I told him that I intended to work for a complete
                        peace <pb n="795" facs="0836" xml:id="pg_795"/>between his country and
                        Israel—acknowledgement of the right to exist, direct negotiations, open
                        borders, diplomatic recognition, ambassadorial exchange, and mutual
                            trade.<note n="3" xml:id="d158fn3">See <ref target="#d44fn5">footnote 5,
                                Document 44</ref>.</note> He told me that he too longed for that
                        day, but it would never happen in his lifetime. Prime Minister <persName
                            corresp="#p_BM_1">Begin</persName> shared his dream and his skepticism.
                        Now that dream has come to pass, in their lifetime and in yours and
                        mine.</p>
                    <p>We have much more work to do. But we have fundamentally changed the situation
                        in the Middle East. The question is no longer Israel’s right to exist. The
                        question now is the terms of a broader peace between a strong and secure
                        Israel and her neighbors.</p>
                    <p>A bitter war is now going on in the Persian Gulf, complicating even further
                        our efforts to obtain the release of our hostages in Iran.<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d158fn4">Reference is to the Iran-Iraq war which began in
                            September.</note> Think how much more dangerous that new war would be if
                        we did not have peace between Israel and Egypt, by far the most significant
                        military powers in the region. We will continue to consult closely with
                        Israel and with Egypt on strategic matters of mutual interest in our common
                        effort to preserve the peace.</p>
                    <p>In southern Africa 4 years ago, it was clear that time was running out for
                        regimes based on the doctrine of racial supremacy. I’m proud that because
                        we’ve recognized this fact, we could help with the peaceful settlement that
                        this year brought a democratically elected government to power in Zimbabwe.
                        We’ve developed excellent relations with Nigeria and other independent
                        nations on the African Continent. There, as elsewhere, we’ve placed
                        America’s influence on the side of human forces that inevitably shape the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>In Central America, a new and more just social order is emerging. We approve
                        that struggle for justice, and at the same time we affirm our faith that
                        economic reform can best be achieved when human rights are respected. I’m
                        convinced that the people of Central America can find their way forward,
                        leaving old injustices, without submitting to new tyrannies. As Americans,
                        we all have reason to be proud of our new relationship with Panama, a
                        relationship that has turned an isthmus of discord into a zone of peace.</p>
                    <p>I’ve sought to guide us in the spirit of liberty and peace. When we lose
                        touch with that spirit, when we begin to think of our power as an end in
                        itself, when we begin to think that the only source of respect is the threat
                        of force, then we lose the best that is within us.</p>
                    <p>We seek a world in which the rule of law, not the threat of force, is the
                        language of statecraft. We seek a world in which nations put aside the
                        madness of war and nuclear arms races and turn their energies in<pb n="796"
                            facs="0837" xml:id="pg_796"/>stead to the conquest of our common global
                        enemies—dwindling resources, ecological decay, ignorance, and hunger.</p>
                    <p>No one can guarantee you a future of unvarying success. I certainly do not
                        promise you that. Nor will I tell you that the transition from the troubled
                        world of today to the hoped for world of tomorrow will be an easy one. I
                        promise you only that if you entrust the responsibilities of this office to
                        me for another 4 years, this Nation will have the strength to be secure, and
                        I will continue to find peace by seeking solutions to the real problems, the
                        hard problems. I will do so with both hope and realism, with both
                        determination and restraint.</p>
                    <p>We will keep our Nation strong. But this I can say to you: Peace is my
                        passion. And within the limits of the wisdom and opportunity God grants me,
                        peace is my pledge.</p>

                            pp. 2476–2502. In his diary entry for October 28, the President noted:
                            “In the debate itself it was hard to judge the general demeanor that was
                            projected to the viewers. <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                            was ’Aw, shucks’. . . this and that . . . ’I’m a grandfather, and I
                            would never get this nation in a war’ . . . and ’I love peace . . . ’ He
                            has his memorized tapes. He pushes a button, and they come out. He
                            apparently made a better impression on the TV audience than I did, but I
                            made all our points to the constituency groups—which we believe will
                            become preeminent in the public’s mind as they approach the point a week
                            from now of actually going to the polls. Both sides felt good after the
                            debate. We’ll see whose basic strategy is best when the returns come in
                            next Tuesday.” (<hi rend="italic">White House Diary,</hi> p. 476)</note>

                    </list>
                    <p>It is important that in the debate you not only demonstrate a superior
                        knowledge of foreign affairs (which you clearly have) but also <pb n="797"
                            facs="0838" xml:id="pg_797"/>convey to the public several broad themes,
                        which show clearly the contrast between you and <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                            >Reagan</persName>. The war/peace theme is the obvious one, but in the
                        discussion of foreign affairs you may want to relate any specific comments
                        to two or three broader themes, contrasting your foreign policy with
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s. By emphasizing such
                        broader themes, the public will get a better sense of your statesmanship, in
                        contrast to <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s sloganeering.
                        To the extent possible, every comment on foreign policy should reflect the
                        themes discussed more fully below.</p>
                    <p>The distinctive quality of your foreign policy is that it combines respect
                        for morality with the recognition of the importance of power in world
                        affairs. When you assumed office in 1977, you set yourself two central
                        tasks:</p>
                    <p>1. To improve America’s political position in the world, overcoming the
                        isolation in which America found itself after eight years of Republican rule
                        and fifteen years of the Vietnam war;</p>
                    <p>2. To improve America’s strategic position, after eight years of Republican
                        neglect of our strategic needs and some fifteen years of a sustained Soviet
                        defense effort.</p>
                    <p>As a consequence, you have succeeded in greatly improving our relations with
                        the Third World, in identifying America through your human rights policy
                        with the basic aspirations of our time (and this is why you have a right to
                        be <hi rend="italic">optimistic</hi> in your historical vision), and your
                        various concrete policy successes reflect this progress (Panama, Zimbabwe,
                        Camp David, China, etc.). It is important that in your comments you
                        emphasize this theme, noting that <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                            >Reagan</persName>’s administration would be likely to produce again <hi
                            rend="italic">America’s global isolation</hi>.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, you have not neglected the dimension of power. Here you
                        have pursued a sophisticated policy of emphasizing arms control with a
                        long-term effort to improve our overall defense posture (<gloss
                            target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> modernization, <gloss target="#t_RDF_1"
                            >RDF</gloss>, MX, Trident, <gloss target="#t_PD_1">PD</gloss>–59).
                        Moreover, the normalization of relations with China has also contributed to
                        an improved strategic situation for the United States. By moving forward
                        with <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss>, you have held out the
                        possibility of a greatly reduced or even contained arms race, and that too
                        enhances our security.</p>
                    <p>In effect, your foreign policy has been responsive to the fact that we live
                        in an age of complexity, and that the President has to make careful and
                        mature judgments, weighing carefully a variety of trade-offs while avoiding
                        simplistic slogans. You have done this throughout by stressing the
                        proposition that <hi rend="italic">on the one hand America must positively
                            identify itself with global change (and thus also improve its own
                            political position in the world) and on the other hand remain strong,
                            both through its system of alliances as well as its own defense
                            effort</hi>.</p>
                    <pb n="798" facs="0839" xml:id="pg_798"/>
                    <p>Accordingly, your foreign policy, by combining the ability to work with the
                        new forces in the world with an emphasis on American strength, is more
                        likely to generate a condition of global peace and gradual accommodation of
                        regional or ideological disputes.</p>
                    <p>All of the foregoing enables you to state confidently and very affirmatively
                        that “tyranny is everywhere on the defensive”; that “free-dom is the genuine
                        inevitability of our times”; that “American principles and values are
                        relevant to our times.” These optimistic themes regarding the future follow
                        logically from your broad approach to the world.</p>
                    <p>In contrast, <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s foreign policy
                        can be defined as:</p>
                    <p>1. Dominated by a nostalgia for the past;</p>
                    <p>2. Preoccupied one-dimensionally with weaponry.</p>
                    <p>The nostalgia for the conditions of the fifties, a time of unique American
                        military and economic preponderance, shows the degree to which <persName
                            corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> has no sense of history and
                        particularly no vision for the future. Neither our relations with the Third
                        World nor our relations with the Soviet Union can be shaped in the eighties
                        on the basis of what existed thirty years ago. Any effort to do so is simply
                        likely to produce America’s isolation in a hostile world. At the same time,
                            <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s one-dimensional
                        preoccupation with weaponry is likely to precipitate an arms race while
                        giving the Soviets no incentive to exercise any restraint, be it in the
                        Persian Gulf area or in regard to Poland. It is likely to generate more
                        intense confrontations and thus threaten world peace.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the foregoing, it might be also possible to register
                        subtly the relevance of <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>’s
                        advanced age to our concerns with the future. The decade of the eighties
                        cannot be managed by an America led by an aged President, dominated by
                        nostalgia for the past. America must convey a vital message to the world,
                        80% of whose population is composed of politically awakened Third World
                        peoples, most of them quite young. A world of change and youth requires a
                        vital and forward-looking America.</p>
                    <p>To conclude, the three themes which you should have very clearly in your mind
                        as you speak are:</p>
                    <p>1. That your foreign policy reflects an optimistic recognition of the nature
                        of change in the world and America’s ability to convey a morally relevant
                        sense of direction to that world;</p>
                    <p>2. That under your stewardship American strength has been increased, our
                        Allies have been strengthened, and our strategic position in the world has
                        also improved;</p>
                    <p>3. That the proper response to complex global change is not nostalgia for the
                        fifties.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Jimmy Carter</persName>.</p>
                    <p>I have been blessed as only a few people ever have, to help shape the destiny
                        of this Nation. In that effort I’ve had your faithful support. In some ways
                        I’ve been the most fortunate of Presidents, because I’ve had the daily aid
                        of a wise man and a good man at my side, in my judgment the best Vice
                        President anybody ever had, <persName corresp="#p_MWF_1">Fritz
                            Mondale</persName>.</p>
                    <p>I’ve not achieved all I set out to do; perhaps no one ever does. But we have
                        faced the tough issues. We’ve stood for and we’ve fought for and we have
                        achieved some very important goals for our country. These efforts will not
                        end with this administration. The effort must go on. Nor will the progress
                        that we have made be lost when we leave office. The great principles that
                        have guided this Nation since its very founding will continue to guide
                        America through the challenges of the future.</p>
                    <p>This has been a long and hard-fought campaign, as you well know. But we must
                        now come together as a united and a unified people to solve the problems
                        that are still before us, to meet the challenges of a new decade. And I urge
                        all of you to join in with me in a sincere and fruitful effort to support my
                        successor when he undertakes this great responsibility as President of the
                        greatest nation on Earth.</p>
                    <p>Ours is a special country, because our vast economic and military strength
                        gives us a special responsibility for seeking solutions to the problems that
                        confront the world. But our influence will always be greater when we live up
                        to those principles of freedom, of justice, of human rights, for all
                        people.</p>
                    <p>God has been good to me, and God has been good to this country, and I’m truly
                        thankful. I’m thankful for having been able to serve you in this capacity,
                        thankful for the successes that we have had, thankful that to the end you
                        were with me and every good thing that I tried to do.</p>
                    <p>There’s an old Yiddish proverb that I’ve often thought of in the days and
                        months that I’ve held this office. It says simply, “God gives burdens; also
                        shoulders.” In all the days and months when I have served you and served
                        this country, you’ve readily given me your shoulders, your faith, and your
                        prayers. No man could ask any more of his friends.</p>
                    <p>I’ve wanted to serve as President because I love this country and because I
                        love the people of this Nation. Finally, let me say that I am disappointed
                        tonight, but I have not lost either love.</p>
                    <p>Thank you very much.</p>

                    <p>1. The President opened the meeting by expressing his gratitude to the
                        members of the Cabinet for their work during his administration. He
                        commented on their fine working relationship, and said they had made a
                        significant contribution to the country. He said the transition had been
                        both graceful and generous so far, and mentioned that his meeting with
                        President-elect <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> had gone
                            well.<note n="2" xml:id="d161fn2">The President met with <persName

                    </p>
                    <p>—The President reminded the Cabinet that this administration still had the
                        authority and responsibility to run the government and urged them not to be
                        timid in exercising that authority.</p>
                    <p>—The President encouraged the Cabinet to compile an accurate historical
                        record of their time in office, and to be aggressive in disseminating that
                        record.</p>
                    <p>—The President also reported his plans to return to Plains, Georgia, after
                        the inauguration. He said he and his family would make their home there,
                        although he would spend some portion of his time in Atlanta, where the
                        Presidential papers would be housed until a library is built.</p>
                    <p>—The President told the Cabinet they would be receiving information prepared
                        by <persName corresp="#p_CLN_1">Lloyd Cutler</persName>, Counsel to the
                        President, concerning the identification and handling of Presidential

                    <p>—The President commented on the preparation of the <gloss target="#t_FY_1"
                            >FY</gloss> 1982 budget. He said it would be restrained while at the
                        same time honoring commitments of the Democratic Party. He praised the
                        Congress for its recent approval of the Alaska Lands Bill, and the creation
                        of a “superfund” to clean up toxic wastes. The President asked if any
                        Cabinet members wanted to make any comment.</p>
                    <p>2. The Vice President began his remarks by stating that history would deal
                        more kindly with the <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName>
                        Administration than had the voters.</p>
                    <p>—He mentioned especially the record established in behalf of human rights,
                        saying that the U.S. had asserted fundamental American values.</p>
                    <p>—He said that the U.S. had been at peace during the <persName
                            corresp="#p_CJE2_1">Carter</persName> years, and noted the absence of
                        any major scandal touching the presidency. Finally, the Vice President
                        praised Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_CER_1">Carter</persName> for her graceful
                        tenure as First Lady.</p>

                        >Muskie</persName>.]</p>
                    <p>8. The President commented on some of the difficulties in providing
                        leadership to the Western Alliance.</p>
                    <p>—The President also reviewed the difficulties involved in achieving the
                        release of the American hostages in Iran, while noting that over 50,000
                        Americans had been safely removed from that country.</p>
                    <p>—He reported that the last U.S. response to Iran’s conditions for the
                        hostages’ release preserved American honor and integrity.</p>
                    <p>—The President also expressed his appreciation for Ambassador <persName
                            corresp="#p_LSM_1">Linowitz</persName>’s work on the Egyptian/Israeli
                        negotiations. He said he encouraged President-elect <persName
                            corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> to maintain the Camp David process
                        and stated that both President <persName corresp="#p_SA_1">Sadat</persName>
                        and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_BM_1">Begin</persName> want it to
                        continue.</p>
                    <p>—Finally, the President expressed the hope that the new administration would
                        state publicly that the new provisions of <gloss target="#t_SALT_1"
                            >SALT</gloss> II would govern American policy until either the Treaty
                        was ratified or new agreements were achieved. The President observed that
                        the <gloss target="#t_SALT_1">SALT</gloss> II Treaty effectively protects
                        U.S. interests.</p>
                    <p>9. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName> noted that a
                        dramatic change had occurred in the American public’s attitudes toward
                        defense in the last four years. He said he believed a consensus had emerged
                        in support of a responsible growth in military power. Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_BH_1">Brown</persName> pointed out that there were greater
                        moral restraints on our use of power than the Soviets. He concluded with a
                        statement of personal respect for the President.</p>
                    <p>10. The President responded by saying he thought relationships between the
                        State Department, Defense Department and <gloss target="#t_NSC_1"
                            >NSC</gloss> had been <pb n="803" facs="0844" xml:id="pg_803"/>mostly
                        harmonious. He suggested that reports of divisions had been exaggerated by
                        the press. The President said he had made the final decisions, and that he
                        was proud of the Administration’s legacy in foreign affairs.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here are comments by <persName corresp="#p_AR_2"
                        >Askew</persName>.]</p>
                    <p>12. The President commented that many of the Administration’s foreign policy
                        initiatives had been difficult politically, but were good for the
                        country.</p>
                    <p>13. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BZK_1">Brzezinski</persName>, Assistant to the
                        President for National Security, observed that the President had fashioned a
                        foreign policy that fused principle with power. He said that these two
                        concepts no longer needed to be viewed as antithetical. He also warned that
                        the foreign affairs of the U.S. could not be conducted effectively without a
                        President who takes an active role in them.</p>

                        >Harris</persName>.]</p>
                    <p>15. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MDF_1">McHenry</persName> praised the
                        President for his sensitivity to civil rights issues, as well as the opening
                        toward Africa. He said that during the <persName corresp="#p_CJE2_1"
                            >Carter</persName> Administration relations with the new nations of
                        Africa were greatly strengthened.</p>
                    <p>[Omitted here are comments by the President and <persName corresp="#p_HSA_1"

                    <p>18. The President concluded the Cabinet Meeting at 12:10 p.m. by expressing
                        the hope that the achievements of the Administration would be neither
                        denigrated or ignored. The President and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_CER_1"
                            >Carter</persName> left the Cabinet Room to standing and sustained
                        applause.</p>

                            pp. 2890–2893. The President spoke at 9 p.m. from the Oval Office at the
                            White House. His remarks were broadcast live on radio and television. In
                            his diary entry for January 14, the President wrote: “I delivered the
                            farewell address, and the response was good. I described the pressure of
                            special interest groups, how they fragment the country. Primarily I
                            emphasized, however, the threat of nuclear destruction, environmental
                            issues, and consideration for human rights. These are the same themes I
                            used in my acceptance speech in 1976, my inaugural address four years
                            ago, and that I pursued when I was president.” (<hi rend="italic">White

                    <p>In a few days I will lay down my official responsibilities in this office, to
                        take up once more the only title in our democracy superior to that of
                        President, the title of citizen.</p>
                    <p>Of Vice President <persName corresp="#p_MWF_1">Mondale</persName>, my
                        Cabinet, and the hundreds of others who have served with me during the last
                        4 years, I wish to say now publicly what I have said in private: I thank
                        them for the dedication and competence they’ve brought to the service of our
                        country. But I owe my deepest thanks to you, to the American people, because
                        you gave me this extraordinary opportunity to serve.</p>
                    <p>We’ve faced great challenges together, and we know that future problems will
                        also be difficult. But I’m now more convinced than ever that the United
                        States, better than any other country, can meet successfully whatever the
                        future might bring. These last 4 years have made me more certain than ever
                        of the inner strength of our country, the unchanging value of our principles
                        and ideals, the stability of our political system, the ingenuity and the
                        decency of our people.</p>
                    <pb n="811" facs="0852" xml:id="pg_811"/>
                    <p>Tonight I would like first to say a few words about this most special office,
                        the Presidency of the United States. This is at once the most powerful
                        office in the world and among the most severely constrained by law and
                        custom. The President is given a broad responsibility to lead but cannot do
                        so without the support and consent of the people, expressed formally through
                        the Congress and informally in many ways through a whole range of public and
                        private institutions. This is as it should be.</p>
                    <p>Within our system of government every American has a right and a duty to help
                        shape the future course of the United States. Thoughtful criticism and close
                        scrutiny of all government officials by the press and the public are an
                        important part of our democratic society. Now, as in the past, only the
                        understanding and involvement of the people through full and open debate can
                        help to avoid serious mistakes and assure the continued dignity and safety
                        of the Nation.</p>
                    <p>Today we are asking our political system to do things of which the Founding
                        Fathers never dreamed. The government they designed for a few hundred
                        thousand people now serves a nation of almost 230 million people. Their
                        small coastal republic now spans beyond a continent, and we also now have
                        the responsibility to help lead much of the world through difficult times to
                        a secure and prosperous future.</p>
                    <p>Today, as people have become ever more doubtful of the ability of the
                        Government to deal with our problems, we are increasingly drawn to
                        single-issue groups and special interest organizations to ensure that
                        whatever else happens, our own personal views and our own private interests
                        are protected. This is a disturbing factor in American political life. It
                        tends to distort our purposes, because the national interest is not always
                        the sum of all our single or special interests. We are all Americans
                        together, and we must not forget that the common good is our common interest
                        and our individual responsibility.</p>
                    <p>Because of the fragmented pressures of these special interests, it’s very
                        important that the office of the President be a strong one and that its
                        constitutional authority be preserved. The President is the only elected
                        official charged with the primary responsibility of representing all the
                        people. In the moments of decision, after the different and conflicting
                        views have all been aired, it’s the President who then must speak to the
                        Nation and for the Nation.</p>
                    <p>I understand after 4 years in this office, as few others can, how formidable
                        is the task the new President-elect is about to undertake, and to the very
                        limits of conscience and conviction, I pledge to support him in that task. I
                        wish him success, and Godspeed.</p>
                    <p>I know from experience that Presidents have to face major issues that are
                        controversial, broad in scope, and which do not arouse the natural support
                        of a political majority. For a few minutes now, I want to <pb n="812"
                            facs="0853" xml:id="pg_812"/>lay aside my role as leader of one nation,
                        and speak to you as a fellow citizen of the world about three issues, three
                        difficult issues: the threat of nuclear destruction, our stewardship of the
                        physical resources of our planet, and the preeminence of the basic rights of
                        human beings.</p>
                    <p>It’s now been 35 years since the first atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima. The
                        great majority of the world’s people cannot remember a time when the nuclear
                        shadow did not hang over the Earth. Our minds have adjusted to it, as after
                        a time our eyes adjust to the dark. Yet the risk of a nuclear conflagration
                        has not lessened. It has not happened yet, thank God, but that can give us
                        little comfort, for it only has to happen once.</p>
                    <p>The danger is becoming greater. As the arsenals of the superpowers grow in
                        size and sophistication and as other governments, perhaps even in the future
                        dozens of governments, acquire these weapons, it may only be a matter of
                        time before madness, desperation, greed, or miscalculation lets loose this
                        terrible force.</p>
                    <p>In an all-out nuclear war, more destructive power than in all of World War II
                        would be unleashed every second during the long afternoon it would take for
                        all the missiles and bombs to fall. A World War II every second—more people
                        killed in the first few hours than in all the wars of history put together.
                        The survivors, if any, would live in despair amid the poisoned ruins of a
                        civilization that had committed suicide.</p>
                    <p>National weakness, real or perceived, can tempt aggression and thus cause
                        war. That’s why the United States can never neglect its military strength.
                        We must and we will remain strong. But with equal determination, the United
                        States and all countries must find ways to control and to reduce the
                        horrifying danger that is posed by the enormous world stockpiles of nuclear
                        arms.</p>
                    <p>This has been a concern of every American President since the moment we first
                        saw what these weapons could do. Our leaders will require our understanding
                        and our support as they grapple with this difficult but crucial challenge.
                        There is no disagreement on the goals or the basic approach to controlling
                        this enormous destructive force. The answer lies not just in the attitudes
                        or the actions of world leaders but in the concern and the demands of all of
                        us as we continue our struggle to preserve the peace.</p>
                    <p>Nuclear weapons are an expression of one side of our human character. But
                        there’s another side. The same rocket technology that delivers nuclear
                        warheads has also taken us peacefully into space. From that perspective, we
                        see our Earth as it really is—a small and fragile and beautiful blue globe,
                        the only home we have. We see no barriers of race or religion or country. We
                        see the essential unity of our species and <pb n="813" facs="0854"
                            xml:id="pg_813"/>our planet. And with faith and common sense, that
                        bright vision will ultimately prevail.</p>
                    <p>Another major challenge, therefore, is to protect the quality of this world
                        within which we live. The shadows that fall across the future are cast not
                        only by the kinds of weapons we’ve built, but by the kind of world we will
                        either nourish or neglect. There are real and growing dangers to our simple
                        and our most precious possessions: the air we breathe, the water we drink,
                        and the land which sustains us. The rapid depletion of irreplaceable
                        minerals, the erosion of topsoil, the destruction of beauty, the blight of
                        pollution, the demands of increasing billions of people, all combine to
                        create problems which are easy to observe and predict, but difficult to
                        resolve. If we do not act, the world of the year 2000 will be much less able
                        to sustain life than it is now.</p>
                    <p>But there is no reason for despair. Acknowledging the physical realities of
                        our planet does not mean a dismal future of endless sacrifice. In fact,
                        acknowledging these realities is the first step in dealing with them. We can
                        meet the resource problems of the world—water, food, minerals, farmlands,
                        forests, overpopulation, pollution—if we tackle them with courage and
                        foresight.</p>
                    <p>I’ve just been talking about forces of potential destruction that mankind has
                        developed and how we might control them. It’s equally important that we
                        remember the beneficial forces that we have evolved over the ages and how to
                        hold fast to them. One of those constructive forces is the enhancement of
                        individual human freedoms through the strengthening of democracy and the
                        fight against deprivation, torture, terrorism, and the persecution of people
                        through the world. The struggle for human rights overrides all differences
                        of color or nation or language. Those who hunger for freedom, who thirst for
                        human dignity, and who suffer for the sake of justice, they are the patriots
                        of this cause.</p>
                    <p>I believe with all my heart that America must always stand for these basic
                        human rights at home and abroad. That is both our history and our
                        destiny.</p>
                    <p>America did not invent human rights. In a very real sense, it’s the other way
                        around. Human rights invented America. Ours was the first nation in the
                        history of the world to be founded explicitly on such an idea. Our social
                        and political progress has been based on one fundamental principle: the
                        value and importance of the individual. The fundamental force that unites us
                        is not kinship or place of origin or religious preference. The love of
                        liberty is the common blood that flows in our American veins.</p>
                    <p>The battle for human rights, at home and abroad, is far from over. We should
                        never be surprised nor discouraged, because the impact of <pb n="814"
                            facs="0855" xml:id="pg_814"/>our efforts has had and will always have
                        varied results. Rather, we should take pride that the ideals which gave
                        birth to our Nation still inspire the hopes of oppressed people around the
                        world. We have no cause for self-righteousness or complacency, but we have
                        every reason to persevere, both within our own country and beyond our
                        borders.</p>
                    <p>If we are to serve as a beacon for human rights, we must continue to perfect
                        here at home the rights and the values which we espouse around the world: a
                        decent education for our children, adequate medical care for all Americans,
                        an end to discrimination against minorities and women, a job for all those
                        able to work, and freedom from injustice and religious intolerance.</p>
                    <p>We live in a time of transition, an uneasy era which is likely to endure for
                        the rest of this century. It will be a period of tensions, both within
                        nations and between nations, of competition for scarce resources, of social,
                        political, and economic stresses and strains. During this period we may be
                        tempted to abandon some of the time-honored principles and commitments which
                        have been proven during the difficult times of past generations. We must
                        never yield to this temptation. Our American values are not luxuries, but
                        necessities—not the salt in our bread, but the bread itself. Our common
                        vision of a free and just society is our greatest source of cohesion at home
                        and strength abroad, greater even than the bounty of our material
                        blessings.</p>
                    <p>Remember these words: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
                        are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
                        inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of
                        Happiness.”</p>
                    <p>This vision still grips the imagination of the world. But we know that
                        democracy is always an unfinished creation. Each generation must renew its
                        foundations. Each generation must rediscover the meaning of this hallowed
                        vision in the light of its own modern challenges. For this generation, ours,
                        life is nuclear survival; liberty is human rights; the pursuit of happiness
                        is a planet whose resources are devoted to the physical and spiritual
                        nourishment of its inhabitants.</p>
                    <p>During the next few days I will work hard to make sure that the transition
                        from myself to the next President is a good one, that the American people
                        are served well. And I will continue, as I have the last 14 months, to work
                        hard and to pray for the lives and the well-being of the American hostages
                        held in Iran. I can’t predict yet what will happen, but I hope you will join
                        me in my constant prayer for their freedom.</p>
                    <p>As I return home to the South, where I was born and raised, I look forward to
                        the opportunity to reflect and further to assess, I hope with <pb n="815"
                            facs="0856" xml:id="pg_815"/>accuracy, the circumstances of our times. I
                        intend to give our new President my support, and I intend to work as a
                        citizen, as I’ve worked here in this office as President, for the values
                        this Nation was founded to secure.</p>
                    <p>Again, from the bottom of my heart, I want to express to you the gratitude I
                        feel. Thank you, fellow citizens, and farewell.</p>
