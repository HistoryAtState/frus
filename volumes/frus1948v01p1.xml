                        constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States.
                        These volumes include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                        documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                        decisions within the range of the Department of State’s responsibilities,
                        together with appropriate materials concerning the facts which contributed
                        to the formulation of policies. When further material is needed to
                        supplement the documentation in the Department’s files for a proper
                        understanding of the relevant policies of the United States, such papers
                        should be obtained from other Government agencies.</p>

                            >Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> is edited by the Historical

                        the record is guided by the principles of historical objectivity. There may
                        be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in the
                        text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of major
                        importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose of
                        concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                        policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the

                        the United States Mission to the United Nations (<gloss target="#t_USUN1"
                            >USUN</gloss>); United States Representative on the Security Council;
                        Senior United States Representative on the United States Delegation to the
                        General Assembly, when a delegation was in existence and in the absence of
                        the President of the United States and/or the Secretary of State; United
                        States Representative on the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission; and
                        United States Representative on the Commission on Conventional Armaments (of
                        the Security Council). At the beginning of 1948 the holder of these several
                        positions was Warren R. Austin, formerly United States Senator from Vermont,
                        who held the personal rank of Ambassador Extraordinary and
                        Plenipotentiary.</p>
                    <p>Other United States officers at the United Nations holding the rank of United
                        States Representative included (at the beginning of 1948) the United States
                        Representative on the Economic and Social Council, Mr. Willard R. Thorp, and
                        the United States Representative on the Trusteeship Council, Mr. Francis B.
                        Sayre. Members of a United States Delegation to the General Assembly (as
                        appointed for particular sessions of the General Assembly) were designated
                        as United States Representatives. All functioned under the United States
                        Representative at the United Nations.</p>

                    <p>The 1945 Participation Act made no provision for a Deputy Representative of
                        the United States at the United Nations. This anomalous situation was
                        engaging the attention of the appropriate officers of the Department of
                        State at the beginning of 1948.</p>
                    <p>At the opening of the year Ambassador Herschel V. Johnson, an officer of the
                        Foreign Service of the United States, represented the United States at the
                        United Nations as Deputy United States Representative on the Security
                        Council. Ambassador Johnson was also Deputy Chief of the United States
                        Mission to the United Nations, and in effect functioned as Acting United
                        States Representative at the United Nations in the absence of Ambassador
                        Austin. Also representing the United States at the Deputy Representative
                        level were two Deputy United States Representatives on the Economic and
                        Social Council, Messrs. Leroy D. Stinebower and Walter M. Kotschnig; and the
                        Deputy United States Representative on the Trusteeship Council, Mr. Benjamin
                        Gerig.</p>
                    <p>United States military representatives on the Military Staff Committee of the
                        Security Council at this time included: Lt. Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway (Army),
                        Admiral W. K. Hewitt (Navy) and Lt. Gen. H. R. Harmon (Air Force).</p>

                            the General Assembly which would function between the regular sessions
                            of the General Assembly. It held a broad commission to make studies on

                            field and in the maintenance of international peace and security were to
                            be implemented; and, within the scope of its jurisdiction, to conduct
                            investigations and to appoint commissions of inquiry. More precisely,
                            the Interim Committee was to assist the General Assembly in matters
                            specifically referred to it by the General Assembly, and at the
                            beginning of 1948 it had a specific instruction from the Assembly to

                        <p>The amendments provide for the establishment of a new position, namely,
                            that of Deputy Representative of the United States to the United
                            Nations, to be appointed by the President, by and with the <pb n="5"
                                xml:id="pg_5" facs="0025"/>advice and consent of the Senate. It is
                            also provided that the Representative and Deputy Representative of the
                            United States to the United Nations shall have the rank and status of
                            ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary and shall receive
                            compensation at the same rates as are paid to chiefs of missions, class
                            I and class II, respectively, under the Foreign Service Act. The
                            Representative and Deputy Representative are designated as the principal
                            representatives in the Security Council of the United Nations and are
                            authorized to serve ex officio as United States representative on any
                            organ, commission, or body of the United Nations. This section changes
                            the title of the United States Representative at the seat of the United
                            Nations to Representative of the United States to the United Nations.
                            This minor change in title brings the title into accord with the title
                            used on the appointment and confirmation of Ambassador Austin to his
                            present position.</p>

                        <p>The section is amended to authorize the appointment of an additional
                            Deputy Representative of the United States in the Security Council and
                            to provide that he shall serve in the Security Council in the event of
                            the absence or disability of the Representative and Deputy
                            Representative of the United States to the United Nations. The amendment
                            eliminates the provision for rank of envoy extraordinary and minister
                            plenipotentiary for this position. The effect of this amendment is to
                            provide a third member of the United States Mission authorized to serve
                            on the Security Council. This Deputy Representative, however, would not
                            be authorized to serve on any other organ of the United Nations.</p>

                        <p>The amendments to this section change the authorization of the President
                            to designate an officer of the United States to serve, without the
                            advice and consent of the Senate, in the Economic and Social Council and
                            the Trusteeship Council to cover any specified session of either Council
                            rather than any specified meeting as currently provided in the act. The
                            amendments also permit the designation by the President, without the
                            advice and consent of the Senate, of any officer of the United States to
                            act in either of these Councils for a specified session thereof in the
                            event that the position is vacant as well as in the absence or
                            disability of the regular representative.</p>
                        <p>An additional amendment to this section would authorize the President to
                            designate any departmental officer of the Department of State, whose
                            appointment is subject to confirmation by the Senate, to serve for
                            temporary periods as the Representative of the United States in the
                            Security Council of the United Nations in the absence or disability <pb
                                n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0026"/>of the Representative and Deputy
                            Representative or in lieu of such Representatives in connection with a
                            specified subject matter.</p>
                        <p>It is proposed to amend the section also to make it unnecessary to secure
                            Senate confirmation of Presidential appointments to the Commissions of
                            the United Nations to which the United States is entitled to appoint a
                            representative, except for such commissions as may be formed by the
                            United Nations with respect to atomic energy. This amendment would make
                            it unnecessary to secure Senate confirmation of Presidential
                            appointments to the many commissions of the Economic and Social Council
                            or to subcommissions of any other organ of the United Nations.</p>

                        <p>Section 7 authorizes the Secretary of State to acquire by purchase, gift,
                            devise, construction, exchange, lease or rental, an official residence
                            for the use of the Representative of the United States to the United
                            Nations and the use of the appropriation for participation in the United
                            Nations for payment of maintenance and operating costs of the residence.
                            This amendment is drafted to make provisions for a residence for the
                            Representative, similar to provisions of this nature in the Foreign
                            Service Act of 1946.</p>

                        <p>Most of the amendments of this section are designed to clarify provisions
                            of the existing law and to bring it more nearly into accord with related
                            legislation. The amendments to this section specifically exempt the
                            United States Mission from the provisions of the civil-service laws and
                            the Classification Act of 1923, as amended. The amendments also exempt
                            the mission from the provisions of the Subsistence Expense Act of 1926
                            with regard to the rates of per diem allowances in lieu of subsistence
                            expenses. It is proposed to amend the provision regarding payment of
                            cost of living allowances to limit such payment to personnel stationed
                            abroad but to broaden the allowances for official entertainment to
                            include representation also. This provision will permit payment of
                            allowances for living quarters and cost of living allowances to any
                            representatives who may be appointed to regional commissions of the
                            United Nations where the headquarters are located outside of the United
                            States, such as the Economic Commission for Europe. It also brings the
                            provision for payment of entertainment and representation allowances in
                            line with provisions of the Foreign Service Act. It is proposed also to
                            amend this section to exempt the use of the appropriation for printing
                            and binding from provisions of section 11 of the act of March 1, 1919
                            (44 U.S.C. 111) (note statute requiring printing by the Government
                            Printing Office) and to exempt the use of the appropriation for expenses
                            as authorized in section 7 and other expenses authorized by the
                            Secretary of State from this <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0027"

                    <p>313. Eyes alone for Ambassador Austin from Rusk. Dept. is very much concerned
                        about possibilities of further delay in Participation Act amendment because
                        of House Foreign Affairs Committee desire to lump together several bills in
                        omnibus legislation.<note n="1" xml:id="d5fn1">The Senate had passed a bill
                            amending the United Nations Participation Act on April 26 (<gloss

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Austin</hi>: I have been giving considerable
                        thought to the specific tasks which each member of our General Assembly
                        Delegation should undertake in order to produce the most effective over-all
                        result. The development of the general international situation will
                        determine how long I shall be able to remain with the Delegation. I am
                        particularly anxious not to leave the impression at the beginning of the
                        Assembly that I shall remain for only a short time. Nevertheless, our
                        planning must be on the basis that I might have to leave the Delegation.
                        With that in mind, I am asking you to serve as Deputy Chairman of the
                        Delegation and assume the Chairmanship if it becomes necessary for me to
                            leave.<note n="1" xml:id="d10fn1">The Secretary of State was with the
                            U.S. Delegation to the General Assembly at Paris from the opening of the
                            session on September 21 until November 21 when he returned to Washington
                            at the request of President Truman, except for short absences on two
                            successive week-ends in October on the occasion of a consultation with
                            the President in Washington (October 9–11; see Department of State <hi
                                rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, October 17, 1948, p. 483) and a visit
                            to Athens (October 16–18; see <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., October 31,
                            1948, p. 561). Special serial designations were established for handling
                            cable traffic pertaining to Secretary Marshall personally while he was
                            at Paris: “Telmar” for Washington cables and “<gloss target="#t_Martel1"
                                >Martel</gloss>” for cables from Paris. Occasionally matters
                            pertaining to the U.S. Delegation spilled over into this series.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>As for other tasks during the Assembly, the present state of the Indonesian,
                        Palestine, Kashmir and other questions suggests that the Security Council
                        will play a more active role than during last year’s Assembly. That factor
                        necessarily influences your availability for detailed work in the Assembly.
                        However, you are assigned responsibility for the General Committee, for the
                        Report of the Security Council, and for atomic energy, regulation of
                        armaments and Article 43 forces. In connection with the last three items,
                        our intelligence estimates lead us to believe that the Soviet Delegation
                        will stage a major propaganda offensive in this field. The demand on you
                        will be a very heavy one, but your previous experience and personal interest
                        in these subjects are such that I believe you should carry this important
                        part of our debate.</p>
                    <p>If a serious move develops in the General Assembly to move the headquarters
                        of the United Nations away from New York, it may be necessary for you to
                        intervene on that subject in Committee 5. We hope that this will not become
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>Our experience in the General Assembly last year convinces me that the
                        Delegates and Alternate Delegates themselves should accept even more
                        responsibility for establishing direct contacts with the senior
                        representatives in other delegations. There will be political liaison <pb

                        Delegation but these officers can only supplement and not substitute for the
                        direct relationships established by our Delegates. Ambassador Ray Atherton
                        is being asked to pay particular attention to this aspect of our work and
                        will be available to assist you in any way you desire.</p>
                    <p>I shall wish to discuss with you my opening statement to the General Assembly
                        immediately upon our arrival in Paris. Its general tone will be affected
                        considerably by the course of the discussions on Berlin and will therefore
                        have to be reviewed very carefully immediately prior to delivery.<note n="2"

                        the Honorable John Foster Dulles will act as Chairman of the Delegation; the

                    <p>The Honorable Warren R. Austin has left the Delegation because of

                            because of the curious loop-hole in the 1945 law which made no provision
                            for a Deputy U.S. Representative at the United Nations (see again the
                            letter from the Secretary of State to the Speaker of the House of
                            Representatives, March 17, 1948, which asked for amending legislation to

                                Delegation to the General Assembly, he was not named acting U.S.
                                representative in respect of the Security Council nor acting chief
                                of the U.S. Mission at the United Nations; normally in the absence
                                of the Secretary of State all three positions were held by the same
                                man, the U.S. Representative at the United Nations. In this case
                                Professor Jessup was appointed in an acting capacity for both the
                                Security Council and the Mission, and he was in effect Acting U.S.
                                Representative at the United Nations. Professor Jessup was appointed
                                to the personal rank of ambassador by President Truman on December

                        has just entered hospital with bronchitis and some temperature. While his
                        condition is not serious at this stage, he is generally exhausted and we

                        member of delegation should handle in plenary if possible. Of Dulles, Cohen
                        and Roosevelt, Dulles is the only chief delegate we should consider. I
                        believe he would do it if I urged him to, but he needs some assurance that
                        his doing so is agreeable to White House.</p>
                    <p>It would be unfortunate if any partisan element entered Palestine question at
                        this stage since resolution before plenary raises no such issues. If White
                        House or Department believes matter should be handled by permanent officer,
                        I would do so. Canada, Australia, New Zealand and China will jointly sponsor
                        certain minor amendments discussed in separate telegram on basis of which it
                        now appears Arabs will abstain and Arab friends will support resolution,
                        thereby removing much of present uncertainty re fate of Palestine
                        resolution. Question is therefore not one of difficulty in handling but
                        whether you agree with me that most senior available delegate should
                        represent US on this sensitive subject. Please comment <gloss

                    <p>Second problem is possibility that Jessup may not be available for <gloss

                        morning to consider Israel membership. Since Palestine resolution is not
                        expected to come up in plenary before Friday and since we do not wish <gloss
                            target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> to consider membership before completion
                            <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> action, we shall endeavor to postpone
                        this meeting. However, another <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting is
                        tentatively scheduled for next Wednesday on Hyderabad. You should therefore
                        giver immediate attention to problem raised by absence legally qualified US
                        Representative on <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> under Participation Act.
                        There seems little doubt to me but that President has constitutional powers
                        fully adequate to make an emergency appointment to ensure that US is
                        represented on <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> in situation where normally
                        qualified representatives are physically unable to attend. Suggest quick
                        legal check by State and Department Justice on this point. Problem is
                        internal to us since <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would accept
                        credentials from Secretary of State regardless of domestic American law. One
                        possibility would be for President to call upon one of State Department
                        officers in Paris already confirmed by Senate for present post (Thorp,
                        Gross, Bohlen). This would conform to provisions of amended Participation
                        Act as passed by Senate though not yet passed by House, and should be easily
                        cleared with Connally and Vandenberg as best way meeting emergency this
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>Suggest no formal action be taken to provide credentials for another US

                        <p>Apart from President’s power to make appointment under constitutional
                            power over foreign relations, Participation Act 1945, Section 2(d) when
                            read literally clearly authorizes President to make such emergency
                            appointment. Section 2(d) reads ‘The President may also appoint from
                            time to time such other persons as he may deem necessary to represent
                            the United States in the organs and agencies of the United Nations.’
                            Dept. of Justice approves this interpretation. Limitations ‘(A)’ and

                            Acting Secretary of State (Lovett) conveyed to Mr. Dulles the

                            “tomorrow” (501.BB/12–848); actually the Palestine discussion was not
                            resumed until December 11 and no one spoke for the United States at that
                            time. In the meantime on December 10 President Truman had appointed Mr.

                            (Instruction 22, December 10, 501.BB/12–1048); the letter of appointment
                            arrived in Paris however only hours before Mr. Dulles was leaving for
                            the United States and “could not be delivered” (Despatch P–1355,

                            Nations and in increasing its effectiveness is an impressive fact. A
                            vast amount of thought is being devoted throughout our country to means

                            circumstances. The attitude of the United States towards the problems of
                            the United Nations will have a profound effect on the future of the

                        <p>A clear understanding of the international situation is essential to
                            decisions on the course we should pursue. Neither the United Nations nor
                            any other form of world organization can exist as an abstraction without
                            relation to the realities of a given world situation.</p>
                        <p>The United Nations was conceived on the assumption that certain
                            conditions would develop following the war. These were: (1) that the
                            major powers charged with responsibility for working out peace
                            settlements would complete their task promptly and effectively; (2) that
                            the critical postwar conditions in the economic and political fields
                            would be brought to an end as speedily as possible; and (3) that the
                            cooperation among the great powers pledged during the war and reflected
                            in the Charter would be continuing.</p>
                        <p>The United Nations was specifically designed to preserve the peace and
                            not to make the peace. The task of making the peace settlements was
                            specifically recognized by article 107 of the Charter as one for the
                            responsible victor powers. The United Nations can assist in this task,
                            but the improvement of the United Nations machinery would not in itself
                            solve the problem. Since the most important of the peace settlements
                            have not been agreed upon, the United Nations has been compelled to
                            carry on its activities under world conditions far different from those
                            contemplated by the Charter.</p>
                        <p>It was obvious to the framers of the Charter of the United Nations that
                            an effective organization to preserve the peace must include every <pb
                                n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0043"/>major power. The San Francisco
                            conference created an organization, the purposes and principles of which
                            corresponded with the objectives of the United States foreign policy.
                            The organization as developed at San Francisco received the overwhelming
                            endorsement of the American people and had the virtually unanimous
                            approval of the United States Senate.</p>
                        <p>This organization was designed to consolidate and strengthen over a long
                            period of time the foundations of peace through common action in solving
                            political, economic, social, cultural, and health problems. Machinery
                            was established for the settlement of international disputes by peaceful
                            means so that the advice and assistance of all members, and the
                            mobilization of world public opinion, might be brought to bear in the
                            pacific settlement of disputes. It was found possible to go considerably
                            farther than the League of Nations in the establishment of enforcement
                            machinery, but at the San Francisco conference none of the major powers
                            was prepared to grant to this organization the right of enforcement
                            against a major power.</p>
                        <p>When universal agreement to the Charter was achieved, the strength of the
                            major powers in relation to one another was such that no one of them
                            could safely break the peace if the others stood united in defense of
                            the Charter. Under existing world circumstances the maintenance of a
                            comparable power relationship is fundamental to world security.</p>
                        <p>The aspirations of the people of the world as set forth in the Charter of
                            the United Nations have been shaken by developments since the summer of
                            1945. It gradually became apparent that the postwar conditions
                            anticipated at San Francisco were not being realized. The failure of
                            concerted action by the major Allies rendered it necessary for the
                            United States Government to attempt to create the desired postwar
                            conditions in cooperation with other states willing to do so.</p>
                        <p>It became progressively clearer that serious misconceptions prevailed in
                            the minds of the leaders of the Soviet Union concerning western
                            civilization and the possibilities for developing stabilized working
                            relations between the Soviet Union and the other members of the
                            community of nations. It is a misconception to suppose that domination
                            of the world by a single system is inevitable. It is a misconception to
                            suppose that differing systems cannot live side by side in peace under
                            the basic rules of international conduct prescribed by the Charter of
                            the United Nations. These rules are obligatory upon all members.</p>
                        <p>A fundamental task of the United Nations and of our foreign policy is to
                            dispel the misconceptions of the Soviet leaders and to bring about a
                            more realistic view of what is possible and what is impossible in the
                            relationship between the Soviet Union and the world at large. In <pb
                                n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0044"/>this way there can be restored to
                            international society the equilibrium necessary to permit the United
                            Nations to function as contemplated at San Francisco.</p>
                        <p>Our realization of the need for this equilibrium has led to action along
                            several lines, all designed to create conditions favorable to the
                            working of the United Nations. The first necessary step was to insure
                            the freedom and independence of the members. The ability of democratic
                            peoples to preserve their independence in the face of totalitarian
                            threats depends upon their determination to do so. That determination in
                            turn depends upon the development of a healthy economic and political
                            life and a genuine sense of security.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, the United States Government is responding to requests to
                            provide economic assistance to various countries in Europe and
                            elsewhere. The United States is cooperating with 16 European countries
                            in a recovery program providing for self-help and mutual aid.<note n="5"

                            to restore the balance of power relationships required for international

                                political policy in Europe: specifically it involved proposals for
                                the adoption of universal military training and the re-enactment of
                                selective service legislation. This policy to take up a more

                            individual and collective self-defense. Certain countries of western
                            Europe likewise have organized themselves into a Western Union, for

                        <p>The United Nations is the forum of daily world negotiation. It is the
                            world’s vehicle for dealing with basic economic and social
                            maladjustments, for developing safeguards of essential freedoms, for
                            advancing the development of dependent peoples and areas.</p>
                        <p>On several occasions negotiation in the United Nations, even during its
                            short history, has postponed fighting long enough to remove the cause
                            for fighting. It is a forum of negotiation where charges or distortions
                            are held answerable, where violations of treaty obligations must meet
                            the verdict of world opinion, and where those responsible must answer
                            for their conduct. It is a forum where the nations of the world are
                            called upon to uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter. United
                            Nations negotiation affords continuing working contacts in international
                            relations and an open door to communication between the East and the
                            West.</p>
                        <p>A number of projects designed to improve international conditions by new
                            forms of international organization have been proposed. These projects
                            envisage radical changes in the existing United Nations Charter. Some
                            propose the elimination of a veto on enforcement <pb n="27"
                                xml:id="pg_27" facs="0047"/>measures, the establishment of
                            inequality of voting among the major powers, and the virtual elimination
                            of the influence of small nations in Security Council decisions. Others
                            go beyond the revision of the United Nations Charter and call for the
                            establishment of new forms of international structure along the lines of
                            world government. In general, the proponents of these projects recognize
                            the probability that the proposals would not be accepted by at least one
                            of the major powers and by a number of other governments now members of
                            the United Nations. They advocate that in this case the respective
                            projects be put into effect among such nations as would accept them.</p>
                        <p>All of these projects appear to rest on the assumption that the present
                            unsatisfactory state of world affairs is a result of inability on the
                            part of the United Nations to prevent aggression; that this inability
                            arises from the exercise of the veto power in the Security Council and
                            the lack of a United Nations police force; that if the veto power on
                            enforcement decisions could be removed and the United Nations provided
                            with armed forces, aggression could be prevented; and that the principal
                            barrier to world peace would thereby cease to exist.</p>
                        <p>The general assumption rests I think on an incomplete analysis of our
                            main problems of foreign policy at this juncture and of the part which
                            international organization can play in solving them.</p>
                        <p>The underlying problem in the immediate future is to bring about the
                            restoration of economic, social, and political health in the world and
                            to give to the peoples of the world a sense of security which is
                            essential for them to carry on the task of recovery. What is needed for
                            the achievement of a world order based on law and dedicated to peace and
                            progress is a widespread improvement in the material and social
                            well-being of the peoples of the world. The responsibility for such
                            improvement will always rest primarily upon the peoples and governments
                            themselves. In this field the United Nations, however, can play an
                            increasingly active role.</p>
                        <p>The factor of military strength is of immediate and major importance in
                            the present world situation, but is not the element which will be
                            paramount in the long run. The emphasis often placed solely on the
                            military aspects of world affairs does a disservice to the cause of
                            peace. The more that present differences are talked about and treated
                            exclusively as a military problem, the more they tend to become so.</p>
                        <p>The problems today presented to those who desire peace are not questions
                            of structure. Nor are they problems solvable merely by new forms of
                            organization. They require performance of obligations already
                            undertaken, fidelity to pledges already given. Basic human frailties
                            cannot be overcome by Charter provisions alone, for they exist in the
                            behavior of men and governments.</p>

                        <p>The suggestion that a revised United Nations, or some form of world
                            government, should be achieved, if necessary, without those nations
                            which would be unwilling to join, deserves special attention. Such a
                            procedure would probably destroy the present United Nations
                            organization. The result would be a dispersal of the community of
                            nations, followed by the formation of rival military alliances and
                            isolated groups of states. This result would weaken us and expose us to
                            even greater dangers from those who seek domination of other states.</p>

                        <p>The United Nations was created after years of study and after many months
                            of difficult negotiations. It now has 58 members. It is the symbol of
                            the aspirations of mankind. Its success is the hope of mankind. All new
                            efforts to attain order and organization in the affairs of men require
                            time to grow roots in the loyalties of men. The history of our own
                            people testifies to this necessity. Let us not in our impatience and our
                            fears sacrifice the hard-won gains that we now possess in the United

                                (Tab C), apparently envisages a force of from 1,000 to 5,000 men
                                (1,200 has been specifically mentioned), to be recruited largely, if
                                not entirely, from the smaller countries. The force would be under

                                other organs. It would be given light weapons and mobile equipment
                                and would be based near <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                Headquarters. It would be financed from a special budget and would
                                cost approximately six million dollars if kept in the United States
                                for training, or eight million dollars if foreign travel of a

                                    would increase the effectiveness of those missions. Such a
                                    detachment would be able to furnish a considerable degree of
                                    real protection to the property, personnel and employees of the
                                    mission and to persons with whom the mission was called upon to
                                    deal. It could perform other services for the mission which
                                    would greatly facilitate the latter’s operations, including
                                    assistance on the problem of communication facilities. The
                                    presence of a small guard could be expected to have an important
                                    psychological effect on the members of the mission, and on the
                                    persons with whom the mission was called upon to deal. In most

                                    the preservation of peace. It is believed that the symbolic
                                    effect of such guards would be out of all proportion to the
                                    actual capabilities of the detachment.</item>

                        <p>After the General Assembly commenced the second part of the third session
                            on April 5, 1949, the <hi rend="italic">Ad Hoc</hi> Committee took up
                            security guard proposal in three meetings; and on April 11, 1949
                            submitted a report with an accompanying draft resolution to the General
                            Assembly (United Nations document A/835); for text of the report, see

                            pages 46–48. The draft resolution provided for the establishment of a
                            special committee of fourteen members, including the five permanent
                            members of the Security Council. The special committee was to study the
                            proposal for a United Nations guard “… in all its relevant aspects,
                            including the technical, budgetary and legal problems involved, and such
                            other proposals as [might] be made by Member States and by the

                            effectiveness of the services provided to the United Nations missions by

                        <p>The General Assembly took up the report of the <hi rend="italic">Ad

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Gross</hi>: In reference to your letter
                            of 3 December 1947 regarding the meaning of Article VII of the General
                            Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, I wish to
                            thank you for the interest you have expressed in this matter. Your
                            letter is particularly pertinent at this time since the Report of the
                            Sixth Committee, approved by the General Assembly, at its recent session
                            dealt specifically with this question. Section 14 of the Report
                            (Document A/427) which I enclose,<note n="1" xml:id="d21fn1">Marginal
                                notation: “No enclosure when read in Le”.</note> indicates the hope
                            of the Committee “that future negotiations between the Secretary-General
                            and the appropriate authorities of the United States might lead to a
                            modification of the views of the United States Government as hitherto
                            expressed to the Secretary-General with the result that the provisions
                            of Article VII should produce the full effects that they were designed
                            to secure”.</p>
                        <p>Before answering the questions contained in your letter of 3 December
                            1947, it seems necessary to clarify the position of the United Nations
                            concerning the <hi rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi>, and its scope. In
                            this connection, I would like to refer to your letter of 11 September
                            1947 to Dr. Ivan Kerno regarding the <hi rend="italic"
                                >laissez-passer</hi>. You mention the fact that in one stage of the
                            drafting of the General Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the
                            United Nations, the word “passport” was used in Article VII, but in the
                            final draft, the word “<hi rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi>” is used.
                            Originally, in the Preparatory Commission and in the Sixth Committee at
                            the first Session of the General Assembly, the word “passport” was used,
                            and Article VII provided that the organization might issue a United
                            Nations passport to its officials, all such United Nations passports to
                            be recognized and accepted as passports by the authorities of members.
                            However, in a sub-committee of the Sixth Committee, at the instigation
                            of the Representative of Poland, a drafting change was made in this
                            section, supplementing for the word “passport” the words “<hi
                                rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi>” and “valid travel document”.
                            There was no indication at that time that such a change was meant to
                            alter the original intention <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0056"/>of
                            Article VII to have a valid travel document serving as a United Nations
                            passport, or to make such a travel document merely a certificate
                            attesting to the United Nations affiliation of the bearer in respect to
                            travel, as was suggested in the Report of the Foreign Relations
                            Committee of the United States Senate. In fact, the majority of the
                            Committee seemed to feel that such a travel document, serving as a
                            passport was necessary, under the terms of Articles 104 and 105 of the

                            Nations so that in each case where it was necessary for such an official
                            to travel, it would not be necessary for his government to be consulted.
                            To make the matter even clearer, Section 25 of the General Convention
                            provides for the additional issuance of a certificate when such an
                            official is travelling on United Nations official business.<note n="2"

                        </p>
                        <p>I understand from your present letter and previous conversations with the
                            United States Delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, that
                            your Government is concerned with the situation that might arise insofar
                            as United Nations officials are concerned, if such officials become
                            resident in the United States and are then not returnable to another
                            country at the time when they are terminated from the United Nations. We
                            can fully appreciate your point of view; however, it is felt that this
                            problem does not arise from the <hi rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi> or
                            its use. Officials of the United Nations who are in the United States on
                            a valid national passport or are resident aliens before their
                            appointment to the United Nations do not change their status as far as
                            the United States is concerned; nor does it affect their returnability
                            to the country of origin, merely because they may have been given a <hi
                                rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi> to depart from and re-enter the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>In answer to the first question in your letter of 3 December 1947, the
                                <hi rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi> is to be used by officials of
                            the United Nations to facilitate the travel of such persons while on
                            temporary missions abroad, to insure that such missions may be made
                            rapidly and independently of national governments.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d21fn3">Marginal notation: “No. Right to require visas
                                recognized by Sec. 25 of Convention.”</note> It is however the
                            intention of the United Nations to allow its personnel to travel on <hi
                                rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi> for short leaves. In reference to
                            the suggestions made in paragraphs 1 and 2 of your letter, I would like
                            to point out that if the United Nations were to adopt the procedures
                            suggested in these paragraphs, it would mean <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37"
                                facs="0057"/>that in each instance where it was necessary for a
                            United Nations official to travel abroad for the United Nations, the
                            country of which he was a national would have to be consulted in order
                            that permission for such travel might be granted. After that it might
                            still be necessary to consult the Government of a second country. It is
                            obvious that in such cases officials of the organization would not have
                            all the facilities required for the independent exercise of their
                            functions as defined in Article 105 of the Charter. Furthermore, it is
                            to be assumed that an individual will usually be returnable to the
                            country of which he has held a valid national passport.<note n="4"

                            the use of the <hi rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi> seems to exist
                            primarily as far as the persons not holding a valid national passport at
                            the time of their appointment to the United Nations are concerned.</p>
                        <p>In conjunction with your letter, and in order to further the wish of the
                            General Assembly that further negotiations be carried out with the
                            United States Government to clarify this matter, we wish to suggest the
                            following procedure in the hope that it may be acceptable to your
                            Government and remove its doubt as far as the <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>I would very much appreciate your views on this matter since it seems
                            highly desirable for some solution to be arrived at as soon as possible.
                            If it appears necessary to carry on further discussions in order to
                            arrive at such a solution, we would be glad to send a member of the
                            staff to Washington to discuss this matter.</p>

                                    it cares to make on such applications. After due consideration

                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Feller’s letter, which you handed to me some time ago for comment,
                            raises rather difficult problems, which involve the status of the United
                            Nations and its relationship to this Government. I have studied the
                            problem with considerable care and have discussed it with several
                            persons. In this connection I have endeavored to ascertain whether it is
                            proposed that the <hi rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi> should be issued
                            in any cases to aliens who have not yet come to this country, and if so
                            how. I had some difficulty in ascertaining what agencies the United
                            Nations organization has in foreign countries, by which the <hi
                                rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi> might be issued. With regard to
                            this I was referred to Dr. Saba,<note n="1" xml:id="d23fn1">Dr. Hanna
                                Saba, Director of the Division of Privileges and Immunities and
                                Registration of Treaties, in the Legal Department of the Secretariat
                                of the United Nations.</note> and I understand from his statement
                            that at the present time there is no branch office of the United Nations
                            except in Geneva. I was also told them formerly was a branch office in
                            London but it has been closed. Presumably the <hi rend="italic"
                                >laissez-passer</hi> will be issued as a rule by the organization in
                            New York, but perhaps these documents may occasionally be issued by the
                            office in Geneva.</p>
                        <p>Before discussing the points mentioned by Mr. Feller, especially with
                            regard to paragraphs 1–4 on page 4 of his letter, it seems desirable to
                            consider the nature of a passport and its relationship to the United
                            Nations <hi rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The term “passport” is defined by John Bassett Moore as follows:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“A passport is the accepted international evidence of nationality. In
                                its usual form, it certifies that the person described in it is a
                                citizen <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0062"/>or subject of the
                                country by whose authority it is issued, and requests for him
                                permission to come and go, as well as lawful aid and protection.”

                        </quote>
                        <p>With regard to the nature and function of passports Moore quotes from a
                            note of May 19, 1886 from Secretary Bayard to the Spanish Minister, in
                            which the following passage appears:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Passports are <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> evidence of the
                                individual’s right as a citizen to the protection of the Government
                                which issues them, and a special responsibility rests upon the
                                Government that disregards such evidence.” (III Moore, <hi

                        <p>I have been endeavoring (so far without success) to obtain a sample copy

                        <p>I am informed that a <hi rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi> contains
                            spaces for the name and personal description of the bearer and his
                            photograph. I am informed that it contains no space for a statement of
                            the bearer’s nationality.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that the <hi rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi> is not a
                            passport, and that it does not call for the protection of the bearer by
                            any government, and of course the United Nations itself cannot extend
                            diplomatic protection (at least directly) to its officers or employees.
                            As indicated in Article VII of the Convention on the Privileges and
                            Immunities of the United Nations, the <hi rend="italic"
                                >laissez-passer</hi> is a travel document designed to show the
                            position of the bearer as an official of the United Nations and to
                            expedite his travel. While members of the United Nations are undoubtedly
                            under an obligation to give due respect to the <hi rend="italic"
                                >laissez-passer</hi>, in accordance with the intent of Article VII
                            of the Convention, they are not required to recognize it as taking the
                            place of a national passport.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that Section 25 of the Convention recognizes the right
                            of states to require visas of holders of United Nations <hi
                                rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi>, although it does not state that
                            the visas are to be placed on the <hi rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi>
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>The right to require visas of holders of <hi rend="italic"
                                >laissez-passer</hi> is also recognized by Section 13 of the United
                            Nations Headquarters Agreement, which is embodied in the Joint
                            Resolution of Congress of August 4, 1947 (Public Law 357–80th Congress).
                            Section 13 provides that, when visas are required of persons referred to
                            in Section 11, they shall be granted without charge and as promptly as
                            possible. What is more important, it provides that the “Laws and
                            regulations in force in the United States regarding the entry of aliens
                            shall not be applied in such manner as to interfere with the privileges
                            referred to in Section 11.” Section 13 contains a similar provision
                            concerning the laws of the United States governing residence of aliens
                            and their deportation, requiring the approval of the Secretary of State
                            for the latter.</p>
                        <p>As Section 11 of the Headquarters Agreement is of special importance, it
                            will be quoted in full:</p>

                            in effect.</p>
                        <p>In my conversation of yesterday with Dr. Saba of the United Nations, he
                            mentioned the provision of <gloss target="#t_SJRes1">S.J. Res.</gloss>
                            136, quoted above. I understood him to say that he was not inclined to
                            favor the reservation in question. He made a statement to the effect
                            that, if a passport should be required of a person representing the
                            United Nations or having business with that organization in pursuance of
                            Section 11 of the Headquarters Agreement, quoted above, the person’s
                            mission “would have to be agreeable to his own government”, whereas the
                            United Nations wishes “to make the operations of the United Nations <pb
                                n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0065"/>independent of control by any
                            government.” However, I did not consider that I was called upon to
                            discuss this question with Dr. Saba.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to Mr. Feller’s letter, and with reference particularly to
                            paragraphs 1–4 on page 4, I may say that I see no objection to the
                            proposed procedure for keeping a “photostatic copy of each national
                            passport upon which the <hi rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi> was
                            issued”, but to my mind it is questionable whether that would be
                            sufficient to satisfy the needs of this Government. It might be
                            sufficient during the period of validity of the passport, but I am
                            inclined to think that the bearer of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >laisser-passer</hi> should always, when entering the United States,
                            be provided with a passport which is still valid, since this would
                            facilitate his deportation to the country of his nationality in case he
                            should violate the conditions upon which he is admitted to the United
                            States or should make himself objectionable, as, for example, by
                            carrying on political propaganda in this country.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, it may be remarked that paragraph 1 refers to “<hi
                                rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi> … issued at the seat of the United
                            Nations or in the regional United Nations offices”, although, as
                            indicated above, there appears to be only one United Nations office
                            outside of the United States, that is, the office in Geneva.</p>
                        <p>Cases may arise in which the bearer of a <hi rend="italic"
                                >laissez-passer</hi> is unable to obtain a passport of the foreign
                            state of which he is a national because he is not in favor with the
                            government thereof or cannot because of his political views or
                            connections. Cases may also arise in which the bearers of the <hi
                                rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi> are nationals of countries the
                            governments of which are not recognized by the United States. In these
                            cases it would seem that the proper course would be to require the alien
                            in question to have the consular visa on a duplicate copy of the
                            application. Such procedure has been in effect for years with regard to
                            aliens of the classes mentioned visiting the United States temporarily
                            for business or pleasure.</p>
                        <p>As to paragraph 2, it would seem that, if the aliens in question have
                            been admitted to the United States for permanent residence, they should
                            provide themselves with re-entry permits. Such documents may be obtained
                            directly from the immigration staff at Ellis Island.</p>
                        <p>As to any aliens coming within the purview of paragraph 2 who have not
                            been admitted to the United States for permanent residence, it is
                            believed that they should be provided with passports of their
                            governments or duplicate copies of visa applications, as indicated
                            above, for use in reentering the United States. If the aliens in
                            question are German nationals or Japanese persons of any foreign
                            nationality, or if the aliens are departing from this country with the
                            intention of entering Germany, Austria, Japan or Korea, it is understood
                            that, <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0066"/>under the existing
                            regulations, they should provide themselves with exit permits. Whether
                            this requirement should be waived in behalf of those who are bearers of
                                <hi rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi> would seem to be a question of
                            policy, for consideration by the Visa Division and other offices in the
                            Department having to do with policy.</p>
                        <p>As to paragraph 3, the discussion above concerning paragraph 1 is
                            believed to be pertinent. As indicated therein, it is believed that the
                            aliens in question should provide themselves with duplicate visa
                            applications, with consular visas affixed thereto.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph 4 relates to the documentation of citizens of the United
                            States, and it is believed that such persons should be provided with
                            passports of this Government when they travel abroad, since they may
                            find it necessary to call upon this Government for diplomatic protection
                            in foreign countries. The <hi rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi>, as
                            indicated above, is not a passport and does not in itself call for the
                            protection of this Government to the bearer. Therefore, the issuance of
                            such a document to a citizen of the United States would not seem to
                            contravene the provisions of 22 U.S.C., sec. 211(<hi rend="italic"
                                >a</hi>), which read as follows:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The Secretary of State may grant and issue passports, and cause
                                passports to be granted, issued, and verified in foreign countries
                                by diplomatic representatives of the United States, and by such
                                consul generals, consuls, or vice consuls when in charge, as the
                                Secretary of State may designate, and by the chief or other

                                under such rules as the President shall designate and prescribe for
                                and on behalf of the United States, and no other person shall grant,
                                issue, or verify such passports.”</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>For the reasons indicated, Mr. Feller’s suggestion concerning the use of
                            the <hi rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi> as a passport can hardly be
                            followed. However, there is no apparent reason why the bearer of a <hi
                                rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi> who is a citizen of the United
                            States should not also carry a passport of this Government. If such a
                            person should be sent abroad on a very urgent mission, it would seem
                            that he might obtain a passport of this Government directly from the
                            passport agency in New York City. I understand that under the existing
                            regulations ordinary passports may be obtained directly from the
                            passport agency, without the necessity of first sending the written
                            applications to the Department. It occurs to me that regulations might
                            be made under which special passports, showing the official status of
                            the bearers, might also be issued in New York in urgent cases. However,
                            I believe that this would require an amendment of the regulations, a
                            matter for consideration by the Passport Division. I may add that in the
                            preparation of the above statement I have considered not only your
                            memorandum of October 30, 1947, but also Mr. Knight’s memoranda of
                            October 7 and October 27, 1947.<note n="5" xml:id="d23fn5">Memoranda of

                        <p>The General Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United
                            Nations, adopted during the First Session of the General Assembly, has
                            not yet been acceded to by the United States of America. The procedure
                            authorizing the President of the United States to sign the pact of
                            accession passed through the Senate before its summer recess of 1947.
                            However, the House of Representatives had no time to do the same, and
                            the procedure is still pending before the House.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lie<note n="1" xml:id="d24fn1">Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of the
                                United Nations.</note> and Mr. Kerno would be very grateful if the
                            accession of the United States could be effected as soon as possible.
                            The Headquarters Agreement, signed on 26 June 1947 by Secretary of State
                            Marshall and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, is, indeed, in
                            some respect dependent on the General Convention. Moreover, the
                            accession of the United States will certainly precipitate the accession
                            of many other States.</p>
                        <p>As the activity of the United Nations is spreading over the whole world
                            as a consequence of the creation of different committees of the General
                            Assembly and the Security Council, it is evident that a fairly general
                            acceptance of the General Convention has become very necessary.</p>

                            in Central America. By analogy, therefore, Liu asks to be accredited at
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> headquarters as well as

                            only small nuclear group of professional permanent delegation members.
                            If those attending occasional sessions of councils were accredited on

                        <p>It is my understanding that a Joint Resolution authorizing the President
                            of the United States to accede to the above-mentioned Convention was
                            introduced in the last session of Congress, at the same time as
                            ratification of the Headquarters Agreement was considered. However, the
                            Convention on Privileges and Immunities was not acted upon in the House
                            of Representatives, and only the Headquarters Agreement which is
                            complementary to it was brought into effect.</p>

                            that final favorable consideration of such accession to the Convention
                            could be expected “when the present Congress reconvenes in January
                            1948”.</p>
                        <p>It has also been brought to my attention that at the time that the
                            Convention was before the Congress, certain reservations were
                            considered. The attention of the Department of State has already been
                            drawn to the fact that these reservations, if maintained, would have
                            very serious effects, particularly on the status of United Nations
                            officials and on the financial position of the Organization.</p>
                        <p>I am sure that all aspects of this matter are being given due
                            consideration, and I should appreciate any personal action that you
                            would consider appropriate to speed the accession of the United States
                            to the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United

                            12, 1948 from the United States Representative to the United Nations,
                            transmitting a copy of a note from the Secretary General of the United

                                was introduced in the 1947 session of Congress. This resolution was
                                approved by the Senate during that session of Congress and is now

                        <p>The Headquarters Agreement between the United States and the United
                            Nations, which came into force on November 21, 1947, presented novel
                            legal and administrative problems for the United States in providing for
                            the creation in New York of a Diplomatic Corps accredited to an
                            international organization rather than the host country.</p>
                        <p>As was the case with the League of Nations in Geneva, the Diplomatic
                            Corps at the United Nations is unusual in that there can be no provision
                            for reciprocal treatment for United States officials, which is the usual
                            basis in international comity on privileges and immunities.</p>
                        <p>The Chatter, in Article 105, provides that representatives of Members of
                            the United Nations should enjoy “such privileges and immunities as are
                            necessary for the independent exercise of their functions in connection
                            with the organization”.</p>
                        <p>In the discussions of this article in San Francisco, there was general
                            agreement that diplomatic privileges and immunities were anachronistic,
                            and that all that was necessary was to provide protection <pb n="51"
                                xml:id="pg_51" facs="0071"/>against interference with the official
                            duties of the representatives. It was clearly the intention that
                            diplomatic status should be conferred upon only a small group of
                            permanent Delegates, and that the nature of the privileges and
                            immunities should be narrowly restricted.</p>
                        <p>However, the permanent Delegations at Headquarters have been most anxious
                            that their privileges and immunities should not be less than those
                            ordinarily granted a Diplomatic Corps. The arrangements for diplomatic
                            privileges and immunities had to await the coming into force of the
                            Headquarters Agreement.</p>
                        <p>However, the United States had made provision for the limited and
                            essential type of immunity foreseen in the Charter with the passage of
                            Public Law 291, 79th Congress, on December 29, 1945. It provided that
                            representatives of foreign governments to international organizations
                            and members of their immediate families should enjoy the same
                            privileges, exemptions, and immunities as are accorded to officers and
                            employees of foreign governments in respect to regulations concerning
                            entry into and departure from the United States, alien registration and
                            fingerprinting, and the registration of foreign agents, and provided
                            that they shall be immune from suit and legal process relating to acts
                            performed by them in their official capacity except insofar as immunity
                            may be waived by the foreign government concerned.</p>
                        <p>The Headquarters Agreement, which is enacted as Public Law 857, 80th
                            Congress, provides (Section 15) that every person designated by a member
                            as the principal resident representative to the United Nations with the
                            rank of ambassador or minister plenipotentiary, and such resident
                            Members of their staffs as may be agreed upon between the
                            Secretary-General, the Government of the United States and the
                            Government of the Member concerned, shall, whether residing inside or
                            outside the Headquarters District, be entitled in the territory of the
                            United States to the same privileges and immunities, subject to
                            corresponding conditions and obligations, as are accorded to diplomatic
                            envoys accredited to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, the Department of State has, through the United States
                            Mission, negotiated with the Secretary-General and other Delegations to
                            establish a list of members of Delegations who are entitled to
                            diplomatic privileges and immunities.<note n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">There

                                Ambassador Austin communicated with the Department’s Chief of
                                Protocol, Stanley Woodward. There is a very sparse documentation on
                                this matter in the Department of State’s central indexed file
                                501.AC.</note> The criteria for inclusion on the list have been
                            established without a supplementary formal agreement. The Assembly, in
                            approving the Headquarters Agreement, had suggested to the United States
                            and the Secretary-General that Article <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52"

                            Immunities of the United Nations might be used as a guide in deciding
                            which members of the staffs should be included on the diplomatic list.
                            Article 16 of the General Convention defines “representatives” to
                            include all Delegates, Deputy Delegates, Advisers, Technical Experts,
                            and Secretaries of Delegations.</p>
                        <p>With the General Convention and the provision for equality of treatment
                            with the Diplomatic Corps in Washington as guides, the principle has
                            been accepted that there should be accredited in New York only members
                            of delegations with diplomatic rank or performing professional duties
                            who would be included on the diplomatic list if serving in Washington;

                                United States recognition of their diplomatic status under the
                                Headquarters Agreement. This letter of recognition was accorded to

                                diplomatic privileges and immunities and for whom the Mission had
                                received full information as respects functions, families, home

                        <p>Members of the immediate families of diplomatic personnel who are
                            regularly resident with them are also entitled to privileges and
                            immunities. Privileges and immunities are not extended to clerical or
                            administrative members of the delegations, nor to domestics, chauffeurs
                            or other members of the household staff. Such criteria result in a more
                            restricted arrangement than that in Washington. With families, our list
                            includes only 736 persons compared with the list of 1,550 in Washington.
                            The Washington list includes about 750 officers of Embassies and
                            Legations.</p>
                        <p>In requesting recognition, delegations submit names of their members whom
                            they believe entitled to privileges and immunities to the
                            Secretary-General who certifies their status to the Mission.</p>
                        <p>Members of delegations who are in New York temporarily, junior officers,
                            other alien employees and their families do, however, enjoy <pb n="53"

                        <p>The Headquarters Agreement provides that in the case of member
                            governments which are not recognized by the United States privileges and
                            immunities need be extended to their representatives and staffs only
                            within the Headquarters District, at their residences and offices, and
                            in transit between the district and such residences and offices, and in
                            transit on official business to or from foreign countries.</p>
                        <p>At present the Byelorussian and Ukranian Delegations, which have recently
                            been established in New York, are the only Delegations of Governments
                            not recognized by the United States. However, the United States has
                            extended to members of those two delegations privileges and immunities
                            identical with those given to other delegations. It has been pointed out
                            to the Secretary-General, however, that this act is a matter which may
                            be revised by the United States, and was taken without prejudice to the
                            right of the United States under the Headquarters Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Privileges and immunities in respect to federal laws and taxation were
                            quickly established by the Federal government through administrative
                            action. The legal authority for this already existed in the U.S. Code,
                            Title 22, Sections 251–255 so that it was only necessary by

                            binding upon states and municipalities. It provides that the Federal
                            Government will make the administrative arrangements with state and
                            local authorities. Accordingly, the United States Mission has negotiated
                            with New York State and local authorities. In all cases, it has been
                            found that no new legislation was needed and that on the basis of
                            opinions by the appropriate counsel that the question of privileges and
                            immunities could be handled administratively. The Attorney General of
                            the State of New York ruled on March 1, 1948, that New York should
                            accord privileges and immunities from arrest and conviction for crimes
                            and traffic infractions to members of delegations listed by the
                            Department of State as entitled to diplomatic privileges and immunities
                            under Public Law 357–80th Congress. The New York State Department of
                            Taxation rendered a similar opinion in respect to taxation on February
                            10, 1948. The State of New Jersey Department of Taxation and Finance
                            found similarly in respect to New <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0074"
                            />Jersey State taxes on March 17, 1948. The Corporation Counsel of New
                            York City made a similar ruling regarding city taxes as reported in a
                            letter from the Deputy Mayor on March 22, 1948.</p>
                        <p>Members of delegations enjoying privileges and immunities are immune from
                            all legal process, including traffic violations. In the event that they
                            become involved in such process, the Head or Chargé d’Affaires of the
                            delegation notifies the Mission. The Mission thereupon notifies the
                            appropriate judicial authority of the status of the delegation member
                            and arranges that the legal process be dropped.</p>
                        <p>In respect to summonses for traffic violations, arrangements have been
                            made with the City, County and State Police to forestall the issuance of
                            summonses, thereby making unnecessary an appeal to the Courts. However,
                            a record of the incident is made and forwarded to the United Nations and
                            the Mission. In case of flagrant violations of laws, the United States
                            would take steps, in conjunction with the Secretary-General to declare
                            the individual <hi rend="italic">persona non grata</hi> and, if
                            necessary, request his recall.</p>
                        <p>Delegation members are, of course, expected to observe all laws and
                            regulations. We have specifically pointed out to them that New York
                            State requires automobile operators to carry insurance against accidents
                            involving personal injury since there was a lack of understanding of
                            this regulation.</p>
                        <p>Members of Delegations are exempt from Federal personal income taxes on
                            income received as salary from foreign Governments; all customs and
                            import duties; the 20 per cent retail excise taxes on jewelry, furs,
                            cosmetics, and luggage; taxes on telephone, telegraph, and cable
                            charges, and transportation taxes. Exemption from manufacturers’ excise
                            taxes is possible only if the article is bought directly from the
                            manufacturer.</p>
                        <p>We have also arranged exemption from the New York State income tax,
                            gasoline tax, liquor taxes and fees on imports, auto registration and
                            license fees; the City Sales Tax and the Hotel occupancy tax; and New
                            Jersey liquor taxes.</p>
                        <p>To secure exemption on each transaction, the buyer must file an exemption
                            form, except in the case of liquor imports, with the merchant.
                            Appropriate forms have been worked out in numerous conferences with the
                            Bureau of Internal Revenue, New York and New Jersey State, and New York
                            City authorities.</p>
                        <p>In order that merchants would understand the system and that it would
                            function smoothly, we have explained it to many retail trade
                            associations, individual stores, petroleum distributing companies and
                            others. We distribute our monthly diplomatic list to several hundred
                            merchants as well as to federal, state and local officials.</p>

                        <p>Although there are obvious objections to the creation of a group of tax
                            exempt citizens, it will be difficult for the United Nations to recruit
                            representative American citizens if their salaries are to be taxed when
                            those of their foreign colleagues are exempt. Most other Members are
                            opposed to continuing the present system whereby the United Nations
                            reimburses its United States employees for income taxes on their
                            salaries. At the last session of the general Assembly, a proposal to

                            reimbursements was averted with some difficulty and embarrassment.
                            Instead, the Assembly repeated its previous request for tax exemption,
                            after discussions in which the United States representative pointed out
                            that the Congress had not yet taken final action and virtually committed
                            the Executive branch to seek reconsideration.<note n="3" xml:id="d29fn3"

                            appropriate for the Secretary to urge the Chairman of the House
                            Committee on Foreign Affairs not to impose a similar reservation. A
                            letter to this effect is attached (Tab B).<note n="5" xml:id="d29fn5">

                            first session in London.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately, the best solution would seem to be exemption from income tax
                            accompanied by a staff contributions plan, under which employees would
                            make to the Organization itself an annual payment comparable to an
                            income tax with similar exemptions and allowances for dependents. The
                            General Assembly at its last session invited the Secretary-General to
                            report on such a plan to the next session and requested that, meanwhile,
                            all Members which have not yet provided income tax immunity should do
                            so.</p>
                        <p>If, as appears likely, the House Committe is unwilling to eliminate the
                            reservation, the next most desirable course would be to substitute a
                            provision making the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, with
                            respect to credits for income taxes paid to foreign governments,
                            applicable to payments made to a United Nations staff contributions
                            scheme. It would appear preferable not to make this alternative
                            suggestion unless the Committee acts unfavorably on the elimination of
                            the reservation.</p>

                            hope that the Committee will give the most careful consideration to the
                            desirability of approving the pending resolution<note n="1"

                            the reservation now attached thereto by the Senate with respect to
                            income tax immunity. You will recall that Section 18(<hi
                                rend="smallcaps">b</hi>) of the Convention provides that officials
                            of the United Nations shall be exempt from taxation on the salaries and
                            emoluments paid to them by the United Nations, and that the Senate, in
                            approving the joint resolution, amended it to withhold the application
                            of this Section from United States nationals.</p>
                        <p>I fully appreciate the reluctance of the Senate to relieve any group

                            to contribute to the financial support of their Government. At the same
                            time, there are in my opinion certain compelling reasons for not
                            including in the Senate Joint Resolution a reservation of the type in

                                    unanimously requested all Members to provide such tax exemption
                                    in order to ensure equality of tax treatment among the staff in
                                    a manner which is equitable among Members. Since it is the

                                    United Nations, it is believed that this Government should
                                    comply with such requests of the General Assembly whenever it
                                    can do so without prejudice to the vital interests of the United

                                    authorized the Secretary-General to reimburse employees for
                                    taxes which they have paid to their national governments on
                                    income received from the United Nations. The cost of such tax
                                    reimbursements to the United Nations is approximately $500,000
                                    annually, of which about $450,000 represents <pb n="58"

                                    budget and is apportioned among all Member States. Despite the
                                    dissatisfaction of many Members at having to contribute to taxes
                                    paid by United States nationals to the United States Government,
                                    the Assembly has agreed to continue the tax reimbursement system

                                    after 1948.</item>

                                    contributions to the United Nations budget in order to meet the

                                    make contributions from their salaries to the United Nations,
                                    based roughly on the income tax structure in the Member nation

                        <p>Approval by the Congress of the pending resolution without a reservation
                            with respect to income taxes would create the best possible atmosphere
                            in which to work out a satisfactory staff contributions plan avoiding
                            the creation of a tax-privileged group. It would also reaffirm the
                            willingness of the United States to co-operate fully in carrying out the
                            declared policy of the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore the hope of the Department of State that the Congress
                            will approve the pending resolution without reservation with respect to
                            income tax. Officials of this Department will be glad to furnish further
                            information on the subject at the convenience of the Committee.<note

                        <p>The meeting was called to decide upon a definition of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> “Headquarters District and its Immediate
                            Vicinity” as related to the problem of individuals attending the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> who would otherwise be considered as
                            inadmissable aliens.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Henkin discussed the five suggested areas and possible delimitation
                            by county lines or by a highway-river-county line combination. Mr.
                            Devaney stated that in his view the size of the area might depend on the
                            legal question of the authority of the Attorney General to control the
                            movements of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> personnel into and within
                            that area. Mr. Henkin indicated that while these questions are of course
                            related, the legal question was under consideration by the Policy
                            Committee on Immigration and Naturalization and that it did not seem
                            appropriate <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0082"/>for this Committee to
                            consider the matter. While it might be helpful to postpone the
                            delimitation of the area until the legal question was decided, Mr.
                            Alexander in particular thought that the area should be settled as soon
                            as possible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Devaney said that a boundary defined by county lines would have the
                            advantage of coinciding with the area of responsibility assigned to
                            immigration enforcement officers. He stated further that while the
                            problem of enforcement would be more difficult in a larger area, there
                            would be also an increased number of violations if the area were not
                            sufficiently liberal. Mr. Mokma thought that a flat radial distance
                            would be easier to observe than a complicated system of outline which
                            might appear clear on paper but in practice would be difficult to
                            observe. The discussion continually recurred to the question whether
                            within the “Headquarters District and its Immediate Vicinity” the
                            Immigration Service might restrict the activities of individual
                            correspondents, representatives of non-governmental organizations and
                            other visitors who are Communists. In that case, Mr. Andrews suggested,
                            if the number of cases involved were not too great each might feasibly
                            be handled on an individual basis and the area of limitation would not
                            be so important.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the question of area it was generally agreed that in view of
                            the fact that the actual location of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> site is already in a vital security area a narrow
                            limitation would accomplish little. It was felt that the area should
                            include reasonable communicating distance around New York City. Mr.
                            Meeker thought that a reasonable area should provide adequate
                            recreational facilities. It was his opinion, shared by Mr. Henkin, that
                            Philadelphia and Atlantic City might be considered within the area.
                            Other members of the meeting felt that “immediate vicinity” should not
                            be construed so broadly as to lose its meaning and its purpose as a
                            confined area. On the other hand Mr. Henkin said that so long as the
                            limitation was not actually related to security the U.S. should be
                            generous and should exert every effort to avoid making the area so
                            restrictive as to interfere with the activities of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> by discouraging individuals who might be
                            limited from coming to the headquarters. Mr. McDermott pointed out that
                            the position taken by the U.S. on the question of a restrictive area
                            would be reflected in the treatment accorded our correspondents in “iron
                            curtain” countries.</p>
                        <p>After much discussion, the members of the Committee approved a
                            “reasonable communicating distance” of approximately 70 miles from New
                            York City and agreed to include:</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I am shocked to read
                            the enclosed U.P. dispatch in last night’s newspaper asserting that—
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The State Department has informed Congress that subversive
                                    agents in an alarming number have entered this country through
                                    the United Nations.”</p>
                            </quote>
                        </p>
                        <p>The dispatch further attributes to State Department officials the
                            statement that— <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“This Government is powerless to do anything about it.”</p>
                            </quote>
                        </p>
                        <p>Finally, a State Department official (Robert C. Alexander, Assistant
                            Chief of the State Department’s Visa Division, Security Unit) is quoted
                            as saying that— <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“These subversives include Moscow-trained terrorists, espionage
                                    agents, aliens who foment discord and others trained in
                                    undercover activities contrary to the peace and good order of
                                    this country.”</p>
                            </quote>
                        </p>
                        <p>I am sure you will join me in agreeing that if any such situation exists,
                            it requires summary attention. I respectfully suggest that there can be
                            no delay. This brings the “cold war” directly home to the internal
                            United States. Still worse: if these quoted statements are true, it
                            means that the very instrumentality (the United Nations) upon <pb n="64"
                                xml:id="pg_64" facs="0084"/>which we depend for peace and security
                            is a serious threat to the very protections which it is presumed to
                            serve.</p>
                        <p>The situation as described in this U.P. dispatch is so unbelievable that
                            I am not accepting it until it is officially confirmed. But I
                            respectfully submit that confirmation or categorical denial is
                            immediately imperative. The publication of this charge will do the
                            United Nations incalculable harm in the United States. I do not need to
                            wait for the reactions to know that it will produce a flood of angry and
                            anxious protests from the country in general and from Congress in
                            particular. Nothing could be better calculated to undermine the United
                            Nations in American public opinion. If true, the situation is
                            insufferable. If untrue, the charges are intolerable.</p>
                        <p>A Special Session of Congress starts next Monday.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d33fn1">In fact it was a reconvening of the Second Session
                                of the 80th Congress, which had not adjourned <hi rend="italic">sine

                                the Second Session began on July 26 and continued until August 7
                                when a second recess took effect. The 80th Congress was never again
                                reconvened however.</note> Its agenda should include the U.N.
                            Headquarters Loan. Favorable action on the loan will be seriously if not
                            permanently jeopardized if the U.N. Headquarters in New York City is an
                            unlimited port of entry for “Moscow-trained terrorists, espionage
                            agents, aliens who foment discord and others trained in undercover
                            activities contrary to the peace and good order of this country.”</p>
                        <p>If this is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the fact,—(I certainly thought we
                            had protected ourselves fully against any such hazard)—I should be able
                            to say so with decisive finality at once. But if this is the fact the
                            first legislation introduced in the Special Session next week should be
                            an amendment to the U.S. Participating statute which will give the
                            Government of the United States complete and unequivocal authority to
                            stop any such subversive invasion. We have no right to control entry
                            into the United Nations Headquarters. But we have every right and duty
                            and obligation to control entry from the U.N. Headquarters into the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>I cannot overemphasize my feeling that this U.P. dispatch poses a
                            question of imminent importance. I shall reach Washington next Sunday. I
                            will greatly appreciate it if at least a preliminary memorandum on this
                            subject may be waiting for me at the Wardman Park Hotel at that time. I
                            regret to intrude upon your other desperately critical problems at the
                            moment, but I see so much potential trouble flowing from this dispatch
                            that I feel we owe it to our United Nations allegiance to clarify the
                            situation without a moment’s delay.</p>
                        <p>With sentiments of great respect, and with warm personal regards, I beg
                            to remain</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Senator Vandenberg</hi>: In the Secretary’s
                            absence from the Department today, I am sending you a preliminary report
                            on the entry of aliens in connection with the United Nations, as
                            requested in your letter of July 21, 1948.</p>
                        <p>We fully appreciate your reaction to the press reports of statements made
                            by certain officers of this Department before staff members of the
                            Senate Judiciary Subcommittee and agree that an immediate clarification
                            is of the greatest importance. The Department of State is now conducting
                            a thorough investigation of the allegations made and of all the
                            circumstances surrounding the testimony.</p>
                        <p>As indicated in the Secretary’s statement to the press on July 21 (Tab
                            A), the Department does not believe, on the basis of our immediate and
                            summary review, that our national security is endangered by the
                            activities of persons entering this country in connection with the
                            United Nations. The safeguards contained in the United Nations Charter,
                            the Headquarters Agreement, and the International Organizations
                            Immunities Act are fully adequate to protect the security of the United
                            States against the abuse of such privileges and immunities.</p>
                        <p>The Charter of the United Nations provides in Article 105 that “the
                            Organization shall enjoy in the territory of each of its Members such
                            privileges and immunities as are necessary for the fulfillment of its
                            purposes”. The same article also provides that “Representatives of the
                            Members of the United Nations and officials of the Organization shall
                            similarly enjoy such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the
                            independent exercise of their functions in connection with the
                            Organization”. Thus, the fundamental law of the Charter establishes the
                            proper functioning of the United Nations as the test of privilege or
                            immunity. Obviously, activities which are not a part of United Nations
                            business and certainly such abuse of privilege as espionage or sabotage
                            are in no sense protected by the Charter.</p>
                        <p>The International Organizations Immunities Act (Public Law 291, 79th
                            Congress, Tab B) contains an important safeguard in Section 8(b):</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“(b) Should the Secretary of State determine that the continued
                                presence in the United States of any person entitled to the benefits
                                of this title is not desirable, he shall so inform the foreign
                                government or international organization concerned, as the case may
                                be, and after such person shall have had a reasonable length of
                                time, to be determined by the Secretary of State, to depart from the
                                United States, he shall cease to be entitled to such benefits.”</p>

                        <p>The Headquarters Agreement between the United Nations and the United
                            States (Tab C) provides in Sections 11 and 13 for the admission of
                            persons who have business at the United Nations Headquarters. Such
                            admission is based upon official business. Activities outside official
                            business are expressly subject to the laws and regulations of the United
                            States regarding the continued residence of aliens, and procedures are
                            set forth for dealing with such situations. You will also note that
                            Section 10 authorizes the United Nations itself to “expel or exclude
                            persons from the headquarters district for violations of its regulations
                            adopted under Section 8 or for other causes”.</p>

                            person here is inconsistent with our national security.</p>
                        <p>The Department has of course always been aware of the necessity for
                            diligence in administering the procedural safeguards summarized in Tab D
                            and at no time have facts been brought to our attention which disclose a
                            threat to the security of the United States. Indeed, the security

                                (not found in Department of State files). In a covering letter, the

                                    study, the Committee I appointed to investigate this matter has
                                    submitted its report. A copy is enclosed. The Committee confirms
                                    the tentative conclusions of Lovett’s earlier letter to you and
                                    rejects the testimony before the Senate Subcommittee as
                                    unwarranted and entirely without foundation. The Committee
                                    concluded that ‘there is adequate statutory authority to exclude
                                    from the United States persons whose presence here is
                                    inconsistent with our national security’ (page 12), and that
                                    ‘existing administrative procedures, and the legislation on
                                    which they are based are sufficient’ to assure the exclusion of
                                    such individuals (pages 12–13).</p>
                                <p>“With respect to these administrative procedures, the Committee
                                    ‘is not satisfied that the practices under the outline of
                                    procedures are satisfactorily coordinated’ (page 14). The
                                    suggestions of the Committee in this respect are to be submitted
                                    to me in a supplementary memorandum which will receive my

                                        Ukrainian and Byelorussian Governments experienced a delay
                                        in getting a visa because they refused to fill out the
                                        application questionnaire required of all Soviet citizens
                                        coming to the United States. The questionnaire was
                                        substantially identical to that required of United States
                                        officials who travel to Russia. The delay, evoked protests
                                        from the governments involved, and subjected the United
                                        States to attack at the sessions of the Human Rights
                                        Commission. It is the position of the United States that the
                                        delay was largely due to the refusal by the delegates to
                                        fill out a reasonable questionnaire. In any event the

                                        issuing a 3(7) visa to Serge Wojewodski, a stateless person
                                        of Russian origin, the husband of a member of the United
                                        Nations Secretariat who is a Belgian national. At this
                                        writing, the visa has not yet been issued.</item>

                            <p>The United States Embassy in Brussels has indicated that in February,
                                when Wojewodski applied for a visa, he was asked for background
                                information, particularly as to his activities in Germany where he
                                had been residing from 1922 to 1947. According to the Embassy, that
                                question apparently embarrassed the applicant and he stated that he
                                did not care to press his application. Later he returned, but it was
                                not until June 18 that he submitted a partial statement as to his
                                sojourn in Germany. Subsequent investigation of intelligence sources
                                in Germany revealed that he had “worked for the Nazis as a radio
                                monitor from 1940–1945 making 450 RM monthly. Only reason did not
                                join NSDAP [Nazi Party] was he was not permitted to although subject
                                felt they were right in their beliefs”.</p>
                            <p>This information has been made available informally to the United
                                Nations and it may be that the United Nations will not press the
                                case, and thus avoid embarrassment for all concerned. Under a
                                resolution of the General Assembly, Nazis may not be employed by the
                                Secretariat, but assuming that Wojewodski was a Nazi, there is no
                                evidence that his wife was. Nevertheless, the United Nations may not
                                wish to insist on the admission to the United States of a former
                                Nazi. If the United Nations should press the case, the fact that the
                                individual is a Nazi is not an adequate basis under the Headquarters
                                Agreement for refusing a visa to a member of the family of a United
                                Nations official. (On the evidence available it probably could not
                                be said that his exclusion is necessary to safeguard the security of
                                the United States within the meaning of Section 6 of Public Law 357.
                                The case is further complicated by the fact that Mrs. Wojewodski, a
                                Secretariat employee, has applied for a change of her status to that
                                of an immigrant. It is feared that if Wojewodski is permitted to
                                come here as a 3(7) nonimmigrant and his wife then achieves
                                immigrant status, the United <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0091"
                                />States will, as a practical matter, have the husband on its hands
                                permanently. If she should achieve immigrant status before the
                                husband gets here, there will arise an interesting question as to
                                whether a resident of the United States employed by the Secretariat
                                is entitled to bring her husband into the United States on a 3(7)
                                visa.)</p>
                            <p>If the case comes up for discussion the United States Delegation
                                should explain that most of the delay was due to the failure of the
                                applicant to fill out a reasonable visa application and supply
                                pertinent information which the United States is entitled to ask in
                                view of Section 6 of Public Law 357 which reserves to the United
                                States the right to take steps to safeguard its security. When
                                Wojewodski’s <hi rend="italic">curriculum vitae</hi> proved
                                incomplete it was reasonable in the circumstances to take time to
                                investigate further. Finally, the United States Delegation should
                                note that the rights accorded by Section 11 of the Headquarters
                                Agreement are conferred on the United Nations. If the United Nations
                                decides not to press its request for a visa in a particular case, no
                                one else has standing to complain. If the United Nations, on the
                                basis of the facts known, decides that it wishes to insist on
                                Wojewodski’s entry, the United States will, of course, live up to
                                its obligations under the Headquarters Agreement.</p>

                                of the Secretariat met with representatives of the United States
                                Government to evolve a procedure for this consultation. Under this
                                procedure applications for accreditation are transmitted by the
                                Secretariat to the Mission in New York which forwards copies to
                                appropriate offices of the Department. The comments of the
                                Department with regard to the accreditation are communicated to the
                                Secretariat through the Mission within 14 days. (The details of the

                            <p>A question has arisen from the desire of the United Nations to
                                accredit as representatives of “other information agencies”
                                individuals who represent non-governmental organizations. It is the
                                view of the Department that, read in their context, the words “other
                                information agencies” refer to “agencies” in the nature of
                                newspapers, radio, television, <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0092"
                                />etc., but a non-governmental organization as such would not
                                qualify. To merit accreditation under the Headquarters Agreement, a
                                representative of an organization would have to show that he
                                represents a publication regularly issued by the organization, and
                                devoting a substantial amount of coverage to <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                                Secretariat officials and representatives of the Department in the

                            <p>It is not unlikely that the United States will be attacked for
                                delaying or refusing passports to American nationals employed by the
                                Secretariat who were ordered abroad on official business.</p>
                            <p>Even apart from the Headquarters Agreement, it is clear that the
                                Charter of the United Nations obligates the United States not to
                                impede the travel abroad on official business of Secretariat
                                officials. The obligation of the United States, however, is to
                                permit the travel of such individuals. It is not obliged to issue to
                                all such individuals the protection of an American passport. Under
                                existing law the Department may waive the requirement of a passport,
                                and permit the individual to leave the United States and to return
                                without such documentation. The country of destination, under the
                                Charter of the United Nations, would also be required to admit the
                                Secretariat official whether or not he had an American passport. If
                                the individual is traveling to a country which is not a Member of
                                the United Nations, it is still probable that he would be admitted
                                without an American passport, especially if the United Nations
                                issues him a <hi rend="italic">Laissez-Passer</hi>. (Since the
                                United States will have waived the requirement of a passport for
                                re-entry into the United States, there is no danger that if that
                                country admits the individual, it will later be unable to send him
                                back to the United States.) Moreover, it may well be argued that the
                                obligations of the United States are met when it permits the
                                individual to leave; any obstacles to travel which he might meet
                                because he had no passport would be imposed not by this country but
                                by those to which he must travel. In any event, there would have to
                                be a positive showing that without such passport the individual can
                                not perform his official duties, before the United States might be
                                required to issue him one.</p>
                            <p>The United States Delegation might point out that while one such
                                official (Ursula Wassermann) was refused a passport, she was
                                permitted to travel on a United Nations <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Laissez-Passer</hi>. The refusal of the United States to accord
                                her the protection of a national passport did not impinge on her
                                status as an international civil servant and in no way interfered
                                with the operations of the United Nations.</p>
                            <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0093"/>
                            <p>In view of the admitted obligation under the Charter, it has not been
                                necessary to discuss the question of travel with reference to the
                                Headquarters Agreement. The requirements of the Agreement might
                                become crucial, however, if the Department should refuse to permit
                                the travel of individuals who do not come within the Charter
                                provisions. Thus, for example, American correspondents accredited to
                                the United Nations, or representatives of American non-governmental
                                organizations, may, in individual instances, be unable to obtain a
                                passport to go abroad. Whether the United States must allow them,
                                for example, to travel to Paris for the General Assembly would
                                depend on whether they are covered by Section 11 of the Headquarters
                                Agreement. There is uncertainty and disagreement as to whether the
                                Agreement, and particularly Section 11, was intended to apply to
                                American nationals. (Ultimately, if the United States and the United
                                Nations disagree on this question, it may have to be submitted for
                                arbitration pursuant to Section 21 of the Agreement.) For present
                                purposes, it is hoped that the question will not arise and that,
                                whether as a matter of legal obligation or Departmental policy, all
                                individuals in these categories will be permitted to travel to the
                                General Assembly. (The Legal Adviser has recently recommended that,
                                in order to avoid the difficult legal question, the Department
                                should generally permit American correspondents accredited by the
                                United Nations to go to the General Assembly in Paris.)</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>By this Section, the United States granted full diplomatic
                                privileges, subject to corresponding conditions and obligations, to
                                every person designated by a Member as its principal resident
                                representative to the United Nations or as a resident representative
                                with the rank of Ambassador or minister plenipotentiary, and such
                                resident members of their staffs as may be agreed upon between the
                                Secretary General, the Government of the United States and the
                                Government of the Member concerned. In implementation of this
                                Section, procedures have been developed whereby the Secretary
                                General receives lists of the persons covered and transmits them to
                                the United States. Individuals accepted by the United States for
                                listing received, under arrangements made with the appropriate
                                American authorities, exemptions from certain excise taxes (e.g.
                                luxuries, telegraph, cable, telephone and radio communications,
                                transportation, insurance, etc.) as well as taxes on gasoline, hotel
                                taxes, sales taxes, and certain customs duties. The cooperation of
                                American authorities in this respect has been excellent, and will
                                undoubtedly be the subject of commendation in the Secretary
                                General’s report.</p>

                            <p>Problems are, however, arising under Section 15, some of which may
                                possibly be raised at the sessions of the Sixth Committee. At this
                                writing, the Department may be about to refuse diplomatic privileges
                                to two individuals presented for listing by Member governments.
                                Diego Suarez Costa was appointed Counselor of the Colombian
                                Delegation, but the Protocol Division of the Department has refused
                                to list him because the alien has been a resident of the United
                                States for many years, and in the opinion of the Protocol Division
                                he does not possess the necessary qualifications, does not in fact
                                do the work of a member of the Delegation, and is not, therefore, a
                                bona fide appointee. Similar action is contemplated in the case of
                                Julio Pocaterra who has been Consul General of Venezuela in New York
                                and was also added as Minister ad honorem of the Venezuelan
                                Delegation. The Protocol Division has indicated that it would be
                                willing to list the individual only if he ceased to be Consul
                                General and became an active rather than an ad honorem member of the
                                delegation.</p>
                            <p>These cases may raise claims that the United States is not living up
                                to Section 15. That Section, however, requires privileges and
                                immunities only for “such resident members of their staffs as may be
                                agreed upon by the Secretary General, the Government of the United
                                States and the government of the Member concerned.” While that may
                                mean primarily “agreement” as to the categories or classifications
                                of individuals entitled to privileges and immunities, the language
                                of the Section might also seem to permit the United States to refuse
                                to agree to the listing of a particular member of the staff. In any
                                event, it is always free to challenge the bona fides of a claim to
                                privileges, and that will be the basis of our action if the United
                                States actually refuses to list either of these individuals.</p>

                            <p>In the exchange of notes which brought the Agreement into effect,
                                Representative Austin specifically stated that the United States
                                approved the Agreement subject to the provisions of Public Law 357.
                                At sessions of the Sixth Committee, Mr. Fahy, the former Legal
                                Adviser, made it clear that Section 6 must be considered as part of
                                the Agreement, that the Headquarters Agreement was approved by
                                Congress only subject to the reservation in Section 6, and that if
                                this section is not accepted, the Agreement is not in effect.
                                Nevertheless the United Nations has carefully avoided giving
                                recognition to Section 6, and the matter will undoubtedly be the
                                subject of continued controversy. The position of the United States
                                Delegation, however, is clear. The requirements of Section 6 apply
                                to the entire Agreement and must be given recognition
                                accordingly.</p>

                            <p>A current problem related to Section 6 has been the subject of
                                preliminary negotiation between the United States and the United
                                Nations. Section 13(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) recognizes the right
                                of the United States to limit individuals to the headquarters
                                district and “its immediate vicinity”. Section 6 of the Joint
                                Resolution [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] approving the Headquarters
                                Agreement specifies that “the Headquarters District and its
                                immediate vicinity” is to be “defined and fixed in a supplementary
                                agreement between the Government of the United States and the United
                                Nations.”</p>
                            <p>Exploratory discussions between <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>
                                and Secretariat officials indicate a reluctance by the United
                                Nations to enter into such a supplemental agreement. In part, that
                                reluctance is based on a refusal to take action which would indicate
                                a recognition of the Section 6 reservation. In addition, while the
                                United Nations consented to the provision in Section 13(<hi
                                    rend="italic">e</hi>) recognizing the right of the United States
                                to impose the limitation, the United Nations is not anxious to be a
                                party to such limitations or to participate in any way in imposing
                                them. The Secretariat is particularly unwilling to appear to approve
                                the imposition of such restrictions before the United States adheres
                                to the General Convention. Secretariat officials point out that, as
                                provided in the Headquarters Agreement, the Agreement and the
                                General Convention were intended to be read together as
                                complementary instructions. When in 1947 Congress failed to complete
                                action on the General Convention, the United Nations accepted the
                                Headquarters Agreement alone because of its importance for immediate
                                operation and because it was expected that Congress would ratify the
                                Convention shortly thereafter. In fact, however, the Agreement read
                                by itself does not give a full picture of the rights and status of
                                the United Nations. Specifically, it is the opinion of the
                                Secretariat that the General Convention, by providing for immunity
                                “from immigration restrictions”, <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76"
                                    facs="0096"/>would prevent the United States from limiting to
                                the headquarters district and its immediate vicinity members of
                                delegations and Secretariat officials. Until the United States, by
                                adhering to the Convention, agrees not to impose these limitations
                                on individuals in these categories, the United Nations considers it
                                premature to enter into the supplemental agreement to define the
                                area.</p>
                            <p>It may be that the Secretariat fears that the negotiation of the
                                supplemental agreement is a prelude to steps by the United States
                                towards confining many individuals, including Secretariat officials,
                                to this area. Such fears stem perhaps from the unhappy fuss
                                resulting from unfortunate and unwarranted statements by certain
                                officers of the Visa Division before a Senate sub-committee to the
                                effect that the United Nations is being used as a cloak for hundreds
                                of subversives. (See the final section of this paper.) In fact,
                                however, even apart from the General Convention, under existing law
                                their fears are unfounded. It is true that under the Headquarters
                                Agreement, apparently, only members of delegations entitled to
                                diplomatic privileges under Section 15 could not be confined to the
                                limited area. However, the International Organizations Immunities
                                Act, Public Law 291, 79th Congress, provides that with regard to the
                                laws regulating entry into and departure from the United States,
                                Member representatives to international organizations and officers
                                and employees of such organizations shall be treated like officers
                                and employees of foreign governments. The Department has been acting
                                on the assumption that this provision would prevent the impositon of
                                limitations to the headquarters district and vicinity on individuals
                                covered by the Immunities Act.</p>
                            <p>In view of the attitude of the United Nations in this matter, the
                                Department will probably proceed to define the area unilaterally, so
                                that limitations may be imposed, if necessary, pending ratification
                                by Congress of the General Convention and the subsequent negotiation
                                of the supplemental agreement. Officials of the Secretariat are
                                aware, of course, that since there will be no such agreement in
                                effect when Congress considers the General Convention, it is not
                                unlikely that Congress might itself wish to determine what area
                                shall be included as the “headquarters district and inmmediate
                                vicinity”. Since the question has been raised, Congress may also see
                                fit to note that nothing in the Convention shall abridge the right
                                of the United States to limit to this area all categories of
                                individuals including Secretariat officials.</p>
                            <p>These considerations and speculations are set forth for the
                                information of the Delegation. It is hoped that the question of
                                limitations to the headquarters area will not arise at the General
                                Assembly, and indeed it is to avoid that possibility that the
                                Department has not formally raised the question with the Secretariat
                                after informal discussions <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0097"
                                />disclosed that no agreement would be forthcoming. If the question
                                should arise, however, the delegation should indicate that the
                                United States may find it necessary to define the area tentatively,
                                pending a supplemental agreement. The delegation may assure the
                                United Nations that there is no present intention to begin limiting
                                large numbers of individuals to this area, that under our existing
                                law it is not likely that Secretariat officials and members of the
                                delegations would be so limited, and that there is no present
                                intention on the part of the Government of the United States to seek
                                modification of the law in this respect. The delegation should be
                                careful, however, to avoid committing the United States to the view
                                that the General Convention would prevent the United States from
                                limiting Secretariat officials to this area.</p>

                                    United States</hi>.</p>
                            <p>Section 6 quoted above provides that nothing in the Agreement shall
                                be construed as in any way abridging the right of the United States
                                to safeguard its own security. To date there has been no occasion
                                for the United States to invoke this provision. No attempt has been
                                made to exclude or deport any individual connected with the United
                                Nations, or to take any other steps which might affect the
                                operations of the United Nations.</p>
                            <p>Related to this section is the recent stir caused by the testimony of
                                two officers of the Visa Division before a Senate sub-committee, in
                                which they alleged that hundreds of subversives are in the United
                                States because of some connection with the United Nations. This
                                testimony received widespread publicity, and caused considerable
                                resentment among the members of the United Nations Secretariat. It
                                also gained attention in the newspapers of Eastern European
                                countries, and it may be expected, therefore, that the question
                                might arise in some way at the next session of the Assembly.</p>
                            <p>The United States Delegation should point out that the testimony of
                                the Visa Division officers did not represent an official view of any
                                part of the Department; that it was immediately repudiated in
                                statements to the press by the Secretary of State; that it was
                                denied by testimony before the same sub-committee by the Chief of
                                the Visa Division, as well as by ranking officers of the Department;
                                [that the matter was finally buried by an unequivocal report by
                                three citizens who were called in by the Secretary of State to make
                                a thorough investigation of the matter.]<note n="5" xml:id="d35fn5"

                            </p>
                            <p>The United States Delegation might point out that while the incident
                                was unfortunate, it has resulted in clearing the air and removing
                                suspicions and misapprehensions on the part of some people in the
                                    <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0098"/>United States. Also, the
                                Delegation should note that the United States is a democratic
                                country which must allow the free expression of individual opinions,
                                and which provides for appropriate Congressional investigation of
                                governmental operations as a basis for intelligent legislation. It
                                should also be emphasized that the entire incident was a local and
                                internal affair within the United States Government, and that the
                                United Nations and its members must not allow themselves to be
                                disturbed by what might be said about the United Nations by
                                individual American citizens. Nothing that was said or done in
                                connection with this incident in any way interfered with the
                                operations of the United Nations, and the attitude of the United
                                States Government in the handling of the entire affair reaffirms the
                                full intentions of this Government to fulfill in every way its
                                obligations under the Charter and the Headquarters Agreement.</p>

                            Judging from the Section on the General Convention which is contained in
                            the Annual Report of the Secretary-General, the report on the General
                            Convention <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0099"/>will be largely
                            expository and will contain little controversial matter. Apparently it
                            will list the 25 countries who have adhered to the convention and report
                            on action taken by other nations. In the absence of some unforseen item
                            which may be objectionable, the United States Delegation should join in
                            approving the report.</p>

                        <p>The failure of the Congress of the United States to complete action to
                            approve the Convention may be a cause of adverse comment in the Sixth
                            Committee. The United States Delegation should point out that the Senate
                            of the United States passed <gloss target="#t_SJRes1">S.J. Res.</gloss>
                            136 approving the Convention and that the Foreign Affairs Committee of
                            the House of Representatives reported out <gloss target="#t_HR1"
                                >H.R.</gloss> 6802 which, <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>, also
                            approved the Convention. The pressure of urgent legislation at the end
                            of the regular session, and the feeling that it was inappropriate to
                            consider the Convention at the “special” session, prevented final action
                            by this Congress. However, Representative Martin, Speaker of the House,
                            and Majority Leader Halleck, issued a formal statement which said, in
                            part, that “as Speaker and Leader, respectively, we have assured the
                            members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs that these other provisions
                            of their bill will be brought by us before the House of Representatives
                            for debate” at the opening of the 81st Congress. While it will be
                            necessary to introduce the legislation anew in both houses, it is not
                            anticipated that there will be major difficulty in obtaining
                            Congressional accession to the Convention.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>It is not unlikely that the Committee will discuss the question of
                            reservations to the Convention, as well as the specific items to which
                            some nations have made reservation. In such discussions the United
                            States Delegation should keep in mind that the Senate made certain
                            reservations when it approved the Convention in 1947 and that these will
                            probably be included in the final action of Congress.</p>

                                Obligations</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is virtually certain that in approving the Convention, Congress will
                            reserve the right of the United States to impose obligations of military
                            service on American citizens (and, perhaps, residents) who are employed
                            by the Secretariat. It has been the position of the United States that
                            military service when required by law is an obligation of citizenship
                            from which no citizen should be exempt merely because of <pb n="80"
                                xml:id="pg_80" facs="0100"/>his employment by an international
                            organization. The United States deems this obligation to be an implied
                            exception to the privileges and immunities contemplated by Article 105
                            of the Charter, and the United States will make that exception explicit
                            when it approves the Convention. The United States Delegation might also
                            point out that with regard to the League of Nations, Switzerland
                            apparently did not exempt employees and officers of the League who were
                            Swiss nationals. Also, the United States does not exempt individuals
                            merely because they are officials of the American Government.</p>
                        <p>The United States Delegation should be careful to indicate, however, that
                            the United States is fully conscious of its obligations to the United
                            Nations and will, in the administration of its service laws, take the
                            steps necessary to assure that the operations of the United Nations will
                            not be disrupted. Under the Selective Service Act of 1948 it is expected
                            that provision will be made, either in the regulations or by
                            administrative practice, to permit the deferment of key personnel of the
                            Secretariat in the same manner as important officials of the United
                            States Government, or key employees in essential industries.</p>
                        <p>The reservation under discussion applies, of course, only to American
                            nationals and residents. With respect to Secretariat officials who are
                            in the United States only by virtues of their status with the
                            Organization, the United States will give full recognition to the
                            requirements of the General Convention. Thus, the administrative
                            regulations under the Selective Service Act of 1948 specifically exempts
                            from registration any alien who has not declared his intention to become
                            a citizen of the United States “provided: …</p>

                            6802, which was reported out by the House Foreign Affairs Committee
                            contained what may be deemed a reservation with regard to the <hi
                                rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi>. The Bills provided that nothing
                            in Article <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0101"/>VII of the Convention
                            shall be deemed to abridge the right of the United States to require
                            visas and passports. It might be argued that this is not a reservation,
                            since there is nothing in the Convention which requires a Member Nation
                            to cancel its normal passport and visa requirements. These, it might be
                            noted, pertain even with respect to diplomatic officials of foreign
                            governments. As is noted in the annual report of the Secretary General,
                            however, the Report of the Sixth Committee on the Headquarters Agreement
                            states that the position of the United States in effect narrows
                            considerably the intended usefulness of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >laissez-passer</hi>.</p>
                        <p>If the question arises for discussion the United States Delegation may
                            note that the United States has been faithful to its obligations under
                            the Charter and the Headquarters Agreement. Under the International
                            Organizations Immunities Act, it has been according to officers and
                            employees of the Secretariat the treatment accorded to officers and
                            employees of foreign governments. In no case has the insistence of the
                            United States on a passport or visa interfered with the freedom of the
                            individual to leave or enter the United States on United Nations
                            business. The Delegation might also add that a reservation by Congress
                            on this point would not prevent the Government of the United States from
                            giving to the <hi rend="italic">laissez-passer</hi>, as an
                            administration matter, such recognition as might prove necessary to
                            facilitate the travel of United Nations personnel. (For a discussion of
                            the possible criticism of the United States in the matter of travel of
                            individuals on United Nations business, see the Comment Paper on the
                            implementation of the Headquarters Agreement.)</p>

                        <p>In <gloss target="#t_SJRes1">S.J. Res.</gloss> 136, the Senate reserved
                            the right of the United States to tax salaries paid by the United
                            Nations to United States nationals. <gloss target="#t_HR1">H.R.</gloss>
                            6802, reported favorably by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, did not
                            contain this reservation. In its Report, the House Committee stated:</p>
                        <p>“…<note n="2" xml:id="d36fn2">Omission indicated in the source
                                text.</note> It should be emphasized that the committee’s proposal
                            does not go back upon the reservation stated at the time the Convention
                            on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations was drawn up.
                            That reservation stated simply that the exemption of American nationals
                            from taxation was the business of the United States Congress.”</p>
                        <p>It is possible that the final action of Congress approving the convention
                            will not contain the reservation. The Delegation may say that if
                            Congress insists on the reservation, it is hoped that it will take steps
                            to assure that in the event that the staff contributions plan is
                            instituted, United States nationals on the Secretariat will not be
                            subject to a <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0102"/>form of double
                            taxation. To this end, Congress might be willing to allow the American
                            national to credit against the federal income tax on his <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> salary any amounts paid to the United
                            Nations under a staff contributions scheme. In this way Congress would
                            make practicable the establishment of the staff contribution system
                            contemplated and would eliminate any inequities which might otherwise
                            result from the Congressional reservation of the power to tax the
                            individual’s income.</p>
                        <p>The staff contributions plan and its relation to Congressional action on
                            the General Convention is on the preliminary agenda as a separate item

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that as a
                            result of a review of existing arrangements with the United Nations for
                            the furnishing of information to the United States Government concerning
                            alien members of the United Nations Secretariat and members of
                            Delegations to the United Nations, an agreement has been reached with
                            the Secretary-General of that organization for a revision of those
                            arrangements. That agreement is in the form of an exchange of letters,
                            dated respectively May 3 and August 16, 1948, between the
                            Secretary-General of the United Nations and myself, and copies thereof
                            are attached hereto.<note n="1" xml:id="d37fn1">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The functioning of the original arrangements since they were made in 1947
                            disclosed that certain changes were desirable in order to establish with
                            increased efficiency and accuracy more complete lists of Secretariat and
                            Delegation personnel. Accordingly, on May 3, 1948, I suggested to the
                            Secretary-General that existing arrangements be reviewed, and pointed
                            out the desirability of certain specific modifications. As a result of
                            that letter, several meetings were held between representatives of the
                            Mission and of the United Nations at which the technical, detailed
                            questions involved in the suggested changes were discussed. At those
                            meetings the United Nations officials displayed a willingness to
                            cooperate fully and very readily agreed to the suggested revisions. The
                            Secretary-General has confirmed the revised arrangements in the enclosed
                            letter of August 16, 1948.</p>
                        <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0103"/>
                        <p>Pursuant to my request for a new, comprehensive and up-to-date
                            compilation of information concerning alien United Nations Secretariat
                            members, the Bureau of Personnel of the United Nations has agreed to
                            furnish in September of this year as complete a list as possible of all
                            alien Secretariat members and members of their families and their
                            servants. This list will include information as to the title of the
                            staff member and as to each person listed, his nationality, local
                            address, passport number, and type of visa. In January 1949 a
                            supplementary list of the same nature will be furnished by the Bureau of
                            Personnel.</p>
                        <p>The revised arrangements further provide, as to alien members of the
                            United Nations Secretariat, that the Bureau of Personnel of the United
                            Nations will forward to the Mission, prior to the fifteenth of each
                            month, five copies of lists of appointments and terminations which have
                            occurred prior to the 25th of the preceding month. The lists of
                            appointments will include, in addition to the name and title of post of
                            each employee, the names of members of his family and of his servants
                            who are with him in the United States and as to each person, his
                            nationality, local address, passport number and type of visa. The lists
                            of terminations will include, in addition to the name of each staff
                            member involved, the date of termination, nationality, passport number,
                            type of visa, local address, and a statement of the intentions of the
                            staff member as to continued residence in or departure from the United
                            States. With regard to continued residence in the United States, this
                            statement of intentions will indicate that the staff member has made
                            appropriate arrangements with immigration authorities. With regard to
                            departure, the statement will indicate the scheduled date and port of
                            departure, and the name of the steamship or air line being used. The
                            United Nations representatives have been informed that the absence of a
                            statement of intentions either as to continued residence in the United
                            States or as to departure therefrom will be treated by the United States
                            as evidence of an intent on the part of the staff member to violate the
                            immigration laws.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that the furnishing of departure information on a
                            monthly basis represents a change from the previous procedure of
                            furnishing such information every two weeks. This change was necessary
                            to enable the United Nations Bureau of Personnel to supply additional
                            information as agreed.</p>
                        <p>As to members of Delegations, the revised arrangements provide that,
                            commencing after the next General Assembly session, all information
                            regarding such members will come from one source in the United Nations
                            Secretariat.</p>
                        <p>It has also been agreed that the Chief of Protocol of the United Nations
                            will furnish to the Mission as soon as possible an up-to-date list <pb
                                n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0104"/>of all members of permanent
                            Delegations and members of their families and servants.</p>
                        <p>In order to supplement the information which is now received from the
                            United Nations concerning members of Delegations entitled to diplomatic
                            privileges and immunities by virtue of Section 15 of Public Law 357—80th
                            Congress, the Chief of Protocol of the United Nations will furnish
                            monthly to the Mission, commencing after the next session of the General
                            Assembly, five copies of lists indicating the appointment or termination
                            of assignment of members of permanent Delegations other than those
                            entitled to diplomatic privileges and immunities. These lists will
                            contain, in addition to the name and title of such persons, the names of
                            members of their families and household servants.</p>
                        <p>In the future, the Chief of Protocol of the United Ntaions will furnish
                            to the mission lists of Delegation members who have come to the United
                            States for single sessions of United Nations bodies. These lists will
                            contain information similar to that furnished in the above-mentioned
                            monthly lists of appointments and terminations of assignment of
                            Delegation members, together with a statement of the sessions attended.

                        <p>Failure of the United States Congress to ratify the Convention according
                            income tax immunity for their income from the United Nations to United
                            States nationals serving with the Secretariat has necessitated each year
                            a decision by the General Assembly to reimburse staff members for such
                            national taxes. This procedure has resulted in continuing charges
                            against the United States that the United States Treasury was benefiting
                            as a result of payments by other Members of the United Nations. The
                            United States has indicated that complete tax immunity for its nationals
                            was repugnant to basic American principles. The Delegation has reserved
                            its position on the tax immunity question and has abstained from voting
                            on the question of reimbursement of taxes. The Staff Assessment Plan
                            developed by the Secretariat and a Committee of Tax Experts,<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d38fn3">The creation of a group of five tax experts was the
                                result of a proposal made initially by the United States delegate in

                            including an expert from the United States Government, is an effort to
                            deal with this problem by levying an assessment against each member of
                            the United Nations staff at rates between those of the United States and
                            the higher Canadian rates. To make this plan meaningful, the United
                            States Government will be expected to provide tax immunity for its
                            nationals or provide that assessments paid to the United Nations may be
                            offset against taxes due the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of Resolution A is to adopt a tax plan; Resolution B to
                            readjust salaries from the present “net” to a gross basis; and
                            Resolution <gloss target="#t_C1">C</gloss> calls on Governments to take
                            necessary legislative action to protect their nationals from liability
                            for double taxation. Resolution D authorizes the Secretary-General to
                            continue reimbursements of staff members for national income taxes on
                            United Nations salaries pending the acceptance of the Convention by
                            Members or the enactment of necessary double-taxation legislation.</p>

                            merely Resolution D on the grounds that some pressure on the United
                            States Congress is required to induce it to agree to exemption of United

                            question, but if it becomes apparent that no other Government is
                            prepared to defend the draft resolutions, the United States should speak

                        <p>An important area of agreement was reached between the United States and
                            the United Nations in March 1948 with the conclusion of the negotiation
                            providing for the financing of the building and furnishing of the
                            permanent United Nations headquarters facilities in New York City. The
                            essential provision was the granting of an interest-free loan of
                            $65,000,000 by the United States to the United Nations, to be repaid in
                            annual installments over a period of thirty years extending from 1951 to
                            1982.</p>
                        <p>Agreement as to broad principles and many details had been reached by
                            this Government and the United Nations by the end of 1947 (see <ref

                                75</ref>; and final details were worked out early in 1948. On March
                            23, 1948 the agreement was signed by Ambassador Warren R. Austin, United
                            States Representative at the United Nations, and Mr. Trygve Lie,
                            Secretary-General of the United Nations, subject to the approval of the
                            United States Congress. For text, see 62 Stat. (pt. 3) 3725 and Treaties

                        <p>On April 7, 1948 the Agreement was transmitted by President Truman to the
                            Congress, with a strong message asking for approval. Bills were
                            introduced separately in the two Houses, and the Senate took favorable
                            action on May 7 (S.J. 212). But action in the House of Representatives
                            became snarled in the omnibus bill (<gloss target="#t_HR1">H.R.</gloss>
                            6802). The <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0108"/>House finally on
                            August 5 accepted the Senate bill, S.J. 212, in the reconvened session
                            of the Congress which met on July 26. On approval by the President on
                            August 11 this legislation became Public Law 903; for text of the joint
                            resolution with provisions of the agreement, see 62 Stat. 1286.</p>
                        <p>The United States Administration had been most anxious that the loan
                            agreement receive approval before the Congress adjourned; and this was
                            one of three actions specifically requested by President Truman in his
                            message to the reconvened session on July 27; for text of the
                            President’s Message, see Department of State <hi rend="italic"
                                >Bulletin</hi>, August 8, 1948, page 185. On the occasion of his
                            approval on August 11, President Truman issued a statement expressing
                            his deep gratification that the Congress had completed action “on this
                            important measure”, declaring that “The loan demonstrates our faith in
                            the future of the United Nations . . . . it is another example of the
                            solidarity of the American people in behalf of our national policy of
                            strengthening the United Nations and the cause of world peace and

                        subscribed in the Crimea, in which they reaffirmed their faith in the

                        proclaims that ‘only with the continuing and growing co-operation and

                    <p>Ambassador Luis Padilla Nervo has discussed with me on a number of occasions
                        the reasons which have convinced him of the need for the resolution which he
                        recently introduced in the General Committee (this item has now been
                        allocated to Committee I). This resolution is entitled: “Appeal to the Great
                        Powers to renew their efforts to compose their differences and establish a
                        lasting peace.” It goes back beyond the organization of the United Nations
                        and expresses confidence that the great Allied Powers would determine their
                        policy in the spirit of the declaration which they subscribed in the Crimea.
                        It recalls also the Atlantic Charter and the Churchill–Roosevelt–Stalin
                        declaration signed at Yalta. It also recommends that the Powers associate
                        with them in the performance of such a noble task the states signatories of
                        the Washington declaration of 1 January 1942 either through the General
                        Assembly or by means of a special conference of all the states which
                        subscribed or adhered to that declaration. He repeated his previously
                        expressed conviction that no decision is possible in the Security Council on
                        matters such as, for instance, the Berlin question, about which the Soviets
                        and the Western Powers are diametrically opposed. He feels therefore that
                        eventually the whole problem will in some way or other at some time reach
                        the General Assembly. He thinks that if his resolution had been previously
                        adopted it will furnish a point of reference and help to set the level of
                        the discussions which will ensue. This debate would then place the
                        controversy before world public opinion in such a way as to justify in the
                        eyes of the world whatever serious eventualities that might develop. While
                        he did not say so in so many words I got the impression that he meant a
                        clear-cut presentation and justification of any measures which might have to
                        be taken, including armed conflict.<note n="1" xml:id="d42fn1">The First

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Chairman</hi>, my Delegation desires to express its
                        appreciation to the Delegate of the Government of Mexico for the spirit of
                        cooperation which has animated him in introducing the Draft Resolution.</p>
                    <p>We are fully aware that this Draft Resolution has been introduced in response
                        to the deep sentiment of the Members of this General Assembly who have been
                        disturbed by the growing tensions amongst the Great Powers. We realize that
                        the Members of this Assembly wish above all to re-establish a fuller spirit
                        of Great Power cooperation, without which our efforts must necessarily
                        suffer. We recognize and welcome the desire of all those who support the
                        Mexican resolution to do everything they can to reduce international
                        friction.</p>
                    <p>It is not our purpose to participate in the debate on this resolution. Since
                        the resolution is addressed to the larger Powers and constitutes an effort
                        to establish harmony among them, we believe the Committee would agree that
                        it would not be entirely appropriate for us to enter the debate on the
                        underlying issues which have given rise to the proposal or, for that matter,
                        on the terms of the resolution itself. Needless to say, my Government will
                        give the most serious attention to the terms of any resolution which is
                        passed by the General Assembly in this field.</p>
                    <p>In the interest of the spirit of harmony, which the sponsor of this Draft
                        Resolution is seeking to obtain, I offer the observation that there may be
                        certain points of detail in the Draft Resolution which may raise elements of
                        disagreement among those to whom the resolution is addressed. For example,
                        the present wording of the fifth paragraph of the preamble is not entirely
                        clear and may open up rather than reconcile certain differences in point of
                        view. More important, I would invite your attention to Paragraph 4 of the
                        operative part of the resolution. That paragraph expresses a broad point of
                        view which has been strongly supported in the past by my Government. At the
                        same time, we recognize that the subject is one upon which the larger Powers
                        have not found it easy to agree.</p>
                    <p>It might contribute to the purposes of the resolution, therefore, if the
                        Honorable Delegate of Mexico would consult with the larger Powers with a
                        view to making such drafting changes as would remove specific elements of
                        difference. My Delegation would hope that, after <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93"
                            facs="0113"/>such informal consultation, the mover of this resolution
                        would then be in a position to suggest changes to this Committee which might
                        permit it to be adopted without objection.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Dulles said that he had prepared a substitute statement for use in
                        Committee 1 in the place of the paper before the Delegation. He felt the
                        other paper (US(P)/A/C.1/153)<note n="1" xml:id="d44fn1">
                            <hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> rather suggested that the Committee
                        undertake some redrafting to make it acceptable. He thought that if the
                        Mexican resolution were treated as a serious directive we would get involved
                        in an interminable wrangle. He was, accordingly, suggesting this
                        alternative. He then read his own draft statement<note n="2" xml:id="d44fn2"
                            >Not found in Department of State files; but see <hi rend="italic"
                                >infra</hi>.</note> to the Delegation. It made the following points:
                        The United States views the proposed resolution sympathetically and accepts
                        the underlying principle that while certain powers have the right of
                        initiation on the peace terms, this right should be used fairly. These great
                        powers had both the right and the responsibility, which if not properly
                        exercised made these matters a legitimate concern for other states. The
                        United States did not intend to discuss the resolution as if it were a
                        technical directive. Such discussion might lead to nothing at all. The
                        United States recognized the need for early conclusion of the peace treaties
                        and pledged itself to renew the efforts sought by the resolution for swift
                        conclusion of the peace treaties.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cohen said he liked Mr. Dulles’ statement very much but wanted to make
                        two observations: it might produce discussion which, if started, would be
                        difficult to stop. The resolution referred to agreements between three
                        rather than five Powers. The most important question was whether there
                        should be any comment on the last portion of the operative section of the
                        draft putting forward the views of the Latin American governments whose
                        invitation to the peace conferences the United States had consistently
                        supported. For example, because of obligations to the Latin American states,
                        the United States had felt obliged at the 1946 Moscow Conference to make a
                        proposal that all states in the war be invited to the Peace Conferences.
                        This <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0114"/>was simply an attempt to work
                        out accommodations of this view, to which the United States had no
                        objection. He thought there was some danger that people might suspect that
                        this country was behind this particular part of the resolution. For that
                        reason, he wondered whether it would help reduce debate if we merely
                        suggested that there should be drafting changes made. Certainly on the
                        question of participation in the Peace Conferences it should be frankly
                        admitted that this was the view which the United States endorsed.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he did not quite understand Mr. Cohen’s point. Mr. Cohen
                        said his idea was that Mr. Dulles might add his two thoughts to his
                        statement. Mr. Dulles said that if we once got into the question of drafting
                        changes it would be like opening up Pandora’s Box, as to who was entitled to
                        participate and all the matters through which the United States had gone at
                        Moscow. Mr. Cohen said his purpose was to avoid just that. If the resolution
                        remained as it was, it was his feeling that just such a discussion would
                        start. If the United States said nothing it was all right but discussions
                        might start if no way was found to omit this paragraph. Mr. Dulles agreed it
                        would be desirable if Paragraph 4 could be omitted altogether. He was rather
                        hopeless as to this because he did not think agreement could be gotten on
                        the deletion of the last paragraph, which he regarded as a drive on the part
                        of certain states to get into peace-making. It was, he thought, better to
                        say this was a pious resolution and the United States agreed with it in
                        principle and let it go at that.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Thorp said that, since this was simply an appeal to the Great Powers, he
                        did not think the United States should vote for it itself. Mr. Dulles said
                        that it was his idea that he should abstain on the vote as it was primarily
                        an appeal to ourselves. Mr. Cohen thought it would be very good if
                        discussion could be avoided altogether. Mr. Dulles said he would make a
                        statement along the lines of that he had read to the Delegation initially,
                        then, if discussion developed, the question of the deletion of the fourth

                        clause which he pointed out would bring up the Japanese Peace Treaty. This
                        clause supported the Soviet thesis for drafting the Japanese Peace Treaty.
                        There were also a number of inaccuracies in the resolution, for example, the
                        reference to the second Moscow Conference when there was no such conference.
                        The whole idea, he pointed out, was quite contradictory to the statement
                        made by the Secretary in his opening speech. He liked Mr. Dulles’ speech
                        very much but would like to see the inaccuracies in the resolution
                        corrected. It was agreed that the best way to handle this matter would be to
                        take up the individual parts in a private conversation with Padilla Nervo.
                        It was further agreed that Mr. Dulles’ draft should be used in the
                        debate.</p>

                    <p>“<gloss target="#t_USDel1">USDel</gloss> views sympathetically resolution
                        introduced by Mexican delegation. We accept principle that underlies it,
                        which we understand to be that while those powers which were enabled to make
                        greatest contribution to victory have right of initiative with respect to
                        peace terms, this is a right which ought to be used affirmatively and
                        constructively, and if not so used, consequences are of concern to all
                        members of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. In other words, larger powers
                        have not only right but responsibility and if they do not adequately
                        discharge that responsibility, others are entitled to concern themselves
                        with that fact.</p>
                    <p>With that principle, as I say, we are in accord. We do not intend to discuss
                        resolution as though it were technical directive. That would only
                        precipitate in this Assembly acrimonious disputes. I recall that first
                        meeting of Council of Foreign Ministers in London broke down primarily
                        because one of five participants wished to eliminate two of five from
                        further participation in treaty drafting then under way. I recall that in
                        Moscow in 1947 nearly two days were consumed by insistence of one power that
                        a state not a member of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should be
                        entitled to participate in drafting peace treaties. I take it we do not want
                        that kind of discussion here, and we assume that is not purpose of
                        resolution. Rather it is to record solemn concern of all of <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in early conclusion of peace treaties.
                        Government of US recognizes legitimacy of that concern and we pledge
                        ourselves to renewed efforts which are sought by Mexican Resolution.”</p>

                        <p>Dr. Tsiang called on me yesterday afternoon and, among other questions,
                            raised the matter of seats on the Security Council. He strongly urged
                            the desirability of India having a place on the Security Council. In
                            this connection he noted the threat of unrest and of Communistic
                            activities based upon that unrest, and felt it important that everything
                            possible should be done to build up the Indian government. He recognized
                            the problem of supplanting a Latin American state, an Arab state, or a
                            Western European state. He thought that if India remained in the British
                            Commonwealth, that consideration could be given to having India succeed
                            Canada, but he hoped that a way could be found to get India on the
                            Council this fall. He admitted that particularly with the Palestine
                            question still active, the Arab states would make a strong effort to
                            retain their representation. As a long-range proposition, he suggested
                            that the allocation of seats might be considered in four-term groups.
                            Under this system, the Latin Americans would be entitled to two seats on
                            the Council every three out of four terms, but for the fourth term,
                            would have only one seat which could then be allocated to some other
                            state. A similar system might be applied, in his opinion, to
                            representation from the Arab states. In general, Dr. Tsiang stressed the
                            importance of the emerging states of Asia and the bases for giving them
                            added representation in the Security Council.</p>

                            we were able to get a clearer idea than we have previously had about the

                            future.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me to be important for us to decide how far we should try to
                            push our views as to the adequacy of the Geographic Office candidates
                            from the organizational rather than the political point of view. It is
                            natural and proper for them to think in terms of satisfying their
                            clients and electing strong supporters of the United States to the
                            Councils. On our side I think we ought at least to raise for higher
                            authority the organizational considerations involved, particularly since
                            they may well be the determining factors in switching the election one
                            way or another. I have in mind particularly the mistake we made in
                            opposing the election of the Ukraine to the Security Council last year.
                            While this was defensible on political grounds, it did violence to
                            organizational practice (geographic balance). I think it will be agreed
                            that we should, if possible, avoid such a situation in the future.</p>
                        <p>As the attached list of Council members and candidates shows, we will be
                            confronted this year with a tendency to support the concentration of
                            Council seats in the hands of a few middle powers, thus creating a <hi
                                rend="italic">quasi</hi> monopoly for them in the Councils which in
                            my opinion is sure to be distasteful to the smaller countries. I call

                                <item>The Belgians tell us that the five Western Union Powers will
                                    caucus around July 20 and that Belgium is anxious to have the
                                    Netherlands succeed her on the Security Council. Our support is
                                    asked. <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> proposes to state, in
                                    substance, that the Netherlands would be our first choice for
                                    election provided it could be elected. From the organizational
                                    point of view, we in <gloss target="#t_UNP1">UNP</gloss> feel
                                    that support for the Netherlands would be unfortunate. The
                                    Netherlands served a one-year term on the Security Council
                                    ending December 31, 1946, and Belgium was elected to replace
                                    her. Now Belgium’s term on the Security Council is <pb n="100"
                                        xml:id="pg_100" facs="0120"/>expiring, while the
                                    Netherlands’ term on <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>
                                    also expires. The two countries apparently envisage a switch
                                    from Council to Council. We think that the implication that
                                    Belgium and the Netherlands between them should monopolize a
                                    Security Council seat is unfortunate and should be opposed. We
                                    feel that Norway would be a much more satisfactory candidate.

                                    Council at the end of last year and ought not to be re-elected
                                    so soon. She was elected to <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"

                                    will expire simultaneously in 1950. It seems to me that the

                                    Brazil on the Security Council simultaneously and that we would
                                    do better to look about for another Latin American

                                    she continues to hold for another year. I see no ground on which

                                    whose terms expire this year, five apparently desire
                                    re-election, while the sixth—the Netherlands—will apparently
                                    stand for the Security Council. I see no reason why Peru and
                                    Chile should be re-elected, particularly the former, whose
                                    contribution to <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> has
                                    been virtually nil. China and France, as great powers, are
                                    undoubtedly entitled to re-election. The situation as regards
                                    Canada is perhaps more difficult. Canada will continue to be on
                                    the Security Council for another year, and Australia and New
                                    Zealand will continue to be on <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"

                                    is overrepresented on <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>
                                    but feels we ought to support Canada for re-election, perhaps
                                    with an understanding that we would replace New Zealand next
                                    year with a Non-Commonwealth State. While I am conscious of
                                    Canada’s political and economic importance to us and to the
                                    world, I feel that it is a mistake to re-elect any but the Big

                                >Deptel</gloss> 379, August 4). Since Norwegians feel that by
                            process of elimination only nations likely to be “eligible” from west or
                            north Europe are Norway and Sweden, it is intended Foreign Minister

                            September 10. Norwegians foresee difficulties may arise in reserving
                            seat for area since they do not expect Arab League willing to see India

                                    Russian-supported Ukraine. Although this support evoked a strong
                                    favorable reaction in India and contiguous countries at the
                                    time, there were elements in India, less friendly to the United
                                    States, which contended that the United States was not
                                    supporting India out of sympathy for India but as a result of
                                    power politics and opposition to a Russian satellite. To fail to

                                    give credence to these charges and instigate a series of attacks
                                    on “American lack of principles” among the ever-ready Indian

                                    not only anxious to become a member of the Security Council but
                                    that failure on our part to support India’s candidacy would be
                                    detrimental to Indo-U.S. relations.</item>

                                    Russia would favor the Indian candidacy. Should Russia support
                                    this candidacy and the U.S. oppose it, a pro-Russian alteration
                                    might well occur in India’s already insufficiently clear

                                    of India toward the United States and other western democracies,
                                    and away from the USSR … and the progressive development of

                                    resources, and physical size India is preeminently qualified to
                                    be a member of the Security Council of the United Nations. Thus,
                                    it would certainly not be inappropriate for India to be elected
                                    to one of the non-permanent seats at this time—or for the United
                                    States to be one of the Great Powers supporting India. In this
                                    connection it should be borne in mind that China is already
                                    pledged to India and that it would be difficult to imagine that
                                    the British will not favor India over all other

                        <p>Dept considers Norway best qualified candidate this area with Denmark as
                            less satisfactory alternative. Dept understands Netherlands not a

                            this phrase suggests importance of state’s ability to make material

                        <p>239. From Ambassador Wilson. I came to Istanbul yesterday en route US
                            expecting see Foreign Minister who has been here few days and inquire of
                            him frankly re Sarper request for support Turkish candidacy <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> seat (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1"
                                >Deptel</gloss> 426, August 9 to Ankara); Sadak however is ill with
                            pneumonia. I therefore requested Perkins in Ankara see Secretary General
                            Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>Perkins now advises Secretary General states Turk Government definitely
                            decided would like seek <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> seat but could
                            not say Sarper in requesting US support was acting under specific
                            instructions to that end; he was rather exploring lay of land to see
                            what possibilities might be.</p>
                        <p>In view foregoing I suggest that in reply to Sarper our <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> delegation explain to him frankly and
                            fully present trend our thinking in matter and specific reasons which
                            may make it seem desirable to us support India. This should result
                            either in Turks dropping their candidacy and going along with us or else
                            in maintaining candidacy and making firm request for our support. If
                            latter case develops then <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0129"/>I
                            strongly urge we support Turks as failure to do so after firm request
                            might well cause misunderstanding and prejudice present most friendly
                            cooperative relations. [Wilson.]</p>

                                Secretary-General of the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
                                Telegram 1248 not printed. It stated the Department’s opposition to
                                a Luxembourg candidacy for election to the Security Council
                                    (501.<gloss target="#t_BC1">BC</gloss>/8–1848).</note> He felt
                            unable give formal opinion without consulting Spaak but in view delay
                            caused by waiting until September I pressed for his informal views.</p>
                        <p>He first points out Dutch attitude seems based on feeling their problems
                            will be better presented by nations other than their own. In developing
                            their case in Indonesia for example De Gruben understands Dutch consider
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> reaction would be more favorable
                            if no Dutch member were seated thereon. He admits this not wholly
                            convincing reason and suggests further that new Dutch Foreign Minister
                            might also plead inability find suitable personality for <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> seat. Agrees these reasons may not stand
                            up and concedes Dutch might accept if urged further.</p>
                        <p>De Gruben also expresses doubt as whether it will be possible
                            indefinitely to continue northern or western state membership <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> pointing out actually this restricted
                            seat to Belgium, Holland, Norway and Denmark—he omits Sweden
                            deliberately. Precedent thus established might easily be resisted by
                            other area groups and he wonders if it is wise make strong play for such
                            continuity.</p>
                        <p>As to Luxembourg he has heard of no approaches and wonders first of all
                            whether Luxembourg would actually accept to be named. He recalls limited
                            personnel available and doubts if Bech would feel willing undergo such
                            long absences from Luxembourg. As to size etc. under article 23 again De
                            Gruben feels considerable doubt concerning wisdom advancing candidacy
                            Luxembourg and for reasons set forth your paragraph 3.</p>
                        <p>Norway he thinks preferable to Denmark by reason of her active
                            participation in war on side western powers as contrasted completely
                            negative role Denmark plus same objections your paragraph 3.</p>

                            Dept has following comments re de Gruben’s observations. Normally Neth
                            might well be considered best qualified candidate. Under present
                            circumstances, however, Dept questions whether it would really be to her
                            best interests to stand, and if she stood if she could be elected. Hence
                            Dept believes any suggestions possibility Neth candidacy should be
                            discreetly discouraged.</p>
                        <p>Dept surprised de Gruben’s comment re possibility area giving up seat.
                            Dept feels under present circumstances would not be desirable for area
                            and not in U.S. interests. We had thought all Western and Northern
                            European states shared this opinion. Even staff member Swedish Del New
                            York spoke strongly on it to US Del.</p>
                        <p>If possible obtain more official statement Bel attitude prior Spaak’s
                            return would be most helpful to Dept.</p>

                        <p>Mr. van Kleffens said he had come in to talk with me about the
                            forthcoming choice of a successor to Belgium on the Security Council.
                            His Government had been canvassing the situation and had not found a
                            satisfactory solution. The most likely place to look was among the
                            Scandinavian countries but these had in the last two or three years
                            adopted a vacillating attitude and shown a disposal to throw tidbits to
                            the Soviet Union to offset any actions favoring the Western Powers, so
                            that on the whole a choice of one of these was regarded at The Hague as
                            possibly more favorable to the Soviets than to the Western Powers. His
                            experience with the Norwegian delegate on <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                                >ECOSOC</gloss> confirmed this estimate. He mentioned India as a
                            candidate but thought it had troubles enough of its own and would not
                            make a desirable <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0132"/>replacement.
                            He mentioned Turkey as subject to many pressures which would be
                            aggravated if it held a seat on the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>,
                            and Greece was too weak. The Netherlands was not going to put forward a
                            claim for the position or seek it in any way. However, if other nations
                            desired it to have the seat, it would accept.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. van Kleffens that the subject had not come to my attention. I
                            talked with Dean Rusk on the telephone to get some background, after
                            which I told the Ambassador that we had been studying the matter but had
                            not come to a decision. Our primary objective would be to retain the
                            seat for a Western European power. Our preference would be the
                            Netherlands, but the brief investigation we had made indicated
                            objections by other countries on the ground that it was a too rapid
                            return of the same power which had held the seat before Belgium; also,
                            the Indonesian problem would be a factor. It was suggested that
                            opposition to the Netherlands might arise from an ill-assorted group of
                            Latin American, Moslem, and Eastern European states which might combine
                            to put India into the vacancy. If it should be clear that the
                            Netherlands’ candidacy would not succeed, we had thought of Norway. Mr.
                            van Kleffens agreed that the seat must be held by a Western European
                            state and was sure that his Government would agree to some such state if
                            it became clear that the Netherlands could not be elected. He reiterated
                            his objections to Norway and mentioned that from the equitable viewpoint
                            Norway had been given many international offices whereas none had been
                            given to the Swedes or the Danes. I observed that since April Norway has
                            followed a commendable strong line. I told him that I would be glad to
                            discuss the matter further with Dean Rusk and then talk to him about it
                            the next time we meet.</p>

                        <p>I suggested in reply that it might be awkward for US among other states
                            to commit itself to supporting any Arab state for seat on <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> when knowing in advance that all Arab
                            states will strongly oppose admission Israel to <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> membership.</p>
                        <p>Jamali commented that “Arab states do not and cannot recognize existence
                            of such a state dominated as it is by terrorism and aggression.”</p>
                        <p>I asked if on basis statements made by his own Prime Minister it was not
                            fair to draw conclusion that if Israel be admitted to <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> by two-thirds vote GAUN Iraq would urge
                            all Arab states withdraw from <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Jamali answered that “in any decision on this point it would have to be
                            by collective decision of states members of Arab League and this could
                            not transpire unless and until Arab states should come to conclusion
                            that principles of Charter had been irreparably violated.”</p>
                        <p>Surely, he added, no more effective action could be taken to restore Arab
                            confidence in <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss> than for US and other
                            powers to proceed on assumption that no ground will exist for such
                            ultimate decision by Arab League and consequently as in the past to
                            elect Arab states to <gloss target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss> positions, thus
                            enabling them continue play role as constructive members that
                            organization.</p>
                        <p>I gathered clear impression that Jamali personally did not believe Arab
                            states would agree “collectively” to withdrawal from <gloss
                                target="#t_UNO1">UNO</gloss>. He made particular point of saying
                            that when assuming his new functions he had urged and found Regent and
                            Prime Minister favorably inclined towards early action in pursuance of
                            Tigris–Euphrates development <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0134"
                            />master planning discussed with World Bank last fall. This, he felt,
                            should be made Iraq’s major policy irrespective of political or military
                            developments in Palestine.</p>
                        <p>He commented that Arab states had lost heavily during latest phase of
                            Palestine dispute. Consequently they should strengthen themselves and
                            their international position for next phase which would probably be
                            dominated by world tension. In that order of ideas Iraq’s fate and
                            future lay in and with Anglo-American cooperation.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Denis Allen, Counselor, of the British Embassy, called this morning
                            at his request to discuss the following three matters:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of the first two items.]</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">

                        <p>Mr. Allen then read from a telegram from the Foreign Office instructing
                            the Embassy to ask the United States if we will agree to support Evatt
                            for the presidency. The telegram stated that the British had now made a
                            definite decision to support him and have so told him. The telegram
                            indicated that Evatt had asked the British to approach us in an effort
                            to get their support. The Foreign Office also requested the Embassy to
                            ask if we would be willing to campaign for Evatt in Latin America and
                            that, if so, they would proceed to instruct their Latin American
                            Missions to concert with ours in approaching Latin American states on
                            this question.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. Allen that I would raise this matter in the Department in the
                            light of his instructions but that he in effect already knew our general
                            thinking on the question of Evatt’s candidacy. I said that I thought
                            there was almost no possibility whatsoever that we would be willing to
                            campaign in Latin America as suggested.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Dendramis said that he wished to consult me regarding the
                            possibility of obtaining for Greece the seat on the Security Council
                            which will be vacated by Syria at the end of this year. He said that
                            Greece believed it could obtain the support of some of the Latin
                            American countries, some of the Arab states, and probably Turkey. If it
                            could also obtain the support of the United States and one or two other
                            great powers, it would seek election to the Council. However, the Greek
                            Government did not wish to take any step without being assured of the
                            approval of the United States and he therefore wished to get our
                            informal reaction to the idea.</p>
                        <p>I said that, speaking frankly, I could tell him we had received a number
                            of requests of this kind and so far had merely been noting them while
                            deferring any decision until a little later. I had not consulted anyone
                            in the Department regarding the Greek request and <pb n="117"
                                xml:id="pg_117" facs="0137"/>was not prepared to give a definite
                            answer at this moment. Speaking offhand and for myself alone, my first
                            reaction was that it might be an embarrassment to Greece to be part of
                            the Security Council at a time when she was a party to an important case
                            before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. I did not know whether any
                            state had ever been elected to the Council in such circumstances, and it
                            might not necessarily be an insuperable obstacle. Certainly Egypt and
                            the other Arab states were equally involved in cases now pending.
                            Nevertheless, as a practical matter it could be rather a disadvantage
                            rather than an advantage for Greece to be a Council member while her
                            case was actively under consideration. Mr. Jernegan pointed out, and I
                            agreed, that if Greece were a member of the Council, the eastern
                            European states, especially Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria, might be
                            even more intractable with respect to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> than they had shown themselves to be hitherto.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador emphasized that he was merely requesting our views for the
                            guidance of the Greek Government. If we were favorably disposed, Greece
                            would seek to persuade Turkey not to put forward its own candidacy but
                            to support Greece. If this were not possible, Greece would ask the
                            Turkish Government to give up its seat on the Economic and Social
                            Council in favor of Greece. Mr. Dendramis asserted in this connection
                            that a tradition had been established in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> whereby no one of the small nations was to hold a seat
                            on more than one of the major Councils at one time. In conclusion I
                            again told the Ambassador that I was not giving him a definite answer at
                            this time and that the Department would give further consideration to
                            the Greek interest in this matter.<note n="1" xml:id="d67fn1">In a

                        <p>2. The United States national group of the Permanent Court of
                            Arbitration, acting in accordance with Article 5 of the Statute of the
                            International Court of Justice, nominated four of the five retiring
                            judges: Hsu Mo (China); Badawi Pasha (Egypt); J. E. Read (Canada); and
                            Bogdan Winiarski (Poland). Since it could make only four nominations, it
                            is presumed that the four judges nominated were, in the opinion of the
                            panel, the best qualified.</p>
                        <p>3. It will be noted that the present geographic distribution of the Court
                            includes the five major powers, four Latin American states, two Western
                            European states, one British Dominion, two Eastern European states, and
                            one Near Eastern state. The choice of B. N. Rau (India), who is not an
                            international lawyer, is based both upon his other outstanding personal
                            qualifications (including the holding of high judicial offices in India)
                            and the desirability of having the Middle Eastern and Near Eastern area
                            more equitably represented on the Court.</p>
                        <p>4. The choice of the Yugoslav judge is based in part on the present
                            situation in Yugoslavia. It is not believed that the Polish candidate
                            has substantially better qualifications which would indicate his choice.
                            The second Eastern European judge has been dropped from the slate in the
                            interest of more equitable geographic distribution; none of the other
                            preferred United States candidates come from areas with disproportionate
                            representation on the Court.</p>

                            Jebb maintained the British position for a Slav and suggested

                                that a strong effort should be made to retain Belgium’s seat in
                                Western Europe and that Norway would be the best candidate. Doubt
                                was expressed about the possibility of electing the Netherlands and
                                Luxembourg was considered ineligible because of its size. Mr. Jebb
                                expressed some misgivings about Sweden. It was recognized by all
                                present that India might run a strong race for the seat being
                                vacated by Belgium and that considerable political work would be
                                required to avoid losing that seat from Western Europe. Jebb stated
                                that the United Kingdom had suggested both to India and Pakistan
                                that, in view of present conditions, they might wish to reconsider
                                the wisdom of standing for the Security Council this year.</item>

                            <item>No final conclusion was reached regarding the seat being vacated
                                by Syria. It was agreed that Turkey would be a suitable candidate
                                and that it should not be supposed that that seat was reserved for
                                an Arab State. Lack of agreement among Middle Eastern countries was
                                noted. With regard to the seat being vacated by Colombia, the
                                scarcity of good candidates was noted by all present. The idea that
                                this seat might revert to Brazil or Mexico received strong support
                                from both Mr. Jebb and the Canadians.</item>

                                stated that he assumed China and France would be reelected
                                “automatically” although <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0144"
                                />members of his staff reminded him that Canada did not consider the
                                reelection of the Big Five to the Economic and Social Council as an
                                automatic matter. The great interest of Latin American States in
                                membership in the Economic and Social Council was noted and it was
                                assumed there would be no dearth of candidates for the seats being
                                vacated by Chile and Peru. Mr. Pearson stated that Canada would not
                                refuse to serve if elected but that it did not wish to press its
                                candidacy. In any event, Canada did not wish to be in a position of
                                interfering with the election of India to the Economic and Social
                                Council, particularly if India were not elected to the Security
                                Council. To a lesser extent, Pearson indicated this might also apply
                                to Pakistan (Jebb indicated there was Pakistani interest). We
                                reaffirmed our feeling that we would like to see Canada continue to
                                be a member of the Economic and Social Council. Pearson concluded
                                this aspect of the discussion by stating that the question of
                                Canada’s position on this matter would be reviewed by their Cabinet
                                prior to the opening of the Assembly. After noting the possibility
                                of either Belgium or Sweden succeeding the Netherlands, Mr. Rusk
                                pointed out the possibility of reelecting Canada and then electing
                                India in place of the Netherlands, it was agreed that it would be
                                useful to consult India on this membership problem. When Jebb
                                mentioned Sweden as a suitable replacement for the Netherlands, we
                                commented that, while we felt Sweden was entirely qualified for this
                                post, we questioned whether this would be the right year for her
                                election as Denmark would continue on the Council.</item>

                                    inquiry, however, Mr. Jebb did state that the British were
                                    supporting Evatt in more than a nominal manner, bearing in mind
                                    considerations such as Commonwealth prestige . . . . There was
                                    complete agreement that Spaak was the most desirable candidate
                                    for the Chairmanship of Committee 1. At our suggestion the
                                    British promised to attempt to ascertain whether Spaak was in
                                    fact readily willing to take this assignment.” (Memorandum of

                            been receiving close attention Dept for several weeks. No conclusive
                            results as yet. Dept finds Jamali statement that Arab states desire Iraq
                            succeed Syria and his belief that most Near Eastern states are willing
                            to yield to an Arab state at variance with info received from other

                            support Turkey. Both Faris Bey and Fawzi Bey however have said within

                                >ECOSOC</gloss> there is no reason to support her for <gloss

                            Aug 30 on possible Greek candidacy. He maintained Greece had been
                            assured support several Arab and Latin American countries.</p>
                        <p>4. Prior to last 10-day period Dept had no indication that Arab states
                            were interested in obtaining <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> seat.
                            Accordingly Dept’s thinking until receipt <gloss target="#t_urtel1"
                                >urtel</gloss> 499 and info described above from New York had
                            centered on Turkey or India as possible successor to Syria with
                            preference toward Turkey for <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and India
                            for <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>. In light changing
                            developments matter will now have to be reviewed.</p>
                        <p>5. In general US would be disposed support candidate which had backing
                            majority states in area unless there were compelling political Reasons
                            to do otherwise. At present Dept is not able regard Iraq’s candidacy for
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> as favorably as that of Turkey or
                            India, particularly in light fact that contrary to what Jamali has told
                            you Iraq does not seem to have support Arab or regional non-Arab states.
                            Under present circumstances with Iraq on Trusteeship Council and in view
                            Iraq’s militant stand on Palestine question Dept would be less favorably
                            disposed to her candidacy than to others.</p>
                        <p>6. It is suggested you inform Jamali that US has not made up its mind
                            whom it will support. In general we have attempted support states who
                            have backing preponderance states in particular area.</p>

                            Latin American (Padilla Nervo) presided over Interim Committee, it would
                            not be appropriate to support a Latin American for President forthcoming
                            session.</p>
                        <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0147"/>
                        <p>Dept understands Evatt (Australia) and Arce (Argentina) are considering
                            offering themselves as candidates for <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>
                            Presidency. For reasons indicated above, we believe Latin American
                            States will agree that we should find a suitable candidate from outside
                            Latin America. Some doubt exists whether Evatt will actually continue to
                            press his candidacy or whether he would be elected, partly because of
                            some lack of enthusiasm about his handling of the <hi rend="italic">Ad

                        <p>Location of <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> in Paris has led us to feel
                            that French-speaking Western European might be most appropriate <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> President. We understand Spaak is
                            probably not available; Bech (Luxemburg) appears possibility; Chairman,
                            French Delegation (not yet designated) should not be ruled out of
                            consideration. In absence good French-speaking European candidate, Dept
                            inclined toward neutral attitude on <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>
                            Presidency. If Latin America and Western Europe are eliminated, we
                            believe there might be considerable interest in an Asiatic candidate;
                            thus far we have heard the names Tsiang, Romulo and Mrs. Pandit as
                            possibilities.</p>

                                [<hi rend="italic">25</hi>] and my telephone conversation with Rusk
                            today, have conferred with Ambassador Caffery regarding question of
                            French presidency of <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. Understand
                            Schuman definitely would not serve and French Government has no desire
                            for position. It is possible that if US presses hard, it might be
                            arranged that Marie<note n="1" xml:id="d75fn1">André Marie, French Prime

                            but in Ambassador’s opinion, because of French reluctance, this would
                            require considerable campaign <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0148"
                            />on our part to secure the appropriate support for Marie. In my
                            opinion, under these circumstances, it would be preferable to drop
                            attempt to secure French president and make best of bad bargain by
                            throwing full support behind Evatt thus obtaining as much of his good
                            will as possible. In view plans for discussions in Netherlands, Belgium
                            and Luxembourg, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, and with Evatt possibly
                            Monday in London, urgently request instructions on Department’s view.

                                    would support Spaak with whom Stikker conferred September 9
                                    Brussels. Stikker reported to us that Spaak planned to be in
                                    Paris during most of <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. Spaak
                                    still insisted that he is not at all a candidate but he would
                                    accept although he remarked that he might be equally useful from
                                    his <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0151"/>seat as a Belgian
                                    delegate. He could not promise to be in Paris every single day
                                    for three months but he could fly back and forth from time to
                                    time as situation in Brussels required. He stressed desirability
                                    of having suitable vice chairman of this committee who could
                                    serve if he were called back to Brussels suddenly during
                                    session. He mentioned MacEachen Uraguayan Ambassador at London
                                    and Freitas-Valle Brazilian Ambassador-designate to Spain as
                                    suitable candidates. We inquired his view regarding Padillo
                                    Nervo whom he thought acceptable but not as good as others.
                                    Spaak suggested Lange of Norway but agreed it would be difficult
                                    elect both chairman and vice chairman from west Europe. My
                                    impression is Spaak knowing the problem thoroughly and being
                                    honest with himself and with us would stay on job and believe he
                                    could carry out duties if called upon. If Department desires us
                                    follow this matter with delegates in Paris particularly those
                                    from Latin America, request instructions especially on vice

                                <item>De Beus on Thursday indicated Netherlands receptive to
                                    securing Belgium’s seat on <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and
                                    very doubtful whether Norway would be suitable in view of its

                                    frankly indicating their need for support in the <gloss

                                    Van Royen who had just reached Hague and who had not seen
                                    Stikker before joining us in our conference with him developed
                                    this theme in Stikker’s presence saying that Dutch considered
                                    obtaining this seat “a matter of first national importance”.
                                    From angle of national import he with Stikker’s concurrence
                                    stressed reliance on Belgium hitherto in <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                        >SC</gloss> on Indonesian question and reiterated doubts
                                    concerning Norwegian attitude. From international standpoint
                                    they stressed the doubtful character of reliance on Norway on
                                    any issues. We stated our reasons for favoring Norway but
                                    indicated we had not reached final decision. We pointed out
                                    objections in other delegations to giving a semi-permanent seat
                                    to Belgium and Netherlands, and indicated possible drive by
                                    Middle East and Far East countries to secure Belgium’s seat for
                                    India unless strong west European candidate presented. Stikker
                                    said the Dutch would not press their candidacy if this would
                                    mean assisting India to get on or losing the seat to western
                                    Europe. Stikker closed on this point by saying it was squarely
                                    up to US to decide whether Netherlands should receive the seat.
                                    Spaak said he would be embarrassed if Dutch are candidates and
                                    he was hardly in position to advise them not to seek the seat.
                                    Spaak recognized force of our arguments but also <pb n="132"
                                        xml:id="pg_132" facs="0152"/>indicated it was up to US to
                                    make the decision. He himself aside from Dutch complication
                                    leans towards Norway and did not himself express the fears which
                                    Dutch had voiced concerning Norwegian stand. Regarding Syria’s
                                    seat Spaak thought that India and Pakistan might alternate on
                                        <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> and <gloss

                                    definitely asked for US support for Belgium this year. He had
                                    heard that we were favoring Sweden and thought that if Norway

                            3 p. m. Evatt, as a preliminary, intimated that from what he had heard

                            reasonable.</p>

                                <item>he could, if he wanted to, say that he understood that as

                        <p>Evatt said that he appreciated this statement of our attitude which he
                            thought satisfactory and reasonable. He thought the greatest danger was
                            that the Latin American states, caucusing tomorrow, might unexpectedly
                            agree to back a Latin American candidate and get for him the support of
                            the Arab bloc and the Soviet bloc. He hoped that if the United States as
                            I indicated, was against this, we would make our influence felt for the
                            Monday caucus as afterwards might be too late as was the case last
                            year.</p>

                        <p>I telephoned Cordier this morning to check with him on latest information
                            on above subject.</p>

                                <item>He told me Evatt has the inside track clearly for the
                                    Presidency. The Latin Americans were talking about a candidate
                                    but he did not see that they had strength enough even in their
                                    own ranks to put one over.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Cordier said Spaak clearly is out in front for the
                                    Chairmanship of Committee 1. I raised with Cordier the question
                                    of whether the Latin Americans might not make a strong drive for
                                    this Chairmanship if they conceded to Evatt on the Presidency.
                                    Cordier thought that they could not muster enough strength.
                                    Furthermore, he went on, the Latin American Delegation list was
                                    pathetic. They had very few strong people. He mentioned Santa
                                    Cruz, Nervo, Stolk and Muniz as being probably the strongest on
                                    the list he had seen so far.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Cordier said he thought it would be essential to give one
                                    Vice-Presidency at least to an Eastern European and one to a
                                    Latin American. He said it would be essential to give three
                                    General Committee posts to the Latin Americans; this would mean
                                    one Vice-Presidency and two Committee Chairmanships. It would
                                    also be essential to give a total of three General Committee
                                    posts to Eastern Europe. In addition to the U.S.S.R. this would
                                    mean one Vice-Presidency and one Committee Chairmanship.</item>

                                <item>I informed Cordier that Romulo had asked our support for one
                                    of the Vice-Presidencies and we had informed him we would
                                    support him.</item>

                                <item>I told Cordier that we tentatively had Entezam or Malik on the
                                    list for Committee 3. He thought either of these would be
                                    good.</item>
                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>I told Cordier we favored Wilgress for Committee 5. Cordier
                                    said he thought Wilgress would be good for this but he had not
                                    been able to find out if he would be available. I told him I
                                    understood that the Canadians had informed Dean Rusk that they
                                    would make Wilgress available for this post.</item>
                                <label>7.</label>
                                <item>I said we tentatively were considering an Eastern European for
                                    Committee 6. Cordier said he thought this might work and
                                    mentioned the name of Vilfan.</item>
                            </list>

                        <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0155"/>
                        <p>I told Cordier that we definitely did not want to get into the business
                            of campaigning. We felt, however, that coordination was very important
                            and that he might well be, in our opinion, the most neutral and
                            objective coordinating center. With this in mind, I said we would try to
                            keep him fully informed of our views and any information we might pick
                            up. Cordier said that he would welcome this cooperation and thought that
                            we should continue exchanging views and work toward a general
                            crystallization of a firm slate before the elections get underway.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Fernandez stated that he had come to see Secretary Marshall.
                            He was, however, glad to transmit his message to Mr. Dulles in the
                            absence of the Secretary. He stated that he represented the Latin
                            American Delegation who, this morning, had a two hour session
                            together.</p>
                        <p>The caucus decided that the participants would support a French candidate
                            for the presidency of the Assembly if one were put forward by the French
                            Delegation. Lacking a French candidate they would support Señor
                            Bramuglia of Argentina. The latter decision was made after Señor
                            Bramuglia had said that he thought it would be better not to have a
                            Latin American president, but the Brazilian Foreign Minister, Fernandes,
                            made a strong speech in which he advocated the candidacy of Bramuglia,
                            and this resulted in the aforementioned decision.</p>
                        <p>If Señor Bramuglia’s candidacy does not seem to be succeeding, the Latin
                            American countries, in the interest of harmony, will vote for Mr. Evatt
                            of Australia . . . .</p>
                        <p>A committee composed of the representatives of Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
                            Ecuador, Peru and Cuba was formed to consult the other Delegates to the
                            Assembly. The Chilean was commissioned to inform the United States
                            Delegation and the French Delegation of the results of the caucus. The
                            Argentina representative will talk to the Arabs. There will be a meeting
                            of this committee at 6:30 this evening in the room of Señor Bramuglia at
                            the Hotel Prince of Wales. Afterwards there will be a plenary meeting of
                            the Latin American Delegates.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Dulles told Señor Fernandez that the United States, although it does
                            not oppose any Latin American candidate from a personal point of view,
                            feels it would be better if someone other than a Latin American were
                            elected president of this Assembly. He stated that the United States
                            Delegation would vote for Mr. Evatt of Australia.</p>
                        <p>Señor Fernandez then went on to say that the Chilean Chancellory would
                            like to have United States support in obtaining one of the following
                            posts in order of preference: <list>

                        <p>2. Upon the conclusion of the elections for Committee chairmen, M. Spaak,
                            supported by Sir Hartley Shawcross of the United Kingdom, suggested that
                            the meeting be adjourned in order to give delegates time for
                            consultations with regard to the election of the seven vice-presidents,
                            in accordance with the terms of Rule 27 of the Rules of Procedure, which
                            states that “the vice-presidents shall be elected, after the election of
                            the chairmen of the six main committees … on the basis of insuring the
                            representative character of the General Committee”.</p>
                        <p>3. The seven members of the General Committee elected on September 21
                            include two representatives of the British Commonwealth, two Latin
                            Americans, two Near and Middle Eastern representatives, and one western
                            European. In accordance with the usual practice, the <pb n="137"
                                xml:id="pg_137" facs="0157"/>United States would be expected at the
                            next plenary session to vote for the principal delegates of the Five
                            Major Powers as vice-presidents. The Delegation has also been committed
                            to vote for Romulo (Philippines) and Mr. Padilla Nervo (Mexico) as the
                            sixth and seventh vice-presidents. The objective of the Spaak-Shawcross
                            maneuver of postponing the election of the vice-presidents is to secure
                            one vice-presidency for an eastern European state in addition to the
                            Soviet Union. This is desirable because the eastern European bloc, which
                            originally held three seats on the General Committee, is now in danger
                            of being reduced to a single seat. If this should occur, the eastern
                            bloc might claim that it is being pushed out of active participation in
                            the direction of General Assembly affairs.</p>
                        <p>4. The United States has been planning for a General Committee in which
                            the Soviet Union and an additional eastern European state would be
                            represented. The Delegation voted for the candidate of Eastern Europe,
                            (Prochazka of Czechoslovakia) for the chairmanship of Committee VI.
                            Although we are committed to Padilla Nervo, M. Spaak has undertaken to
                            determine whether we cannot be released from our commitment to Padilla
                            Nervo for the vice-presidency in order to find a place for an eastern
                            European state. This would reduce the Latin American representation on
                            the General Committee to two seats. M. Spaak will apparently attempt to
                            convince Padilla Nervo that he should run for the vice-chairmanship of
                            Committee I rather than for a vice-presidency, in order that active
                            control of that Committee may be in good hands while M. Spaak is absent
                            from Paris.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi> That the Delegation honor its
                            commitments to Messrs. Romulo and Padilla Nervo unless M. Spaak succeeds
                            in securing a release from one of those commitments, presumably the
                            commitment to Padilla Nervo. In this case, however, the Delegation would
                            support an eastern European candidate for the last remaining
                            vice-presidency.</p>

                            (Mr. Rusk)</p>
                        <p>After noting the generally successful (from the standpoint of the United
                            States) results of the elections on September 21, Mr. Rusk explained
                            that the seven vice presidents of the Assembly remained to be elected.
                            Normally the Five Major Powers were elected as a matter of course, and
                            the United States had already committed itself to vote for Romulo
                            (Philippine Republic) and Padilla Nervo (Mexico) for the two remaining
                            vice-presidencies. Since the Assembly had failed <pb n="140"
                                xml:id="pg_140" facs="0160"/>to elect an Eastern European chairman
                            of Committee VI, if the election of vice-presidents followed the United
                            States slate above, the USSR alone would have a seat on the General
                            Committee. It was noted that the Soviet group claimed three seats on the
                            General Committee and that in the past it has not had fewer than two.
                            Mr. Rusk said that Malik (USSR) had been told that we had supported the
                            Czech candidate for the chairmanship of Committee VI. He explained
                            further that the motion by Spaak for adjournment of the session
                            yesterday was based on the hope of working out further representation
                            for the Eastern European group on the General Committee. M. Spaak
                            planned to approach Padilla Nervo and ask him to become a candidate for
                            vice-chairman of Committee I, a post in which he would have considerable
                            important work to do since Spaak, chairman, will not be able to remain
                            in Paris continuously. Mr. Rusk said the present recommendation of the
                            staff was to the effect that we should not break our commitments to vote
                            for Romulo and Padilla Nervo but should let Spaak handle the situation.
                            If he were unsuccessful, then we would simply vote in accordance with
                            our commitments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dulles said he had a telephone call from Denver in which concern has
                            been expressed regarding the results of the elections yesterday. He
                            thought the present situation might hold serious psychological danger
                            and be subject to unfortunate interpretations. Mr. Thorp noted that a
                            similar situation had come up in <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                                >ECOSOC</gloss> at its last session when the Eastern European group
                            lost some seats in the elections for the functional commissions and the
                            Soviet representative then immediately charged the United States with
                            lobbying against the Eastern European states when, in fact, the United
                            State had done no lobbying at all; the Delegation should accordingly be
                            prepared to face such a charge at the Assembly if the Eastern European
                            candidate were defeated. Mr. Jessup said that he had told Malik (USSR)
                            that we had favored the Eastern European candidate for Committee VI;
                            that we had previously made commitments to two candidates for
                            vice-presidencies in the expectation that an Eastern European state
                            would be elected a committee chairman; and that it would be necessary to
                            review the whole situation during the postponement. Mr. McKeever
                            suggested that it might be possible to forestall any attack on the
                            United States by simply telling the press that we had voted for the
                            Czech candidate for Chairman of Committee VI and also who our candidates
                            for vice-presidents are.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rusk suggested that it might be appropriate for the United States to
                            indicate to Padilla Nervo its sympathy with Spaak’s pro-proposal that he
                            accept the vice chairmanship of Committee I and withdraw his candidacy
                            for vice president. Mr. Raynor also favored <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141"
                                facs="0161"/>an approach by the United States to Padilla Nervo along
                            this line. Mr. Rusk noted that of course, if the votes on the first
                            ballot were scattered, the United States could consider dropping Romulo
                            from its slate.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Austin explained that he had told Katz-Suchy (Poland) that we
                            had voted for the Czech candidate for chairman of Committee VI, and that
                            the Delegation had commitments respecting the vice presidences which
                            would have to be reviewed in the light of developments after the
                            adjournment. The Secretary agreed that it would be appropriate to tell
                            the press and other delegations that we had supported a Czech for
                            Committee VI but questioned whether anything should be said regarding
                            our candidates for vice-presidents.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Thorp proposed that on the first ballot for vice president the United
                            States vote not for itself, since its election is certain in any case,
                            but for an Eastern European candidate. This would have the effect of
                            ensuring enough votes for an Eastern European candidate to guarantee its
                            inclusion on the next ballot, at which time the Delegation should review
                            the situation. Mr. Cohen agreed with this suggestion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dulles asked what limited the number of vice presidents to seven and
                            wondered whether there was anything worth exploring, perhaps looking
                            toward an increase in the number of vice presidents. It was explained
                            that the number of vice presidents was established in the Assembly rules
                            of procedure. Mr. Dulles suggested that if the Eastern European
                            candidate loses in the election of vice presidents, the United States
                            might move an amendment to the rules of procedure to increase the number
                            of vice presidents. He believed that the United States might simply ask
                            for a suspension of the rules of procedure to provide for the election
                            of a third vice president from Eastern Europe. It was noted that the
                            rules of procedure could be amended by a majority decision. Mr. Austin
                            pointed out that as a parlimentary body the Assembly controlled its own
                            procedure and could always act by unanimous consent; he therefore
                            suggested that the rules might be suspended and the third vice president
                            elected by unanimous consent. Mr. Cohen agreed that, if there were no
                            objection, the Assembly could proceed in this manner by a suspension of
                            the rules of procedure. Mr. Rusk noted that the rules of procedure did
                            not mention action by unanimous consent.</p>
                        <p>Returning to Mr. McKeever’s suggestion, Dr. Corrigan stated that he
                            believed there would be unfortunate reactions among the Latin American
                            Delegations if we were to announce publicly that we had not supported
                            Alfaro (Panama) for chairman of Committee VI. He did not think enough
                            was to be gained by the contrary strategy of <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142"
                                facs="0162"/>appeasing the Eastern Europeans by making public our
                            support for the Czech candidate to balance the danger to Latin American
                            good will. Mr. Rusk, however, noted it was more dangerous not to have it
                            known that we actually voted for an Eastern European state for this
                            post. Mr. McKeever asked whether he could tell the press, when
                            questioned, exactly how the United States had voted for each post and it
                            was agreed that he should give such information to the press. The
                            Secretary stated the Delegation’s agreement that the press should be
                            informed of our support for the Czech candidate for Committee VI but
                            that no information be given out regarding our preferred candidates for
                            vice presidents until further information was available.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Jessup suggested that we might start pushing the idea that the
                            Interim Committee should study the whole question of voting procedures
                            in the Assembly in order to work out the means by which difficulties,
                            such as the present one, could be avoided in the future. Such an
                            approach might soothe feelings. Mr. Rusk agreed that this might be
                            useful but noted that it probably should not be made as a statement to
                            the press, even without attribution, suggesting that members of the
                            Delegation might simply discuss the idea generally, and let it leak out
                            thus informally. Mr. McKeever noted that it would be important to show
                            that the same problem had arisen in other organs of the United Nations.
                            Mr. Jessup pointed out that the real drawback was that the Soviet group
                            was boycotting the Interim Committee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rusk noted the Delegation’s agreement to support Spaak’s approach to
                            Padilla Nervo. A final decision would then be taken in the light of
                            discussions of delegates after further conversations with Mr. Spaak just
                            as the Assembly convened.<note n="1" xml:id="d88fn1">For the proceedings

                            on the slates for the two Councils before the Delegation left the United
                            States. The final position of the Delegation would therefore <pb n="143"
                                xml:id="pg_143" facs="0163"/>have to be formulated in the light of
                            the developments in Paris.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Security Council</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Popper stated that it had been decided in connection with the
                            consideration of a candidate to replace Belgium, that it was of first
                            importance to retain this Council seat for a Western European state. The
                            United States had approached Norway, which it regarded as the most
                            eligible state and Norway had consented to campaign for election. It
                            could therefore be considered that the Delegation was committed to
                            support Norway for this seat.</p>
                        <p>As regards the successor to Colombia, Mr. Popper informed the Delegation
                            that, while Brazil was willing to be a candidate, it would not campaign
                            actively for itself. There was no information as to the preferred
                            candidate of the Latin American states. Cuba had indicated its interest
                            in standing for election. Mr. Popper suggested that the Delegation
                            should consider whether it should initiate a real campaign for Brazil or
                            simply await the decision of the Latin American caucus on a preferred
                            candidate. The staff recommendation would be to indicate to other
                            Delegations that the United States favors Brazil but will follow the
                            decision of the Latin American caucus. Mr. Rusk noted that Ambassador
                            Johnson, in Rio de Janeiro, had made it clear that Brazil would not be
                            an active candidate.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Corrigan said that the liaison officers for the Latin American
                            republics would prefer Peru and, as a second choice Ecuador, where
                            elections had recently been held, a strong government established, and
                            it was known that there was an outstanding individual available for
                            service on the Council. Ambassador Sayre asked what objections there
                            were to Peru, and Dr. Corrigan said he would strongly favor its
                            candidacy.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked about Cuba’s candidacy.… Dr. Corrigan thought it
                            would be necessary to find out first how much support Cuba has obtained.
                            Mr. Rusk believed that it would be important to sound out all the Latin
                            American states as to their preferred candidate and then support their
                            candidate if at all possible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Raynor referred to the selection of a state to replace Belgium. He
                            stated that the Netherlands had announced its candidacy and had frankly
                            stated that its desire for election was based on the hope that in the
                            Council it might be able to protect itself in the Indonesian situation.
                            The Department had attempted to discourage the candidacy of the
                            Netherlands, both because it had previously served a term on the
                            Security Council and because of its present involvement in Indonesia. He
                            believed special efforts should be made now to discourage its candidacy.
                            Ambassador Austin asked whether, if the Netherlands were defeated by
                            Norway, it would attempt to campaign against Turkey for the seat now
                            held by Syria. It was thought that it would <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144"
                                facs="0164"/>not. The Secretary asked whether the United States
                            Delegation should not defer its decision on the Netherlands until it saw
                            what support it had obtained. Mr. Raynor said that he believed the
                            United States should attempt to discourage the Netherlands’ candidacy
                            immediately. Mr. Ross noted that the Netherlands’ representatives knew
                            that the United States took a dim view of its ambitions in this
                            regard.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the question of a replacement for Syria, Mr. Popper explained
                            that India had apparently withdrawn from the contest. Both Egypt and
                            Turkey remained active candidates. Egypt was said to have the support of
                            the Arab League. He raised the question whether the United States should
                            support an Arab state at this time both because the election of an Arab
                            state might tend to establish further the idea that one Council seat was
                            reserved for a member of the Arab League, and because the Arab states
                            were so deeply involved in the problem of Palestine. He explained that
                            the Department had tentatively favored Turkey. Mr. Ross, while
                            indicating his agreement that this seat should not be reserved
                            permanently for an Arab state, believed that, in the light of the
                            present situation in Palestine, the United States should not oppose the
                            election of an Arab state, if one were an active candidate. Mr. Villard
                            agreed. Ambassador Austin asked what the British position was and Mr.
                            Popper said the British had indicated a preference for Turkey. Mr. Ross
                            noted that, chiefly because of the principle involved in electing
                            another Arab state to replace Syria, the French were favoring Turkey.
                            Mr. Jessup thought it would be desirable to know the thinking of the
                            Eastern European states on this matter. Mr. Villard thought it was
                            certain that the Soviets would strongly oppose Turkey. Mr. Rusk believed
                            it would be a very serious matter if three Arab states were elected in a
                            row to the Security Council: first Egypt, then Syria, and now Egypt
                            again; more information was needed on the views of the other Moslem and
                            Middle-Eastern states on this matter. It was noted that states such as
                            Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Liberia, Iran, Turkey, Pakistan and India would
                            never have an opportunity to sit on the Council if an Arab state were
                            always elected. The Secretary thought it would be best to attempt to
                            clarify the situation by obtaining the views of other states before
                            making a final decision. He recalled the circumstances of a conversation
                            which he had with the Egyptian representative in Washington, at which
                            time the Egyptian candidacy had been put forward, and pointed out that
                            he had made no commitment to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) <hi rend="italic">The Economic and Social
                                Council</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Popper explained that six members of the Economic and Social Council
                            were retiring. It could be expected that France and China <pb n="145"
                                xml:id="pg_145" facs="0165"/>would be reelected in accordance with
                            the informal understanding that the five major powers should always be
                            represented on this Council. The staff would recommend that the United
                            States support these two countries for reelection.</p>
                        <p>Chile and Peru were the two retiring Latin American members. Mr. Popper
                            explained that both these states were anxious to be elected and that in
                            addition the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Haiti and Bolivia were also
                            interested in running for the Council. It had been thought that the
                            United States should probably follow the decision of the Latin American
                            caucus.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Thorp asked whether members of the Delegation should not openly
                            indicate to other delegations that we liked the idea of rotation of
                            members on the Economic and Social Council.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired whether there had been any members reelected in
                            the past and Mr. Stinebower explained that no Latin American state had
                            ever been reelected. Mr. Stinebower wondered whether since Brazil was a
                            member of the Council, if it should be elected to the Security Council,
                            it might not be asked to resign to make way for another Latin American
                            state. In his opinion, this would be a disaster since Brazil was one of
                            the most useful members of the Council. It was thought that this problem
                            need not be met now and was unlikely to arise.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Canada, also retiring from the Council, Mr. Popper
                            indicated that the Department had initially favored its reelection, but
                            Canada had now stated that it would not be a candidate. The
                            recommendation, therefore, would be to support India to replace Canada,
                            with the understanding that Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar would be the Indian
                            representative on the Council. The Secretary noted that Madame Pandit
                            had asked to see him and asked what reply he should make to her if she
                            requested the support of the United States for India’s candidacy. Mr.
                            Popper thought it would he appropriate to say that we would support
                            India, with the understanding that Mudaliar would be its representative.
                            Mr. Jessup said that if Madame Pandit should raise the question of
                            Hyderabad, the Secretary might want to follow the same line he (Jessup)
                            had previously taken with the Indians, that it would be desirable for
                            India to take the initiative in requesting United Nations observers for
                            the scheduled elections in Hyderabad.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Thorp asked whether it would be possible to defer any final
                            commitments to India until he had had an opportunity to talk with other
                            representatives. He pointed out that India was in a difficult economic
                                <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0166"/>situation, that it was
                            under-developed, that it was pressing for high tariffs quite contrary to
                            our own international economic policies, and that there were already too
                            many states on the Council in a similar economic position. The effect
                            upon the work of the Council particularly worried him because the Middle
                            East and Far East were already well represented. He personally had
                            favored Canada’s reelection, and hoped final decision on this seat could
                            be postponed. He doubted whether it was possible to depend on the
                            assurance that any particular representative would be named to represent
                            India. He personally would hesitate to rely on such a commitment since
                            previously Mudaliar was the designated representative, but young Nehru
                            had actually attended. …</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that, in the light of the discussion, he believed
                            the Delegation was in agreement that no commitment should be made to
                            India, at this time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Popper explained that the Department favored Belgium to replace the
                            Netherlands on the Council. There were no other Western European
                            candidates. This was agreed.</p>

                        <p>I spoke quite frankly with Dr. van Roijen with respect to the
                            Netherlands’ candidacy for the Security Council along the line that
                            normally the Netherlands would, in all likelihood, be our preferred
                            choice. I said, however, that after the most careful consideration we
                            had concluded that because of Indonesia there would doubtless be a solid
                            adverse Asiatic vote which plus an adverse Slav vote would in itself
                            almost, insure defeat. I said the result of the defeat would mean that
                            western and northern Europe would lose this Security Council seat, and
                            that this was something which the United States did not wish to see
                            happen. I told Dr. van Roijen that the United States Delegation had
                            discussed this matter, and viewed the question seriously. I appealed to
                            Dr. van Roijen to bring these considerations to the attention of his
                            Government, and to urge; that they view the situation from the <pb
                                n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0167"/>larger view of the interests of
                            western and northern Europe instead of from a nationalistic view.</p>
                        <p>Dr. van Roijen stated that his Government’s decision had been made prior
                            to knowledge on its part that Norway would stand for membership. He said
                            that he thought there would be little difficulty in withdrawing their
                            candidacy under the circumstances which I had outlined. He added,
                            however, that they had some doubts as to how Norway would stand on
                            questions such as the Indonesian question, although they appreciated
                            that on matters pertaining to the Western Union they were now all right.
                            He promised to bring this question to the attention of his
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>In concluding our conversation, I stressed the danger of the Netherlands’
                            standing even on the first ballot, with a resultant scattering of votes
                            which well might eliminate both the Netherlands and Norway on the very
                            first ballot.</p>

                        <p>At the request of Mr. Blaisdell, Mr. Popper explained that it had seemed
                            appropriate to discuss briefly with the Delegation the recent and
                            rapidly changing developments on slates. The Political Liaison Officers
                            directly concerned were in a position to summarize the situation in
                            their respective areas and he would, therefore, ask them to report
                            directly to the Delegation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Raynor said that he had talked with Van Royen about the Netherlands
                            candidacy and thought it was quite possible that it might withdraw from
                            the race for the Security Council. He noted that the British
                            Commonwealth states opposed Egypt to replace Syria. Loridan (Belgium)
                            had also advised him that Belgium favored Costa du Rels (Bolivia) and
                            Sarper (Turkey) for vice chairman and <hi rend="italic">Rapporteur</hi>
                            respectively, of Committee I. Mr. Ross commented that Beeley (UK) had
                            informed him that he had been authorized by the British Delegation to
                            inform the Middle Eastern States that the British had not yet decided
                            what candidate should be supported to replace Syria but would be
                            strongly influenced in their choice by a collectively agreed upon
                            candidate.</p>
                        <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0168"/>
                        <p>Mr. Villard explained that Turkey and Egypt were having conversations on
                            their respective candidacies, but that no conclusion had been reached.
                            There was no question but what the Arab League was supporting Egypt.
                            Turkey was not actively campaigning, but if the United State indicated
                            strong support, and asked it to campaign, Turkey would probably make a
                            real election effort. In any event, some conclusion would probably be
                            reached by Monday.</p>
                        <p>He noted that India was greatly interested in election to the Economic
                            and Social Council and was actively campaigning. Although it had no
                            tangible support as yet, he believed it would be worthwhile from the
                            American point of view if India got a seat on the Economic and Social
                            Council. Its orientation with the West had grown in the past year and
                            its election would encourage it to take an even stronger line in our
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Corrigan reported that Ambassador Belt (Cuba) is claiming that Cuba
                            has 39 votes for its candidacy for the Security Council, including the
                            UK, and all of the Latin American states except Chile and Nicaragua upon
                            whose votes he felt he could not depend. Brazil would be a candidate at
                            the request of the Five Major Powers. Mr. Ross indicated that his
                            information was that the UK was not committed to Cuba.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Blaisdell explained that it had been thought desirable to discuss
                            briefly with the Delegation the latest developments on candidates for
                            the Security Council. He would ask the chief political officers to
                            discuss the situation in their respective areas.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Corrigan informed the Delegation that Ambassador Belt (Cuba) had told
                            him he had commitments for enough votes so that Cuba’s election was
                            certain. Belt had indicated that, although Argentina had suggested the
                            possibility of making a deal with the U.S.S.R. in exchange for the
                            support of the Soviet bloc, he had refused. Dr. Corrigan thought, with
                            these developments, perhaps the United State should support Cuba. The
                            Secretary asked whether there was any reason <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149"
                                facs="0169"/>why Belt should not be told that the United States
                            would vote for Cuba. Mr. Jessup observed that, in terms of the effective
                            functioning of the Security Council, it would be better to have Brazil
                            or Mexico. On the other hand, there was a question whether the United
                            States should attempt to drum up support for either of these states. Mr.
                            Ross noted that the British oppose Cuba on the ground that it is not
                            qualified for Security Council membership under Article 23 of the
                            Charter.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that a lot of time had passed during which
                            there had been no new developments on other candidates. He thought it
                            was possible under these circumstances that the United States might end
                            up without getting what it wanted and at the same time ill will would be
                            created. Mr. Dulles believed the United States should support Cuba,
                            pointing out that if it endeavors to interfere in the choice of the
                            Latin American states, it will be running counter to its usual policy of
                            following the Latin American caucus. Mr. Rusk thought it would be
                            difficult for the United States to campaign for Brazil and Mexico, as,
                            in fact, such a step would commit us to a policy of rotating the Latin
                            American seat among a small number of states. Under these circumstances,
                            he favored Cuba.</p>
                        <p>Both Mr. Ross and Mr. Dulles, commenting on the Secretary’s remark that
                            inaction in this situation might create ill will, noted that Ambassador
                            Belt had told them that the United States was reported as having asked
                            Peru to run. Dr. Corrigan indicated that there was another meeting of
                            the Latin American caucus tomorrow, at which time the final decision
                            might be expected.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested it might be appropriate to tell Belt the United
                            States would follow the majority decision of the caucus. Mr. Gross
                            observed that such a step indirectly supported the bloc arrangements
                            which the Delegation had criticized previously. In this connection, Mr.
                            Thorp thought it was important for the United States to reserve the
                            right not to follow automatically in every case the selection of the
                            caucus. The Secretary said he was most concerned about probable ill will
                            from all sides directed against our action. Mr. Cohen, after commenting
                            that the United States previously followed the choice of the Latin
                            American states in the Council elections, thought it was probably
                            desirable to avoid any definite commitment to Cuba in the event that the
                            Latin American bloc had not made its final decision. The Secretary
                            observed that if the United States followed such a line, it would be
                            essential to make sure that the United States kept completely out of the
                            pre-election maneuvering.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Roosevelt asked whether there was no way in which, in preliminary
                            conversations, the United States might help the situation <pb n="150"
                                xml:id="pg_150" facs="0170"/>by guiding the course of developments
                            in the caucus. The Secretary replied that we had already indicated our
                            preference for Brazil and Mexico and probably had gone too far. Mr.
                            Jessup thought it would be important to point out to Belt, if it was
                            decided to postpone making the definite commitment, that the United
                            States was not supporting any other Latin American candidate.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary concluded that it was the sense of the Delegation that
                            Ambassador Belt should be informed as informally as possible that as
                            matters now stand, the United States is disposed to support Cuba, on the
                            understanding that it is simply going along with the majority of the
                            Latin American states.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Villard summarized the situation respecting candidates to replace
                            Syria. He was still hopeful that Turkey and Egypt might reach agreement
                            as to which should run, and noted that Turkey had even offered to toss a
                            coin, but Egypt had refused. He believed Egypt had greater support and
                            observed that the Turks were not putting on an active campaign. He
                            cautioned that if the United States does not support Egypt, it may
                            encounter difficulties on the Italian colonies and Palestine. In answer
                            to a question from the Secretary, Mr. Villard indicated he did not think
                            it was possible at this time to take a final decision on this seat.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Raynor reported that it seemed likely that the Netherlands would
                            withdraw its candidacy. He thought the United States should go ahead in
                            its campaign for Norway. This was agreed. Mr. Popper indicated that the
                            Latin American states have expressed interest in Norway’s candidacy
                            although they have not committed themselves. It was noted that Norway is
                            not making an active campaign. The Secretary suggested that it would be
                            appropriate to consult with the British on this situation and see
                            exactly what they were doing in connection with Norway’s campaign.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Popper explained that there would probably be a plenary session of
                            the Assembly Friday, at which the Council elections would be <pb n="151"
                                xml:id="pg_151" facs="0171"/>scheduled. For this reason certain
                            preparatory work would have to be undertaken immediately, and it was
                            thought desirable to review the situation with the Delegation.</p>
                        <p>On the Security Council, he noted that no opposition had developed to
                            Norway’s candidacy, although Norway was not actively campaigning. In
                            accordance with Secretary’s request at a previous Delegation meeting,
                            the British had been asked whether they would campaign actively for
                            Norway. Mr. Raynor stated that the British had taken no campaign action
                            for Norway to date.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the Latin American candidate, Mr. Popper asked Dr. Corrigan to
                            bring the Delegation up to date on the discussions in the Latin American
                            caucus. Dr. Corrigan explained that Cuba’s candidacy had been confirmed
                            by the caucus. On the Economic and Social Council, Chile had made a
                            strong plea for reelection on the special ground that if it were not
                            reelected, the implication would be that it had been repudiated because
                            of its strong policy toward the U.S.S.R. The caucus had voted (12 votes
                            for Chile and 10 votes for Peru) to support both states for reelection
                            to the Economic and Social Council. Mr. Popper pointed out that the
                            reelection of these two states, along with China and France, might be
                            organizationally undesirable, particularly because it gave the
                            impression that the Economic and Social Council was a closed
                            corporation. However, it would be necessary to support Chile and Peru
                            unless the United States was prepared to depart from its previous policy
                            of accepting the agreed candidates of the Latin American states. Mr.
                            Thorp believed the United States was bound to support Chile in view of
                            Santa Cruz’s strategic position on Committee 2 and Committee 3. It was
                            agreed that, these two states should be supported for reelection.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Villard reported that the deadlock between Turkey and Egypt for the
                            Security Council still continued. Turkey claimed four votes and Egypt
                            eight from the states in the Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian areas.
                            There appeared to be no chance that Turkey and Egypt would agree. Mr.
                            Villard indicated that the British were in the same dilemma as the
                            United States; although the British Delegation favored Turkey a number
                            of the British experts on Middle Eastern affairs, who were keenly
                            conscious of Arab problems, favored Egypt. Mr. Villard expressed the
                            hope that the United States could agree with the British on a common
                            candidate from this area.</p>
                        <p>It was pointed out that if the United States continued to postpone
                            decision on this matter it would lose favor with both states. Mr. Ross
                            recommended that the United States support Egypt. He believed that there
                            was more to gain and less to lose by this step. The credit of the United
                            States was at a low ebb with the Egyptians. At the same time the failure
                            to support Turkey would be unlikely to damage United <pb n="152"
                                xml:id="pg_152" facs="0172"/>States-Turkish relations. Moreover, if
                            Egypt’s candidacy were opposed, it might affect the chances for a
                            settlement in Palestine. Mr. Ross believed we should tell the British
                            our views and try to persuade them to take the same line.</p>
                        <p>Emphasizing again that Egypt and Turkey had not succeeded in reaching an
                            agreement, Mr. Popper suggested that it would be better in the long run
                            if there could be an agreed candidate from the whole group of Middle
                            Eastern and Southeast Asian states. He proposed that the Delegations of
                            Turkey and Egypt be informed at this time that if they were unable to
                            agree, the United States would be forced to make its own choice. He
                            suggested that it might be unfortunate for Egypt to return again this
                            soon to the Security Council since it had immediately preceded
                            Syria.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cohen believed there was great strength in this point of view, and he
                            thought the Delegation should bear in mind the fact that the choice of
                            Egypt might build up a precedent to the effect that the Arab states
                            should at all times be represented on the Council. If the Arab states
                            insisted on an exclusive seat, it might create a demand for an increase
                            in the members of the Security Council which would present obvious
                            difficulties.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ross said that, while he agreed bascially with the organizational
                            desirability of passing Security Council seats around, in this case he
                            considered that political factors outweighed these adverse
                            considerations. He did not think that there was any danger that the Arab
                            states would insist that the single Security Council seat belonged to
                            them in perpetuity. In any event, he doubted whether in terms of
                            practical politics, they could maintain such a position. However, he
                            said he saw no objection to hold this matter over, preferably not later
                            than Tuesday morning, or at the latest, Wednesday, thus giving the two
                            contenders a final opportunity to reach a compromise.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Raynor thought there were some political reasons in favor of Turkey.
                            He pointed out that France and the Western European states preferred
                            Turkey. He thought their views should count in this situation. In
                            addition, one should not overlook the importance of having state on the
                            Security Council upon which the United States could depend; in this
                            connection, Turkey was certainly more reliable than Egypt. Mrs.
                            Roosevelt felt certain that the United States would get no support from
                            Egypt, particularly because Egypt was strongly anti-British at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Villard saw no objection to a further delay of 24 or 48 hours in
                            deciding upon the preferred candidate. He pointed out, however, that the
                            two states really could not be expected to reach an agreement and both
                            would be delighted if the United States made the decision.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gross referred to the earlier remarks as to the desirability of an
                            agreed candidate from the Middle Eastern bloc of states and <pb n="153"
                                xml:id="pg_153" facs="0173"/>thought there might be some advantage
                            in dividing the block. Mr. Popper saw the general objection to bloc
                            politics but emphasized that in elections there was the mechanical
                            problem of getting a two-thirds majority which necessitated lining up
                            support for candidates before an election. The whole problem was
                            facilitated if there were agreed candidates from a broad geographical
                            area. Nevertheless, Mr. Gross believed some of the bloc difficulties
                            arose from willingness to utilize blocs on organizational items, such as
                            elections. Their use there subsuquently deprived the United States of
                            the moral strength necessary to discourage on principle the use of bloc
                            techniques in committees.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cohen asked what position Pakistan and India had taken. He did not
                            think there was any objection to agreement between Middle Eastern states
                            on a common candidate since there was already the understanding that one
                            Security Council seat was to go to this group. He agreed, however, that
                            the development of blocs should not be encouraged. Mr. Villard indicated
                            that Pakistan, as a Moslem state, was supporting Egypt, while India
                            favored Turkey. Mr. Gross felt that from the standpoint of the interest
                            of the United States, there was a serious question whether Egypt’s
                            presence on the Security Council might not be extremely dangerous.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ross agreed that Turkey was a “surer bet” than Egypt. At the same
                            time our relations with Egypt were at a turning point. He believed that
                            it was a reasonably good gamble that Egypt’s election might swing it to
                            our side. The strongest evidence for this position lay in the fact that
                            the Egyptian government was not very stable. The people in Egypt who
                            were trying to promote a moderate policy on Palestine were those who
                            were anxious for Egypt to be elected to the Security Council. If Egypt
                            were not elected, it seemed likely that less moderate leaders would take
                            over the government, and United States-Egyptian relations would worsen.
                            Mr. Gross referred to the bad relations between Egypt and the United
                            Kingdom and thought that Egypt would probably continue in this policy
                            and would be likely to take any position, regardless of its merits,
                            which opposed the United Kingdom. Mr. Ross thought it was certain there
                            would be a deterioration in relations between the United Kingdom and
                            Egypt under existing circumstances. If Egypt were elected to the
                            Council, the situation might improve. Mr. Thorp thought his view
                            over-emphasized the importance of the election, which he believed was
                            only a minor factor in the total situation. Mr. Villard agreed, in
                            general, with Mr. Ross and noted that the United States had been able to
                            work more effectively with Egypt than any other Arab state because of
                            the moderate attitude of Fawzi Bey. Fawzi Bey would probably be the
                            Egyptian Security Council representative. Ambassador Austin pointed out
                            the importance of the personal factor in Security Council
                            proceedings.</p>
                        <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0174"/>
                        <p>Terminating discussion of this subject, Ambassador Austin indicated that
                            the Delegation would postpone final decision pending conversations with
                            representatives of Turkey and Egypt, in which it would be indicated that
                            the United States is about to make an independent decision on this
                            matter unless the two states can reach agreement.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Maktos explained that under Article 13 of the Charter the General
                            Assembly had responsibility for the codification and progressive
                            development of international law. It would be called upon to establish
                            an International Law Commission of 15 members who were to be experts in
                            international law and who would serve in their individual capacity,
                            rather than representatives of states. The slate combined not only
                            considerations of general geographical distribution and representation
                            of various systems of law, but at the same time placed primary emphasis
                            upon the individual qualifications of the candidates. Mr. Maktos then
                            read the list of candidates. Ambassador Austin inquired as to the
                            meaning of the secondary candidates and Mr. Maktos explained that, if
                            there were an impasse on the first ballot or if some of our candidates
                            made a bad showing, these were the alternative candidates to which the
                            delegation might shift its vote.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Sayre asked whether the candidates were chosen on the basis of
                            individual qualifications or on the basis of geographical distribution.
                            Mr. Maktos said that individual qualifications had come first, but
                            indicated that in the case of Prince Wan (Siam) geographical
                            distribution had been the deciding factor. Nevertheless, Prince Wan had
                            done considerable work in international law and was well liked. It was
                            noted that he had been elected Vice-Chairman of Commttee 6.</p>
                        <p>The slate was approved by the delegates without further comment.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Blaisdell explained that it was planned to hold the Council elections
                            at the Plenary Session of the Assembly tomorrow. It was therefore
                            necessary for the Delegation to come to a final decision on the
                            candidates. He asked Mr. Popper to report on the present situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Popper explained that the Delegation’s position was determined,
                            except with respect to one seat on the Security Council and one seat on
                            the Economic and Social Council. In the case of the Security Council a
                            choice had to be made between Turkey and Egypt, and there were
                            substantial reasons in favor of both candidates. Turkey would provide
                            dependable support for the United States on the Security Council, and
                            from an organizational point of view its election was perhaps preferable
                            since it had not served previously and since its choice would make clear
                            the principle that the Arab States do not enjoy an exclusive Security
                            Council seat to themselves. On the other hand, Egypt was very anxious to
                            serve, was the agreed candidate of the Arab League and would put an Arab
                            State on the Council, which might be helpful in connection with the
                            Palestine problem.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired whether it was thought that the election of Egypt
                            would be of positive benefit to the United States or would simply be a
                            preventive and purely defensive choice and asked specifically whether
                            the United States would gain something by voting for Egypt. Mr. Villard
                            replied that the United States could hope to work very well with Fawzi
                            Bey, the probable Egyptian Representative, <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158"
                                facs="0178"/>who had proved to be the easiest of the Arabs to deal
                            with on Palestine. In that situation he believed the choice of Egypt
                            would represent a positive gain for the United States. On the other
                            hand, Fawzi Bey would certainly vote in accordance with the interest of
                            all the Arab States and would never vote as we would wish on Palestine.
                            Mr. Villard noted that Egypt had only the support of the Arab
                            League.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked Mr. Jessup for his views. Mr. Jessup stated that, on
                            balance, he believed the United States should support Egypt on the first
                            ballot. It might gain some favor by this action, and in particular, it
                            might create a better atmosphere for the solution of the Palestine
                            problem and also the question of the disposition of the Italian
                            Colonies. He believed, as regarded other Security Council issues not
                            directly concerning the Arab States, Egypt would come along with the
                            United States in general, and it would only be on those questions where
                            the Arabs had a special interest that its position would be likely to
                            run counter to that of the United States. For these reasons he suggested
                            that the United States support Egypt on the first ballot but perhaps
                            shift to Turkey, depending upon developments.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Austin, basing his position on his Security Council
                            experience, believed Egypt could contribute to the work of the Council,
                            even though it would be opposed to the United States on many things. He
                            questioned whether it was wise to choose Turkey simply because it would
                            vote with the United States. He wanted the Delegation to cast its vote
                            on the basis of what would produce the most good and on that basis, he
                            was personally convinced that Egypt was the best candidate. Mrs.
                            Roosevelt indicated she had no way of choosing a preferred candidate in
                            this situation. Mr. Cohen said he would defer to the judgment of Mr.
                            Jessup and Ambassador Austin, although, on the basis of the arguments
                            put forward in Mr. Villard’s paper (US(P)/A/135) he would lean toward
                            Turkey. Ambassador Sayre said that he believed the strengthening of the
                            Security Council was the most important consideration in this case. He
                            did not think that the Palestine problem would be solved in the near
                            future nor that its solution would be facilitated by the election of
                            Egypt. He wondered whether the strengthening of the <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> was, therefore, not more important than
                            the possible political advantage of supporting Egypt. He thought Turkey
                            would be a stronger rod to lean on and for that reason, favored its
                            candidacy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gross asked what position the Soviet bloc was taking and Mr. Popper
                            indicated that there was no information on this point. Mr. Raynor
                            thought Turkey would certainly be opposed by the Soviet group. He
                            pointed out also that not only the British Commonwealth but also all the
                            Western European States favored Turkey. Mr. Rusk thought undue emphasis
                            had been placed upon the importance of the election in relation to
                            specific political issues. He pointed out that <pb n="159"
                                xml:id="pg_159" facs="0179"/>Egypt had already sat on the Security
                            Council and doubted that its choice would alter the general political
                            situation. He believed the United States should support Turkey.</p>
                        <p>While noting that weight should be given to the views of those working in
                            the Security Council, Mrs. Roosevelt said she felt there would be no
                            real security with Egypt, even though now and then it might vote with
                            the United States, because more often it would not work with the United
                            States. She thought Turkey a more reliable choice. Ambassador Austin
                            indicated that the situation balanced up closely on both candidates.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would hesitate not to follow the preference of the
                            United States Representatives in the Security Council, though personally
                            he preferred Turkey. Nevertheless, he would agree that the United States
                            should vote for Egypt on the first ballot. Ambassador Austin noted that
                            it would be possible to work well with either country, as both Sarper
                            (Turkey) and Fawzi Bey (Egypt), their respective representatives, would
                            be easy to work with. As for the problem of getting votes in the
                            Council, he commented that ordinarily the USSR drives the other states
                            on the Council to vote the opposite way in self-defense.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Jessup thought that it was almost a toss-up and Turkey would probably
                            be elected. He himself was a good deal impressed by the problem of
                            general relations between the United States and the Arab States, and
                            thought it would be helpful if we let the word get around that we are
                            backing Egypt. He did not think it would be bad for the United States if
                            Egypt were elected and proposed again that the United States vote for
                            Egypt on the first ballot. Mrs. Roosevelt wondered whether our position
                            with the Arabs would improve at all, unless we voted with them on
                            Palestine. Mr. Jessup thought we would not lose the entire world on the
                            Palestine issue and that the longer range problem of friendly
                            Arab-American relations was most important. Mrs. Roosevelt asked again
                            whether anything would really have the slightest influence, and Mr.
                            Jessup said he would defer to the Near Eastern experts on this
                            question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ross agreed fully with Mr. Jessup. The United States was always sure
                            of its credit with Turkey. Any positive gain in our relations with Egypt
                            would be an improvement. He favored supporting Egypt on the first
                            ballot.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that the Delegation would support Egypt on the first
                            ballot but would make no reference to its position on further ballots.
                            It should inform only Egypt, although the Secretary noted that Egypt
                            would undoubtedly spread the United States commitment around. This
                            raised the question as to when the Egyptians should be <pb n="160"
                                xml:id="pg_160" facs="0180"/>told of the Delegation’s decision. Mr.
                            Ross believed they should be told immediately. Mr. Jessup indicated that
                            the political officers would be under pressure as to how the United
                            States would vote and he thought it should be possible to tell all who
                            inquire that we are voting for Egypt on the first ballot. Mr. Rusk
                            suggested that we should make it clear that we would be glad to see
                            either Turkey or Egypt on the Council. The Secretary did not think this
                            was desirable, since it appeared to qualify our support and believed it
                            would be better simply to see what the situation was after the first
                            ballot. Mr. McKeever commented that if the Egyptians were told
                            immediately, the Delegation could expect to read in the morning papers
                            that the United State was supporting Egypt. For this reason he thought
                            it would be preferable to delay telling the Egyptians until after lunch.
                            The Secretary said he would leave the question of when the Egyptians
                            should be told up to Mr. Jessup. Mr. Jessup thought it would be all
                            right to wait until after lunch. The Secretary then indicated that if
                            Egypt failed on the first ballot, the United States would vote for
                            Turkey, but would not let that fact be publicized at this time lest it
                            result in bad feelings from both state.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the situation on the Economic and Social Council slate, Mr.
                            Thorp recalled that the Department had originally agreed on Canada for
                            re-election but that the Canadians had indicated that they would not
                            wish to run against India. However, Canada had once indicated that if
                            both Chile and Peru were supported for re-election it might change its
                            position. He was, himself, very much concerned about the effect of
                            India’s participation in the Council and referred to the fact that in
                            his first speech in Committee II, the Indian Representative had been
                            sharply critical of the metropolitan powers, in particular, in relation
                            to their participation on regional commissions, and had also charged the
                            exporting powers (the United States) with discriminating in favor of
                            Europe against Asia. He thought it would be desirable to check this
                            situation again with the Canadians although it might be too late to
                            shift our position. Mr. Raynor commented that he would be glad to check
                            with the Canadians but noted that it had been known for several days
                            that Chile and Peru would be supported for re-election and the Canadians
                            had not raised any questions. Mr. Rusk recalled that Mr. Hume Wrong had
                            called him in Washington shortly before he left to inform him that the
                            Canadian Cabinet had decided that Canada should not stand for
                            re-election and had asked that the United States not embarrass Canada by
                            supporting it. Mr. Thorp indicated that if Canada did not want the seat,
                            there was no question of supporting her. It was agreed that the
                            Delegation should support India.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Washington explained that Ambassador Muniz (Brazil) had asked that
                            the United States support Ambassador Amado for the ILC. Ambassador Amado
                            was now on the secondary United States slate. In view of the general
                            cooperation which the United States received from Brazil, Mr. Washington
                            suggested that the Delegation might wish to reconsider its previous
                            decision, approving the United States slate, and include Ambassador
                            Amado. On a question from the Secretary, Mr. Blaisdell explained that
                            the original slate had been chosen on the basis of personal competence,
                            and secondly, equitable geographical representation. He recommended that
                            the Delegation stand on its previous decision. Mr. Gross, referring to
                            the fact that the Brazilian request was tied up with another matter,
                            said he did not believe the United States should change its slate. … It
                            was agreed that the slate should not be changed and that the Brazilians
                            should be told that the United States had chosen the candidates which it
                            would support on the basis that they were the best men for the
                            posts.</p>

                                SD/A/198, September 2, <ref target="#pg_118">p. 118</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Gross explained that this item had been placed on the Delegation
                            agenda, not because immediate plenary action was anticipated, but
                            because it had become necessary to discuss our slate with other
                            delegations. The terms of five judges of the International Court would
                            expire. Two of these were Eastern Europeans. The question was whether
                            the Delegation should support the re-election of all five present
                            incumbents or shift its support to a Middle Eastern candidate for one of
                            the places. The latter was the recommendation in the position paper
                            before the Delegation. This position had been taken because of a feeling
                            that it would be generally desirable to increase the representation of
                            the Near and Middle Eastern states and on the feeling that on political
                            grounds it was appropriate to reduce the representation of the Eastern
                            European countries. The latter point Mr. Gross considered improper,
                            since the capacity of the individual candidate was actually the most
                            important criterion. It was for those reasons, however, that it had been
                            agreed to support Sir B. N. Rau (India) for election in the place of the
                            Polish incumbent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gross said that discussions with members of the British, Belgian, and
                            Dutch Delegations during the past few days had disclosed that these
                            countries felt it would be a great mistake to support another candidate
                            to replace one of the two Eastern European incumbents. It was argued
                            that such action would simply add fuel to the Soviet feeling about the
                            Court, in particular as to its non-representative character. <pb n="163"
                                xml:id="pg_163" facs="0183"/>He pointed out, however, that these
                            states did not believe that the re-election of the two Eastern European
                            judges would make the Soviets any more disposed to submit matters to the
                            Court.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gross recommended that the Delegation support the five present
                            incumbents for re-election. He pointed out that the Near East was
                            already represented on the Court by an Egyptian judge. In view of the
                            feeling of the Western European states and his own view that the slate
                            in the position paper had been largely motivated by political
                            considerations which were quite inappropriate in dealing with the Court,
                            he recommended again that the five incumbents be supported. He noted
                            that there was one complicating factor—a commitment might have been made
                            in Washington to support Sir B. N. Rau. He would want to know the
                            details on that matter, although he assumed that any commitment was
                            probably only for the first ballot. Miss Brown explained that a firm
                            commitment to support Sir B. N. Rau had, been made to the Indian
                            Ambassador in Washington, although the question whether the US would
                            support Rau beyond the first ballot had not been dealt with
                            specifically.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked that a telegram be sent to Washington asking for
                            precise information as to the views of the Department on this
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dulles thought there was no point in paying any attention to the
                            Soviet susceptibilities on this matter unless the USSR showed some
                            willingness to use the Court. In his view, if it intended to boycott the
                            Court in any case, there was no point in voting for Eastern European
                            judges. He called attention to the fact that the Soviet position has
                            consistently been against allowing any question to be referred to the
                            Court. Mr. Gross indicated that both Eastern European incumbents were
                            able jurists, and of course were not elected as representatives of
                            states. The British, Belgian, and Dutch Delegations fully understood the
                            point of view which Mr. Dulles had just expressed and were under no
                            illusions as to the Soviet opinion of the Court. Nevertheless, the
                            failure to support the two Eastern European incumbents would give the
                            Soviets an additional argument which would appeal to the public.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rusk pointed out that these were the first elections to the Court
                            since 1946. He thought it would be unfortunate to establish a possible
                            precedent that the judges should be automatically re-elected and
                            suggested some rotation was desirable, since otherwise, a judge once
                            elected would be entrenched in office almost indefinitely, and if his
                            removal should become necessary, it would be extremely difficult without
                            raising serious political questions. The Secretary commented that while
                            this was a valid point, re-electing all but one would not really meet
                                <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0184"/>the issue, and there was an
                            invidious implication if only one was left off the slate. Mr. Gross said
                            he did not consider that supporting the present incumbents should
                            constitute a precedent, and he believed the Delegation should make it
                            clear, if it adopted his recommendation, that it was not favoring a
                            principle of automatic succession.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Gross reviewed the consideration previously given to the
                            International Court of Justice slate by the Delegation, recalling that,
                            pending information from the Department as to the nature of the
                            commitments which had been made to Sir B. N. Rau (India), it had taken
                            no final position on his recommendation to alter the Department’s
                            position paper to support re-election of the five incumbent judges. He
                            said that the Department had now informed the Delegation that a firm
                            commitment had been given the Indian Ambassador on September 3, and he
                            had been told that his government could inform other governments that
                            the United State was supporting Rau. Mr. Gross noted that it was not
                            clear whether the United States was obligated to support Rau beyond the
                            first ballot. Mr. Kopper said he had been present at the interview with
                            the Indian Ambassador in Washington, who had been told that the United
                            States would give “reasonable” support to Rau’s candidacy. Pointing out
                            that India would not expect the United States to support Rail to the end
                            he observed that the United States would have discharged its commitment
                            if it shifted its vote after Rau fell far behind. Mr. Blaisdell called
                            the commitment indefinite, not being specifically limited to the first
                            ballot, nor being extended indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Austin interpreted the obligations of the Delegation as
                            requiring that it vote for Rau on the first ballot; if the vote were
                            close, to continue to support Rau; and if Rau fell far behind, to shift
                            the vote of the Delegation to another candidate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gross asked whether the commitment was simply to vote for Rau or to
                            talk to others in his behalf, Mr. Kopper said the Indian Ambassador had
                            been informed that the United States would not campaign for Rau but
                            would tell others, if asked, it was voting for <pb n="165"
                                xml:id="pg_165" facs="0185"/>him. Mr. Jessup pointed out that there
                            was a difference between saying that the United States was supporting
                            Rau on the first ballot and simply saying it was supporting Rau. Mr.
                            Rusk noted that Rau’s situation was no different in this regard from
                            that of any of the candidates.</p>
                        <p>After it was noted that the special British problem arose partly from the
                            fact that Sir Zafrullah Khan<note n="1" xml:id="d100fn1">Pakistani
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs and Commonwealth Relations and Chairman
                                of the Pakistani Delegation to the General Assembly.</note> was also
                            a candidate, the Delegation considered the probable developments in
                            voting strength arising out of the concurrent Security Council and
                            General Assembly balloting on the International Court of Justice
                            candidates. Mr. Jessup thought it very likely that the Polish incumbent
                            would get six votes on the first ballot making him the Security Council
                            preferred candidate. This development would probably be followed by a
                            corresponding shift in the Assembly vote.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dulles asked why the original commitment had been made to Rau. Mr.
                            Kopper explained that India had approached the United States on a number
                            of subjects, including its candidacy for the Security Council, the
                            Economic and Social Council and Rau’s candidacy for the International
                            Court of Justice.</p>
                        <p>General policy considerations had appeared to make it important to
                            support India in at least one of these cases and the Court place had
                            been chosen. Mr. Gross regretted that the Court selection had been put
                            on a political basis. Mr. Jessup noted there were political reasons for
                            voting for either the Polish incumbent or Rau. Mr. Gross thought there
                            was a difference in the case of the Pole, since he was already on the
                            Court.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cohen asked whether it would do violence to the United States
                            commitment if Rau was told simply that while the United States would
                            vote for him on the first ballot, unless he was in the lead it could not
                            continue to support him. He could also be told that the United States
                            believed it was important not to have the U.S.S.R. feel that Eastern
                            European representation on the Court was being deliberately reduced.
                            Even though the U.S.S.R. would not bring cases to the Court it was quite
                            possible that in the future there would be a greater tendency to seek
                            advisory opinions. Eastern European membership on the Court might make
                            some difference as to the weight these states attached to those
                            opinions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kopper pointed out that those considerations had been known last
                            summer. He did not think that the Indian Delegation would be sympathetic
                            to this approach. Mr. Cohen commented that it was not quite true that
                            the United States knew as much about the situation then, particularly
                            the Western European position. Mr. Thorp pointed out the United States
                            support of India’s candidacy for <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1"
                                >ECOSOC</gloss> had also altered circumstances.</p>
                        <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0186"/>
                        <p>Mr. Rusk said that when the original decision was made, both the United
                            Kingdom and Canada had indicated they were supporting Rau. Moreover, the
                            United States national group had nominated the Pole and not the
                            Yugoslav. However, the Department had decided for policy reasons to
                            support the Yugoslav. He wondered whether commitments to individuals
                            were not more flexible than commitments to countries.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Austin stated the agreement of the Delegation to support Rau
                            on the first ballot and on successive ballots unless he fell far behind.
                            If it became necessary for the United States to shift its vote he should
                            be informed in advance of the reasons. Mr. Cohen wondered how far ahead
                            the other candidates should be on the first ballot. Ambassador Austin
                            thought far enough to insure their election. It was pointed out that
                            since the Security Council and the General Assembly balloted
                            concurrently there might be different results in each. Mr. Dulles
                            thought the strategy to cover this situation could be decided upon only
                            after a decision as to the candidate which the United States wished to
                            see elected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sandifer recalled that he had taken part in the developments of the
                            present slate in the Department. It had been felt that Southeastern Asia
                            was not adequately represented on the Court and that Eastern Europe was
                            over-represented. On the point whether a commitment to an individual
                            involved less responsibility, he commented that on the basis of his own
                            experience in this Assembly session, the Indian orientation was
                            sympathetic to the United States; if the commitment were broken, there
                            would probably be serious repercussions, especially if a shift was made
                            before a decisive modification in the voting.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Austin said that if the Delegation believed Rau to be out of
                            the running as the result of the first ballot, the United States would
                            drop him from the slate. Otherwise it would continue to support him.</p>
                        <p>Commenting on Mr. Sandifer’s remark, Mr. Cohen expressed some doubt as to
                            whether Eastern Europe was actually over-represented. The Latin-American
                            states had certainly disproportionate representation. He did not think
                            the representation of Southeastern Asia was completely met by taking a
                            seat away from an area where other special political problems were
                                involved.<note n="2" xml:id="d100fn2">In several sittings meeting

                        <p>I called at Mr. Cordier’s office at about 12:45 to keep a luncheon
                            engagement. He had just come from Mr. Trygve Lie’s office where the
                            Secretary-General had been in consultation with Mr. Papanek, the
                            Czechoslovak Representative at the United Nations, for nearly an hour.
                            Cordier told me that their first understanding was that Papanek was
                            submitting his resignation as Czechoslovak Representative and he raised
                            with me the possibility of assisting him to find some academic position
                            in the United States. He was then called again into Mr. Lie’s office and
                            on coming out told me that Papanek had formally submitted, as the
                            accredited Czechoslovak Representative to the United Nations, a paper
                            asking that the Czech question be immediately brought before the
                            Security Council. I understood that he asked for consideration under
                            Article 34, but am not definite on this point. While we were discussing
                            this aspect of the question we were joined by Mr. Lie and Mr. A. H.
                            Feller. Mr. Lie said that Papanek insisted that he would fight any
                            attempt to cancel his credentials and would insist that any such orders
                            coming out of Prague were not issued by the Government of
                            Czechoslovakia. Mr. Lie told him that if he received new credentials for
                            someone else signed by Beneš<note n="4" xml:id="d103fn4">Eduard Beneš,
                                President of Czechoslovakia.</note> and Gottwald,<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d103fn5">Klement Gottwald, Czechoslovak Prime
                                Minister.</note> he could not do anything but receive them and place
                            them before the Security Council. It was indicated by one of the group
                            that the question would arise whether the United States would continue
                            to accord the diplomatic privileges to Papanek under such circumstances.
                            It further appeared that following the usual Secretariat procedure, Mr.
                            Lie had told Cordier to take Papanek’s paper immediately to
                                Sobolev,<note n="6" xml:id="d103fn6">Arkady A. Sobolev, Assistant
                                Secretary-General in charge of Security Council Affairs.</note>
                            which was done. The group, after Mr. Lie had left us to keep a luncheon
                            engagement, were agreed that Sobolev would undoubtedly telephone at once
                            to Gromyko<note n="7" xml:id="d103fn7">Andrei A. Gromyko, Permanent
                                Representative of the Soviet Union at the United Nations.</note> who
                            would in turn communicate with Moscow, with the likelihood that action
                            would come out of Prague terminating Papanek’s status within perhaps six
                            hours. Cordier and some of his staff and I went on to luncheon and
                            continued to discuss there the question of the role of the Secretariat
                            in connection with the recognition of a representative under these
                            circumstances. Cordier’s view seemed to be that the Secretariat could
                            not undertake to pass judgment in such a situation. At this point Mr.
                            Feller joined us in considerable <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0189"
                            />excitement, saying that Mr. Papanek was already holding a press
                            conference at which he was informing the press that he was laying the
                            matter before the Security Council. (I was subsequently told by a member
                            of the press that he made the direct charge that Masaryk<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d103fn8">Jan Masaryk, late Czechoslovak Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs.</note> had been murdered by the Russians.) Feller was
                            insistent that the Secretariat was bound to get Papanek’s paper
                            documented and distributed before his credentials could be cancelled.
                            They seemed to agree that when the paper was handed in, Papanek was the
                            accredited Representative of Czechoslovakia, and that his paper
                            therefore must be treated as an official paper. Cordier left the table
                            and telephoned Sobolev and came back and reported that Sobolev said that
                            he had to speak to Mr. Lie about something in the paper before he could
                            have it processed. Cordier had not been able to persuade him to the
                            contrary and I understood that Cordier and Feller were endeavoring to
                            reach Lie with a view to his directing Sobolev to proceed. No further
                            development occurred before I left the group at 2:10.</p>

                        <p>At Mr. Rusk’s request, I inquired of Mr. Feller whether he had written
                            any legal opinion for the Secretary-General regarding the validity of
                            Dr. Papanek’s credentials as Permanent Representative of Czechoslovakia
                            to the United Nations, or his qualification to submit his complaint
                            regarding events in Czechoslovakia to the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Feller said that events had moved too quickly for written legal
                            opinions on the previous day when the incident had occurred, but he had
                            discussed the matter with Mr. Lie on several occasions (See US/S/287).
                            The key to the Secretary-General’s ruling that Mr. Papanek’s
                            communication must be treated as a non-governmental one was Papanek’s
                            statement to the Secretary-General that he was submitting the document
                            in his personal capacity. Papanek made the same statement at his press
                            conference. Therefore, the Secretary-General felt that he must look
                            behind the outward appearance of the document and Papanek’s action in
                            submitting it to make an essentially political judgment that Papanek was
                            not acting as the Representative of Czechoslovakia but as an
                            individual.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Feller said that he had had to concur in this view of the
                            Secretary-General although it was his first belief that Papanek’s letter
                            should have been given standard treatment and his communication
                            submitted to the Security Council.</p>

                        <p>I called Mr. Cordier to inquire whether he had any information regarding
                            the status of the Czech credentials for Mr. Papanek or the newly
                            appointed representative, Houdek.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cordier told me that Mr. Papanek had called on him this morning, and
                            Mr. Cordier had then called Papanek to ask whether he cared to see Mr.
                            Houdek at the United Nations or at his office. Houdek had previously
                            agreed that he did not want to create any scenes or crises vis-à-vis
                            Papanek. Papaiiek said he did not want to see Mr. Houdek and added that
                            from his point of view he wanted to keep the record straight to the
                            effect that he had been accredited by Beneš and Masaryk and would
                            relinquish his post only on orders signed by Beneš. However, Papanek
                            said he did wish to avoid embarrassment. It was agreed that the two
                            gentlemen would not meet today or tomorrow (March 15 or 16), and during
                            that time Houdek would not attempt to go to the Czech Delegation
                            Office.</p>
                        <p>The official United Nations view on the credentials is that Houdek is the
                            accredited Czech representative. Mr. Cordier explained that the
                            Secretary-General must assume that the Czechoslovak Chargé<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d105fn1">Josef Hanc.</note> in Washington is in touch with
                            Prague and speaks authoritatively, and therefore, when he wired that
                            Houdek was replacing Papanek, the Secretary-General had to accept that
                            wire as a temporary accreditation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cordier said that, with the agreement of the Secretary-General, he
                            was personally keeping in touch with the situation. He said he would
                            keep us informed of developments.</p>

                            Clementis and Beneš. Clementis had said that neither Papanek nor Kerno
                            had held credentials signed by Beneš. The Czechs did not think such
                            credentials were necessary, but, without prejudice to the future, they
                            were sending credentials for Houdek signed by the President and himself.
                            Credentials Would arrive by mail.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary-General has now abandoned further attempts to inform
                            Papanek that his credentials have been superseded by those of Houdek,
                            since Papanek has refused on three occasions to accept such letters from
                            the Secretary-General.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Papanek spoke to me several times during this afternoon in the lounge
                            and in the corridors at Lake Success.</p>
                        <p>[Among other things, Mr. Raynor and Dr. Papanek discussed the proposal
                            that had just been presented to the Security Council that same day by
                            the Chilean member, to the effect that a sub-committee of the Security
                            Council should be appointed to hear “evidence, statements and
                            testimonies” concerning the situation in Czechoslovakia. This was the
                            second of two moves made by Chile regarding Czechoslovakia before the
                            Security Council in as many months. The first had been made in a
                            communication dated March 12, and resulted in placing the Czech item on
                            the agenda of the Security Council, by virtue of bringing before the
                            Security Council the allegations made in the aborted Papanek letter of
                            March 10, that the political independence of Czechoslovakia had been
                            violated by the threat of the use of force by the Soviet Union, and that
                            this situation endangered the maintenance of international peace and
                            security and should be brought to the attention of the Security Council.
                            On occasion, the United States seemed about to assume an active role in
                            the debate, and at meetings of the Security Council on April 6 and April
                            12, Ambassador Warren R. Austin, the United States Representative at the
                            United Nations, won Security Council approval of a resolution asking the
                            new Czech Government to participate without vote in the proceedings of
                            the Council regarding Czechoslovakia (the Czech Government in the event
                            declined to do so); and made a strong statement of some length (April
                            12) describing the events leading to the changes in the Czech
                            Government. (Regarding these <hi rend="italic">démarches</hi> by the

                            Czechoslovakia was before the Security Council in several forms during
                            March-May 1948, and is usefully described in general terms in United

                            Chilean proposal of April 12 by use of the “double veto”, that is, cast

                            without official notice of his dismissal. I made no comment. (I am told
                            by members of our Mission in New York that the only reason he has not
                            been advised of his replacement by his successor is the fact that he has
                            consistently refused to receive even registered letters from the United
                            Nations on this point.) I do not know what he thinks he is accomplishing
                            by this position. It may have something to do with funds. It is my
                            feeling that the next time I speak to him I better make it very clear
                            that insofar as we are concerned, we do not now regard him in any way as
                            the Czechoslovak representative inasmuch as we have received proper
                            papers concerning the appointment of his successor.</p>

                            that as stated above it is time most likely to achieve approval Ital

                            matter was put over pending Big Fire consultation. Argument would

                            once.</p>
                        <p>In discussions you should attempt to obtain definite and quick responses
                            to the following points: (1) Will country consulted go along with us?

                        </p>
                        <p>I detailed to Bathurst and Falla our position on Italian Membership. They
                            said they would send a telegram this afternoon to London putting forword
                            our suggestion.</p>
                        <p>Their personal reactions were that there were a great many technical
                            difficulties involved. They did not, for example, feel that the excuse
                            of the difference between the General Assembly resolutions on Italy and
                            Transjordan and the resolutions of the other five applicants was a very
                            strong argument for taking these two up separately. Bathurst suggested
                            that since that argument was flimsy we might as well be blunt about it
                            and try to take up Italy all by itself. He also pointed out that various
                            members of the Council might want to take up certain other applications
                            at the same time—for example Ireland and Portugal. He appeared to have
                            his mind open to the possibility that we might not make too much of an
                            issue of treating Transjordan and Italy alone. Both he and Falla thought
                            the time was very short and that this gave Gromyko all sorts of
                            opportunities to stall the decision up until very close to the election
                            and they agreed that it was essential that we be assured of sufficient
                            support to drive this through quickly before undertaking any moves.</p>
                        <p>In regard to Finland, they indicated they were certain the Foreign Office
                            was a good deal cooler on this application than previously. They
                            intimated that their position was that Finland was about to become a
                            Soviet Satellite and that they might therefore not be prepared to
                            support her application. They said they would let me know immediately
                            they received any reply from the Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I mentioned our position on the Burmese application
                            contained in the Department’s 134.<note n="1" xml:id="d110fn1">The
                                Mission was authorized to support Burma’s application when

                        <p>1073. Question of Italian application <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            membership (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 881, March 12, 6
                            p. m.) was discussed informally with Mason head of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Department Foreign Office and Crosthwaite
                            head of Western Department. <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0197"
                            />Both emphasized that they could not indicate official British position
                            until matters given close study.</p>
                        <p>Crosthwaite questioned certainty of propaganda advantage of raising
                            question at present time particularly if Soviets took full advantage of
                            weakness of case in singling out Transjordan and Italy from all other
                            applicants. He granted that outright Soviet veto might be useful
                            propaganda but said we must not underestimate Soviet ability to avoid
                            being maneuvered into the position we wanted to get them into or their
                            ability to make propaganda for their side if the thing got into a
                            muddle. Crosthwaite, however, was of personal opinion that on balance
                            “it was probably worth trying”.</p>
                        <p>Mason pointed out that in light of Assembly’s resolutions and Austin’s
                            letter of November 22, 1947 case for singling out applications of
                            Transjordan and Italy was somewhat specious one and probably bad
                            practice from point of view of long term good of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>. Also Great Britain would have to give some
                            consideration to bad effects of singling out Italy and Transjordan and
                            giving them preferential treatment over and above Portugal and Eire
                            whose cases had been pending longer and who had reasons to expect better
                            treatment from Great Britain. However, if political considerations in
                            present Italian situation were overruling he thought Great Britain would
                            want to go along with us in matter.</p>

                            said Belgium was, of course, in favor going along with US on Italy and
                            thought Russians would certainly veto Italian application which would
                            have favorable effect in Italy. He had also been informed our views from
                            New York. At first glance, matter seemed involve procedural questions
                            with which he was not familiar; he thought these should be carefully
                            considered to make sure that what we decide will not “backfire” on us.
                            He would consult his expert on subject. I urged him move quickly in
                            matter and requested he get in touch with me soon as he had anything to
                            convey.</p>

                        <p>21. My 20 March 15.<note n="1" xml:id="d119fn1">Not printed.</note> I am
                            officially advised today that Canadian Government agrees to admission of
                            Italy to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and believes question should
                            be raised in Security Council with least possible delay. The Canadian
                            representative will be instructed to support admission.</p>
                        <p>So far as other outstanding applications are concerned although in a few
                            weeks’ time Canadian Government may be willing to give Finland’s
                            application favorable consideration dependent on how current
                            negotiations between Soviets and Finland develop, it would not be
                            prepared at this time to support applications for membership by other
                            countries than Italy or Transjordan.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary for State [for External Affairs]<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d119fn2">Mr. Lester B. Pearson.</note> makes following
                            personal suggestion about a possible follow-up to a Soviet veto of
                            Italy’s application for membership: “That one of members of the Security
                            Council which has supported Italy’s admission might state in the Council
                            after a Soviet veto that it intends at the next session of General
                            Assembly to propose that Italy be given by Assembly all the rights and
                            privileges of membership in Assembly with exception of right to
                            vote.”</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary believes this proposal constitutional since under its own
                            charter it is master of its own procedure and has already extended to
                            Jewish Agency an unofficial body right to participate in discussions and
                            this it did with the support of the Soviet Union. Now in view of Under
                            Secretary if the Assembly can permit an unofficial body to participate
                            in its discussions it would seem to be reasonable to conclude that it
                            could permit a non-member state to participate. This non-member state
                            might be called an associate member since it <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181"
                                facs="0201"/>could not of course be called a member of Assembly. He
                            furthermore points out a decision to admit Italy as an associate member
                            of Assembly would require by two-thirds vote but he believes this might
                            be possible to secure. Such an admission of Italy as an associate member
                            would, Under Secretary agrees, establish a precedent for those nations
                            whose applications had been vetoed by the Security Council but he does
                            see danger in this and points out it would, for example enable Assembly
                            to admit Ireland as an associate member.</p>

                        <p>Sir John stated that Mr. Bevin and the Foreign Office had grave doubts as
                            to the desirability of our raising in the Security Council the question
                            of Italy’s application for United Nations membership. The British
                            considered that if the matter were raised in this way it would be
                            stigmatized as election propaganda by the Communists in Italy and would
                            thus lose much of its effectiveness. They also felt that the obvious
                            political character of the manoeuvre would injure still further the
                            prestige of the United Nations. They questioned particularly what they
                            understood to be our proposal not to consider the application of
                            Trans-Jordan along with that of Italy, pointing out that the special
                            stress on expeditious procedure with regard to these two applications
                            during the last General Assembly gave at least some legal coloration to
                            extraordinary consideration of the two applications together at this
                            time. Sir John also mentioned the possibility that the Soviets might
                            move for the consideration of all pending membership applications or
                            might revive their proposal for a deal involving the admission of Italy
                            and the Balkan Satellites. He suggested that, if we were determined to
                            proceed with the Italian application, we should delay action until some
                            time closer to the date of the Italian election, on the assumption that
                            the step might appear less blatantly propagandist if it did not
                            immediately follow the Trieste <hi rend="italic">démarche</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Sir John stated that the United Kingdom Delegation in New York had
                            reported that our delegation was planning to invite the Russians <pb
                                n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0203"/>Immediately to a consultation
                            on March 25, with a view to a Security Council meeting on the Italian
                            application on March 30.</p>
                        <p>By way of a preliminary reaction, Sir John was informed that in our view
                            there was a considerable advantage to be gained in Italy by taking the
                            initiative in this matter, particularly since the Russians might
                            otherwise do so. It was stated that any disadvantage which we might
                            suffer from bringing the matter up would be apparent not in Italy but
                            outside that country. It was our feeling that if the Soviets attempted
                            to link the admission of Italy with that of the Balkan Satellites,
                            Italian pride would be injured and our own position aided. There was,
                            furthermore, some possibility that the Soviets might not at this stage
                            veto the application.</p>
                        <p>We said that we were not aware that there had been any firm decision to
                            drop consideration of the Trans-Jordan application and indicated that we
                            would seek further information on this point.</p>
                        <p>As regards procedure, we suggested that it might be desirable to begin
                            the process of consultation at once but to delay actual discussion and a
                            vote in the Security Council for a period of about ten days. Sir John
                            appeared to favor a longer interval of perhaps two weeks before a vote
                            was taken. We also suggested that Sir John might wish to report our
                            comment as the Department’s preliminary reaction, but that we would make
                            a further check on the subject and would give him more definite
                            views.</p>

                            with Bidault yesterday, however, and he agreed to go along with us and

                            March 25, 2 p. m.). He said that he would like to give the question
                            further consideration but his first reaction was that it was too soon
                            now after the Trieste move to push the application. He said that
                            membership in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was no longer in the
                            minds of Italian public an essential prerequisite for betterment of
                            Italy’s position under the treaty as manifested by the move made <pb
                                n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0206"/>by the three nations with
                            respect to Trieste. He said also that the Italians generally were so
                            grateful for American initiative in the Trieste matter that a second
                            move for reconsideration of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership
                            was not necessary at least so soon after the other. He said he wished
                            his initial reactions to be considered entirely informal and rather in
                            the manner of a preliminary discussion of the question by him and that
                            we would have a further discussion on the subject when he had had more
                            time to think it through.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion this preliminary position should not cause us to abandon
                            the idea but rather to consider the timing of when it might be brought
                            up.</p>

                        <p>1386. Remytel 1360, March 26. When I saw Sforza yesterday at his request,
                            he informed me that he had given further thought to question of Italian
                            application for membership in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He said
                            that it was his considered opinion that it would be very helpful to
                            electoral situation here if Italian application for entry into <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> were pushed prior to elections. The main
                            consideration was of course matter of timing which should not be too
                            soon after Trieste move.</p>

                                vote to admit Italy to United Nations membership. France would not
                                raise the issue of admission of other states at this time, but if
                                this question were raised by some other state, France would vote in
                                favor of the admission of all states which have been considered to
                                date by the Security Council except for Bulgaria. France would
                                refuse to vote for Bulgaria because of the ‘murder’ of Petkov.

                                secretary-general of the Agrarian Party (leader), was executed after
                                Bulgarian trial on Sept. 23, 1947. The Department of State in a
                                press release of the same date labelled the trial and execution of
                                Petkov as a “travesty of justice”. This Government had made

                        <p>1706. Following Bidault’s agreement to go along with US in opposing the
                            admission to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> of all Soviet satellites
                            except Finland and his statement that appropriate instructions would be
                            sent to the French representative at Lake Success (my 1607, March 25) I
                            was informed on March 30 that there had been a modification in the
                            French position and that an instruction had been sent to Parodi to
                            oppose <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0208"/>Bulgaria’s admission but
                            only to abstain in the case of the other satellites.</p>
                        <p>I called on Bidault subsequently and told him that in view of his
                            previous assurances I failed to understand the reasons for a change in
                            the French position. He replied with great embarrassment stating that
                            subsequent to our conversation he had re-examined the question and had
                            modified his views because 1) in view of fact that French had previously
                            supported all satellite applications except Bulgaria a complete reversal
                            of their original position would appear “illogical”; 2) he believed that
                            French abstention would be just as effective from US point of view as a
                            direct vote against.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I could not agree with him and that in my opinion it was
                            illogical of the French to oppose Bulgaria’s admission because Petkof
                            had been hanged and to take a different position in regard to the other
                            satellite states which had similar regimes, which had committed similar
                            atrocities to the Petkof hanging and were all puppets of Moscow. I
                            expressed the hope he would stand by his March 24 statement to me.</p>
                        <p>Bidault promised to look into the matter again but he did not repeat his
                            earlier assurances.<note n="1" xml:id="d131fn1">In telegram 1711, April

                                in case of Austria as in past France and UK have been unwilling to

                        <p>398 [Daily Classified Summary No. 44.] Membership. At a private Big Five
                            meeting in <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> offices April 7, after
                            Austin noted the proposal to reconsider applications of Italy and
                            Transjordan, Gromyko (USSR) said the position of the Soviet Union was
                            well-known and had not been changed; he could not agree to the admission
                            of Italy without at the same time Bulgaria, Rumania, Hungary and Finland
                            being admitted. As far as Transjordan was concerned, Gromyko said the
                            USSR would be willing to vote favorably if Outer Mongolia and Albania
                            were also admitted.</p>
                        <p>Cadogan (UK), pointing out he had said many times earlier no state was
                            entitled to link its approval of one applicant with approval of any
                            other, said Gromyko’s position was based on an incorrect interpretation
                            of the Potsdam Declaration; that the Declaration was never intended to
                            bind signatories to admit ex-enemy states regardless of whether they had
                            committed an act of aggression, or some similar act.</p>
                        <p>Stating the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> had given the applications
                            of Italy and Transjordan a kind of priority, Tournelle (France) thought
                            it preferable for the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> to deal with
                            these two only. However, it was open to other states to ask for
                            additional applications to be placed on the provisional agenda. Gromyko
                            said the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> could not bind the <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Austin noted the Ukraine had requested that the applications of a number
                            of additional states be placed on the provisional agenda, and <pb
                                n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0211"/>he thought that, if this were
                            going to be done, the other states of Eire, Portugal and Austria should
                            also be considered by the council. Gromyko pointed out this depended
                            upon whether a state raised the matter formally.</p>
                        <p>Tsiang (China) hoped that Burma’s application, which had been approved by
                            the membership committee, would not be mixed with the others. Gromyko
                            and the others agreed.</p>

                        <p>After the Big Five meeting on Membership was over, we discussed tactics.
                            It was agreed that we should jointly propose Eire, Portugal and Austria
                            for the provisional agenda.<note n="1" xml:id="d136fn1">For text of this

                            Council meet on Friday and it was essential that final decision be taken
                            before the end of next week. It was agreed that we should take the
                            applications in the order in which they appeared in the letters
                            requesting that they be put on the agenda and that each application
                            should be discussed and voted on before the next one was considered.</p>
                        <p>We discussed the position we would take on the individual applications.
                            We stated we would prefer to vote No on Rumania, Bulgaria, Hungary,
                            Albania and Outer Mongolia and would do so if the French and British
                            would also do so.</p>
                        <p>Sir Alexander indicated he would have to look up his instructions. He
                            seemed to favor all acting alike.</p>
                        <p>M. de la Tournelle said his instructions were to vote No on Bulgaria and
                            to abstain on the others.</p>
                        <p>As to Finland, the British and French seemed to feel they would favor. We
                            said we had to get additional instructions on this question.</p>

                        <p>They are instructed to give priority to Italy and Trans-Jordan. As far as
                            the Austrian application is concerned, they are not to take the lead.
                            They do not wish Austria to be admitted before Italy or Eire. They hope
                            they will not be asked to do more than approve a resolution similar to
                            the Australian Resolution last fall. They will support such a
                            resolution. If there is a strong drift in the direction of supporting
                            Austria’s application without any reservation, they would support it
                            reluctantly, so as not to be left behind. They will join in voting
                            against Albania, Outer Mongolia, Rumania, Bulgaria and Hungary. On
                            Finland they will follow the United States lead. In any case, they will
                            abstain rather than vote against. On Italy they will make a strong
                            speech either after the U.S.S.R. has spoken in opposition to Italy or
                            perhaps after the Russians have vetoed Italy’s application.</p>

                        <p>200. Suggested statement to be made at opening discussion Ital membership
                            application follows:</p>
                        <p>McKeever should coordinate closely with Voice of America people N.Y. to
                            insure best possible coverage of statement Ital. Mission should also
                            work closely with Mascia this connection.</p>
                        <p>“The United States has consistently given its full support to the
                            application of Italy for admission into the United Nations. Today, I
                            have the honor to reaffirm the support of the United States for Italy’s
                            application.</p>
                        <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0213"/>
                        <p>Even before the ratification of the Treaty of Peace with Italy, the
                            United (States maintained that as a co-belligerent with the Allies from
                            1943 to 1945, and as a country which had made enormous strides forward
                            under heavy handicaps in her own postwar rehabilitation, Italy was
                            entitled to special consideration by this body of freedom-loving
                            nations. Indeed, this special position of Italy was recognized by my
                            Govt and the Govts of the United Kingdom and Soviet Union at Potsdam. A
                            special para on Italy was included in the agreed-upon communique issued
                            at the end of that meeting, and it was agreed that the preparation of a
                            peace treaty for Italy should be the first task of the Council of
                            Foreign Ministers. After the ratification of the peace treaty, no shadow
                            of an excuse remained for the persistent exclusion of Italy from
                            membership in the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>My Govt, together with the Govts of the U.K. and France, has requested
                            this renewed consideration of the Ital application. Speaking for my
                            Govt, this action is taken because we have the firm conviction that an
                            injustice has been done to Italy. This nation of 45 million people
                            meets, by any conceivable standard, the qualifications laid down in Art.
                            4 of the Charter concerning membership. This has not been questioned. My
                            Govt feels therefore that it should do everything within its power to
                            bring about a correction of this injustice. It believes this opinion is
                            shared not only by most of the members of this Council but by an
                            overwhelming majority of the total membership of the United Nations.
                            This was made abundantly clear in the resolution on Italy’s application
                            which was passed at the last meeting of the General Assembly. In the
                            opinion of my Govt the Security Council has not, thus far, given proper
                            weight to that resolution. True, it did meet briefly on the question
                            while the Assembly was still in session, but the members of this Council
                            who were sitting on the Council at that time will recall that the matter
                            was not exhaustively considered after the Soviet rep made known that his
                            negative attitude towards the admission of Italy had not changed.</p>
                        <p>As the members of the Council will also recall, the Soviet Union has
                            attempted in the past to tie the Ital application with the applications
                            recd from the other ex-enemy states. This course of action, to our
                            minds, is completely unjustified. Each application must, in conformity
                            with the Charter, be considered on its own merits. The Soviet Union by
                            attemping to place the Ital application in the same category as the
                            applications reed from states which this Council has determined to be
                            unqualified for membership does a grave injustice to the Ital people.
                            Surely, there is no justice in penalizing a people who have proved
                            themselves to be qualified for membership, by coupling them with states
                            which by their own actions have shown they are clearly disqualified.</p>
                        <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0214"/>
                        <p>This attempt at bargaining is surely beneath the dignity of this
                            Council.</p>
                        <p>If on this renewed reconsideration of the Ital application the same
                            tactics are attempted, and if this Council should unfortunately fail to
                            recommend Italy’s admission, the world will have no doubt as to the
                            reason for this injustice. The world can interpret the act in no other
                            way than as an expression by the Soviet Union of a lack of friendship
                            for the people of Italy.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion may I stress again that Italy’s record clearly merits
                            admission to the United Nations. The Ital people have suffered greatly,
                            they have worked hard, and they have proven to the satisfaction of my
                            Govt and, I believe, to that of all democratic nations, that they have
                            earned their right to a seat in the world’s councils. My Govt has faith
                            in the Ital people. It asks that they be granted immediately their
                            rightful position among the nations. It holds that their contribution to
                            the world community, based on generations of spiritual and intellectual
                            attainment, will add immeasurably to the betterment of that community.
                            It maintains that further to deny or condition in any way Italy’s
                            admission to the United Nations is to express a lack of faith in her
                            people, that it is without moral or juridical justification as I
                            interpret the principles of the Charter, that it is unfriendly to a free
                            democratic nation, and that it is unworthy of any nation or nations
                            represented here.”<note n="1" xml:id="d138fn1">The Security Council

                                Council regarding admittance of new members gave rise to the view
                                that applicant states whose admission had been prevented by this
                                deadlock should be given some form of participation in the work of
                                the United Nations on an informal basis short of full membership.
                                The United States itself had given a particular stimulus to this
                                idea, when, after the Soviet refusal to recommend Italy on April 10,
                                Ambassador Austin had stated <p>“It would appear desirable in these
                                    circumstances for attention to be paid to the possibility of
                                    devising means whereby such States may be able to have a voice
                                    in the General Assembly of the United Nations. The General
                                    Assembly of the United Nations is the master of its own house.
                                    It could, therefore, choose a method which, at least in part,
                                    would do away with the present unfair and unjust
                                    disqualification of nations which have every moral right to
                                    become Members of the United Nations. Such a formula which would
                                    permit the voice of Italy and of certain other States to be
                                    heard in the General Assembly of the United Nations, can and
                                    should be found.” (United Nations, <hi rend="italic">Official

                        <p>A–120. The Department has noted statements by MacBride in the Dail on
                            July 20th that the Irish Government may find it necessary in the near
                            future to consider withdrawing Ireland’s application for membership in
                            the United Nations. Such action would be received with regret by this
                            Government. It would be open to the interpretation that Ireland was less
                            anxious to play her part in the community of nations, an interpretation
                            at variance with the main purport of MacBride’s speech and with the
                            general course of recent Irish foreign policy. It would also be a
                            further reflection upon the prestige of the United Nations, at a time
                            when all efforts are needed to maintain the authority of the
                            organization. Although Irish sensibilities have no doubt been wounded by
                            the failure to obtain admission to membership, the reason for this
                            failure, namely the veto of the Soviet Union given upon grounds not
                            provided for in the Charter, reflects no discredit upon Ireland and
                            cannot damage her position in world opinion. On the other hand, it is
                            difficult to see what benefits, if any, would accrue to Ireland from
                            withdrawing the application.</p>
                        <p>The United States has voted for the admission of Ireland in the past and
                            is preparing to support the Irish application during the forthcoming
                            General Assembly. The general line of our argument is expected to be
                            that Ireland fulfills the qualifications for membership prescribed in
                            the Charter; that it is a peace-loving state able and willing to accept
                            the obligations of membership; that in its relations with other states
                            and with other international organizations it has demonstrated respect
                            for international commitments; and that for all these reasons Ireland
                            should be allowed to accept the privileges and benefits, as well as the
                            duties, which flow from membership in the organization. While we cannot
                            hold out any hope that the veto will not be used again, the Department
                            feels that more is to be gained by keeping the matter <pb n="199"
                                xml:id="pg_199" facs="0219"/>open before the United Nations than by
                            proposals such as MacBride’s to withdraw application.</p>
                        <p>In your discretion, please see MacBride and communicate to him the
                            substance of the foregoing. You may also inform him in this connection
                            that the United States would be prepared to support an application by
                            Ireland for membership in <gloss target="#t_UNESCO1">UNESCO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Should occasion arise you may wish to thank MacBride for his friendly
                            references to Irish relations with the United States, which are heartily

                            U.S. Government as presented at meetings of deputies.</p>
                        <p>Jessup then added that he would be curious to know whether there might
                            not be some change in the Soviet attitude towards Italian membership in
                            view of their attitude toward the former Italian Colonies.</p>
                        <p>Malik repeated that he had no information on this subject, and Jessup
                            very casually suggested that he might wish to inquire concerning his
                            government’s viewpoint.</p>

                        <p>[Here follows discussion of recommendations 1 and 2. The second was
                            discussed in considerably greater detail than the first, particular
                            attention being paid to the dissenting opinion rendered by Judge Krylov
                            (USSR) in the <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss>’s advisory opinion.
                            Discussion then continued on recommendation 3, “Action concerning
                            rejected applicants”.</p>
                        <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Request for Further Consideration of Qualified
                                Applicants by Security Council</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is recommended that the United States support or initiate a resolution
                            reaffirming the General Assembly resolutions of 1947 supporting
                            Transjordan, Ireland, Portugal, Italy, Finland and Austria, and
                            requesting reconsideration of their applications, as well as that of
                            Ceylon in the light of the advisory opinion of the International Court
                            of Justice and of the General Assembly’s views. Such reconsideration
                            might be requested to take place during the current Assembly
                            session.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, a specific recommendation should be made that the
                            Court’s advisory opinion be applied in the reconsideration of these
                            applications. The opinion would, if applied, require at the least, some
                            modification of the grounds given by the Soviet Union for its vetoes of
                            all applications except that of Ceylon. A reasonable application of it,
                            in good faith, should result in the withdrawal of Soviet objections to
                            Italy and Finland. As to Ireland, Portugal and Transjordan, it should
                            result in the abandonment, modification or explanation of one of the
                            grounds given for Soviet opposition—the absence of diplomatic relations.
                            As noted above (section 2), therefore, the Soviet Delegation may argue
                            on the basis of the minority view, with attempts to justify some of the
                            vetoes even under the opinion of the Court. In the cases of Italy and
                            Finland, a repetition of the usual charges as to violation of the
                            Potsdam agreement and the peace treaties by the United States <pb
                                n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0223"/>and other Members may be
                            expected as part of this defense. These questions have been argued at
                            length on a number of occasions in the Security Council and General
                            Assembly, where we have given a complete answer to the accusations. As
                            to the Potsdam agreement, we have frequently pointed out that the
                            language is permissive and that it certainly was not designed to
                            override the requirements of Article 4 of the Charter.</p>
                        <p>It seems sufficient to include in the resolution a recommendation that
                            the application concerned should be reconsidered in the light of the
                            opinion of the Court.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, a re-affirmation of the General Assembly resolutions relating
                            to Transjordan, Ireland, Portugal, Italy and Finland would be desirable.
                            In these resolutions, the General Assembly declared that these States
                            qualify for membership and that the Soviet vetoes were “based on grounds
                            not included in the Charter”. In order to permit no doubt to arise from
                            its silence, now that the Court’s opinion has been handed down, this
                            position should be reaffirmed. These declarations should be understood
                            to mean a criticism either of the grounds mentioned or of the
                            reasonableness or good faith with which these grounds were applied in
                            particular instances by the Soviet Union. They go, therefore, a
                            considerable distance beyond the Court’s opinion, since the latter
                            involved no appraisal of the conduct of any State in any concrete
                            case.</p>
                        <p>As noted above, Ceylon’s application was rejected in the Security Council
                            through a Soviet veto. The application should, accordingly, be included
                            in the resolution, but no judgment made as to the grounds on which the
                            USSR opposed it.</p>
                        <p>Any proposal to include in the resolution a recommendation in favor of
                            the admission of the Soviet-sponsored group (Albania, Mongolian Peoples
                            Republic, Hungary, Rumania and Bulgaria) should be opposed. Unless some
                            conciliatory Soviet move in the membership field should be made, our
                            opposition would presumably be successful. However, we should be
                            prepared to agree to renew Resolution 113 (II)–A, requesting
                            consultation among the great powers as to all rejected applications.</p>

                        <p>On November 15, 1948 the General Assembly at Paris established an <hi

                            subjects in detail at eleven meetings on November 22–27 and at two more
                            meetings on December 1 and 2. On the first day of its deliberations, the
                            committee was informed of the views of the United States, substantially
                            along the lines indicated in the preceding paper (see United Nations,

                                <cell>Because the types of Security Council decisions referred to in
                                    this section—decisions that are not procedural—require the
                                    concurring votes of all of the five permanent members of the

                                    Chapter VI. Therefore, with this one exception any on permanent

                                <cell>The voting formula was worked out at Yalta by President
                                    Roosevelt, Mr. Stalin, and Mr. Churchill. The requirement of
                                    unanimity of the great powers reflected in the voting formula of
                                    the Security Council was closely tied to one of the basic forces
                                    which made possible the establishment of the United Nations, the
                                    coordinated action of the great powers during the last war and
                                    in preparation for the San Francisco Conference. The view of the
                                    United States was expressed in the Report to the President on
                                    the San Francisco Conference presented by the Secretary of State

                                        <p>“This war was won not by any one country but by the

                                            by the brilliantly coordinated strategy of the great

                                            unity that the people and Government of the United
                                            States have altered their conception of national
                                            security. We understand that in the world of today a
                                            unilateral national policy of security is as outmoded as

                                            the rocket planes of 1970. We know that for the United
                                            States—and for other great powers—there can be no

                                <cell>Yes. However, we do not feel that the desirability of
                                    unanimity of the Permanent Members, especially on the most

                                    of the voting procedure as it is now applied. To quote from the

                                        <p>“We were always fully aware that the successful operation
                                            of the rule of unanimity would require the exercise of
                                            restraint by the permanent members and we so expressed
                                            ourselves at San Francisco. It is our hope that, despite
                                            our experience to date, such restraint will be practiced
                                            in the future by the permanent members. The abuse of the
                                            right of unanimity has prevented the Security Council
                                            from fulfilling its true functions. This has been
                                            especially true in cases arising under Chapter VI and in
                                            the admission of new members. The Government of the

                                            practical method for improving this situation is a
                                            liberalization of the voting procedure in the Council.
                                            The United States would be walling to accept by whatever

                                    that permanent members of the Security Council will not use
                                    their veto power wilfully to obstruct the operation of the

                                <cell>Their adoption would probably materially increase the
                                    effectiveness of the Security Council. However, further

                                    would probably be necessary. The United States view of the steps
                                    to be taken in this direction is stated in the Secretary’s
                                    speech of September 13, 1947, to the General Assembly as

                                <cell>France and the U.S.S.R. jointly exercised the veto on one

                                    the U.S.S.R. in the Indonesian case. It is only fair to state
                                    that all of the permanent members have at times expressed

                                <cell>No. There is no such thing in the Security Council as the

                                    the U.S.S.R. did not prevent the deliberations of the Security

                                        xml:id="pg_210" facs="0230"/>There have been a number of
                                    formal votes on substantive matters where all permanent members
                                    were in agreement. However, frequently the Security Council has
                                    proceeded without voting when it has found that its members were
                                    all in agreement. It must be remembered, furthermore, that the
                                    tendency has been to bring to the Security Council matters in
                                    which disagreement among permanent members of the Security
                                    Council were pronounced. Other matters never reached the stage
                                    where it could be claimed that they could endanger international
                                    peace and security and thus be a proper subject for discussion
                                    in the Security Council. Since the begining of the Security
                                    Council, we would be safe in saying that the areas of agreement
                                    among permanent members of the Security Council have in general
                                    exceeded the areas of disagreement.</cell>

                                        xml:id="pg_211" facs="0231"/>in his statement to Committee 1
                                    of the General Assembly on November 18, 1947: <quote
                                        rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>“We believe, therefore, that the General Assembly should
                                            proceed carefully and with consideration for the
                                            reasoned views of all the members, whether they
                                            represent large countries or small. We hope that out of
                                            such an approach will come developments which will
                                            enable the Security Council to discharge more
                                            effectively its primary responsibility for the
                                            maintenance of international peace and security.”</p>
                                        <p>“It may be asked whether that is a mere pious hope or has
                                            it, in fact, any substance. I think it has substance. If
                                            voting in the Security Council is under observation and
                                            study currently throughout the year, almost certainly
                                            that will influence Security Council members to improve
                                            their own voting procedures. Also, serious study on
                                            behalf of the General Assembly will, I believe, lead to
                                            better relations in this matter between the General
                                            Assembly and the Security Council.</p>
                                        <p>“At present, there seems to be a tendency on the part of
                                            the General Assembly, perhaps, to over-simplify the
                                            problem. We are inclined, once a year, to strike out
                                            against what we call the abuse in the use of the veto.
                                            But we have not really given the matter serious study. I
                                            am confident that if the General Assembly should give
                                            the problem the kind of study which, for example, our
                                            Sub-Committee gave to the problem of setting-up the
                                            Interim Committee, the next General Assembly would
                                            approach this problem with a much better and more
                                            sympathetic understanding of the problem and with much
                                            more understanding and sympathy toward the attitude of
                                            the Security Council and the permanent members.</p>
                                        <p>“I believe that only out of an attitude of sympathy and
                                            understanding between coordinate bodies, rather than out
                                            of an attitude of antagonism between them, can come the
                                            possibility of really finding; improvement in this
                                            field.”</p>

                                    their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner
                                    that international peace and security, and justice are not
                                    endangered,” and to “refrain in their international relations
                                    from the threat or use of force against the territorial
                                    integrity or political independence of any State, or in any

                                    commitments. It is true that if one of the great powers violates
                                    the Charter, ultimately the only way to enforce the law is by a
                                    major war. That, however, would be just as true if the Charter
                                    did not require unanimity of the permanent members of the

                            solely as a backstop for failures by the Security Council. He attached
                            absolutely no importance to Article 11(1) or Article 13(1) a.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d149fn4">Article 11 (1) reads: “The General Assembly may
                                consider the general principles of cooperation in the maintenance of
                                international peace and security, including the principles governing
                                disarmament and the regulation of armaments, and may make
                                recommendations with regard to such principles to the Members or to
                                the Security Council or to both.” <p>Article 13 (1) <hi
                                        rend="italic">a</hi> reads: “The General Assembly shall
                                    initiate studies and make recommendations for the purpose

                                <p>These were presumed to be fitting subjects for the consideration
                                    of the newly established Interim Committee, in the development
                                    of a work program for the committee.</p>
                            </note>
                        </p>
                        <p>On the question of the veto he was confident that the Interim Committee
                            could accomplish nothing whatever. He thought debate of the veto in the
                            Interim Committee would, however, serve the useful purpose of continuing
                            to educate public opinion, not only in the United-States but throughout
                            the world as to the implications of the veto. He thought that discussion
                            of the veto to date had led to a very much better informed public
                            opinion during the last twelve months and it would be desirable to
                            continue the process of education. However, he did not see why such
                            debate could not begin right away; he was dismayed by the proposed delay
                            in consideration of the matter by the Interim Committee. In the course
                            of his remarks Berendsen said that any mitigation of the effects of the
                            veto simply would not be enough. It had to be eliminated entirely in
                            order to have an effective collective security system. It was, however,
                            Utopian to think that the veto could <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214"
                                facs="0234"/>be eliminated. The Interim Committee might therefore
                            foe considered in a sense as a bridge between the present ineffective
                            organization and an organization which might provide collective security
                            for the rest of the world without Russia. He admitted, however, that any
                            effort to accomplish this purpose would in effect result in two security
                            systems involving a race for predominant power which could only end in
                            catastrophe.</p>
                        <p>The general tenor and implication of all of Sir Carl’s remarks were that
                            all of the Members of the Interim Committee looked to the United States
                            for leadership and the United States had failed on Monday to provide it
                            and he did not see any signs that it would be provided.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Austin made it clear that he could not agree at all with the
                            views Sir Carl had expressed. He thought that everything that should
                            have been accomplished on Monday had been accomplished. There had not
                            been any useless and pointless substantive discussion. The United States
                            had proposed a specific resolution setting forth an orderly procedure
                            whereby Members of the Committe could submit proposals concerning the
                            veto and whereby these proposals could foe considered thoughtfully. A
                            committee on procedures had been established and set to work with
                            instructions to report back by Friday. He emphasized that any Members
                            could bring matters to the Interim Committee and that there was no
                            barrier to discussion.</p>
                        <p>More specifically on the veto question the Ambassador told Sir Carl that
                            before the Interim Committee could usefully undertake any consideration
                            of this subject it was necessary to know whether the Soviet Union would
                            concede anything at all with regard to the veto. He had spoken brieflly
                            to Gromyko<note n="5" xml:id="d149fn5">Andrey Andreyevich Gromyko,
                                Permanent Representative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
                                at the United Nations.</note> yesterday and tried to find out if
                            Gromyko would be willing to participate in the consultations envisaged
                            in the General Assembly resolution establishing the Interim Committee.
                            It would be better to proceed patiently and slowly and find out just
                            where the Soviet Union stands on this matter rather than rushing
                            impetuously into it in the Interim Committee and thereby risk losing
                            even whatever slight possibility there might be of getting Soviet
                            acceptance of modifications in practice. The Ambassador was still
                            hopeful and in any event meant to find out whether it would foe possible
                            to get any agreed interpretation with the Soviets of the meaning of the
                            Four Power Statement; also whether it would be possible to get from them
                            any agreement on the non-application of the veto by defining as
                            procedural questions such matters as the establishment of commissions of
                            investigation.</p>

                        <p>It was my general impression that this conversation which lasted about an
                            hour had at least made some dent in Berendsen’s pessimism and helped to
                            straighten out his thinking on the Interim Committee.</p>

                                21, 1947, the General Assembly had requested the permanent members
                                of the Security Council to consult among themselves on the problem
                                of voting in the Security Council “in order to secure agreement
                                among them on measures to ensure the prompt and effective exercise
                                by the Security Council of its functions.” The Committee of Experts
                                of the Security Council was established by the Security Council at
                                London in January, 1946 in order to formulate permanent rules of
                                procedure for the conduct of business by the Security Council.
                                Considerable work had been accomplished by the Committee of Experts
                                in. 1946, but, despite much discussion, the committee had not
                                succeeded in providing an acceptable draft for a permanent rule
                                regarding voting procedure; for documentation regarding these
                                matters, see <ref target="frus1946v01#pg_251">

                        <p>The basic US position on veto in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> was
                            expressed by Secretary Marshall in his statement to the <gloss

                            stated that abuse of unanimity rule had prevented <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> from fulfilling its true functions, particularly under
                            Chap VI and in admission of new members; that US had come to conclusion
                            that only practicable method for improving situation was a
                            liberalization of voting procedure in Council; that US would be willing
                            to accept, by whatever means may be appropriate, elimination of
                            unanimity requirement under Chap VI and for such matters as applications
                            for membership; that problem of how to achieve objective of
                            liberalization was of significance and complexity for <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and deserved careful study, that
                            consequently, the matter should be referred to a special committee for
                            study and report to the next session of the <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss> and concurrently measures should be pressed in <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> to bring about improvements within <pb

                            through amendments to rules of procedure or other feasible means.</p>
                        <p>The US is committed to seek a liberalization of voting procedures of
                            Council and, if necessary to that end, is willing to accept by any
                            appropriate means elimination of veto in Chap VI and in membership
                            questions. The US, however, is not committed to press for any specific
                            method designed to achieve the improvement, such as amendment of the
                            Charter or modification of San Francisco Statement.</p>
                        <p>In effort to achieve above aims the US believes that first step is

                                >SC</gloss>. In this consultation permanent members might agree:</p>

                                        of disputes, adjustment of situations likely to lead to

                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> resolution, by July 15. The US bas not
                            itself determined what proposals, if any, it should submit to the <gloss
                                target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss> in response to this invitation. It is its
                            belief that until there has been an opportunity to see the results of
                            the Big Five consultation and of the consideration of the rules proposed
                            by the US and any other members of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            in the Committee of Experts, it would be premature for the US to make
                            such proposals.</p>
                        <p>The US recognizes that there can be no amendment to the Charter of the

                            permanent members of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. Nor do we
                            believe that an amendment to the Charter is the only means available to
                            achieve most of the US’s objectives directed toward the liberalization
                            of the voting procedures of the Council. They can be gained by agreement
                            among the permanent members.</p>
                        <p>The Council of Foreign Ministers in Nov 1946 held two meetings on this
                            subject in which various proposals were put forward.<note n="3"

                                >SC</gloss> should be strengthened, that the permanent Members had
                            the greatest responsibility to this end and that there should be

                            to be no reason why this consultation of the permanent Members should
                            not continue that consideration in an effort to make further progress in

                        <p>After a general statement relating to the objective of peace and
                            abolition of war contained in the Charter and especially in the
                            unanimity principle regarding voting in the Security Council, I stated
                            that the US position was the same as stated by General Marshall and that
                            we adhere now to the proposition that he made that the US is willing, if
                            the other four powers are willing to do so, to waive the veto in
                            proceedings under Chapter VI and in issues regarding the admission of
                            new members, treating these matters as procedural and not
                            substantive.</p>
                        <p>I then made the following suggestions in order to introduce the

                            <item>We would review and bring up to date the Four Power Declaration of
                                June 1945. I indicated that the basis for such a review is the
                                discovery from experience that the assumptions on which that
                                statement is based have turned out to be inaccurate in some
                                respects, including the assumption that it will be unlikely that
                                there will arise in future any matters of great importance on which
                                an opinion will have to be made as to whether a procedural vote
                                would apply.</item>

                            <item>We could extend and clarify the list of decisions which are

                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>We could improve the procedures in the Security Council so as to
                                insure that a party to a dispute must abstain, by agreeing that the
                                preliminary decision as to whether a matter fell within the proviso
                                of Article 27 (3) was a procedural matter.</item>

                            <item>We could determine whether the proposals of the US in the
                                Committee of Experts relating to the use of the veto have our assent
                                and backing.</item>

                            <item>I asked what their position would be regarding the submission of
                                any proposals by a permanent member for the Interim Committee being
                                submitted to the Five Powers for discussion (not necessarily
                                agreement) before submitting them to the Interim Committee.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>With respect to the waiver of veto in matters under Chapter VI and on the
                            admission of new states, no one present agreed to the idea of waiver and
                            all of them opposed amendment of the Charter. Quite some emphasis was
                            laid upon opposition to an attempt to amend the Charter. With respect to
                            the detailed suggestions I had made, the other representatives took the
                            following positions:</p>
                        <p>Cadogan supported consideration of these suggestions and indicated an
                            affirmative view on all of them excepting the last one, and as to that
                            one he stated he would refer to his government with a recommendation on
                            his part that this practice be adopted.</p>
                        <p>Gromyko discussed each of the suggestions and stated that the position of
                            his government is no different [than] that he had expressed many times.
                            In detail he said that he is opposed to any and all of these
                            suggestions; that the Four Power declaration did all of the clarifying
                            that is necessary; that it is perfectly plain and unambiguous.</p>
                        <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0239"/>
                        <p>As to the assumption underlying Part II of the Four Power statement being
                            ill founded, he claimed that, nevertheless, the obligation was stated to
                            be the same whether the assumption were sound or false for he said it
                            reads “Should, however, such matter arise, …”. To him that means that,
                            notwithstanding the unexpected has occurred, the practice is clearly
                            defined in the statement and requires concurrence of the five permanent
                            members. With respect to the meetings of the Committee of Experts he
                            said no meetings have been held to discuss the subject of our proposals.
                            The Soviet Union will be present and participate in the discussion. This
                            does not indicate that the USSR will agree to any of them, in that they
                            are opposed to them.</p>
                        <p>During his reply I interrupted him to ask a specific question, normally,
                            if under Chapter VI or Article 52 of the Charter a matter was up for
                            consideration which involved a permanent member as a party and the
                            permanent member would claim that he was not a party, whether the USSR
                            would be willing to agree to the statement to which the deputies agreed
                            at their 24th meeting in San Francisco. I read him this extract which
                            stated “This question seems to be based on a most unlikely hypothesis,
                            but if a permanent member of the Council were involved in a dispute and
                            argued in the Council that he was not involved in a dispute, the Council
                            would presumably make its decision on this point by a vote of seven,
                            including the votes of the permanent members other than the permanent
                            member who was alleged to be involved in the dispute”.</p>
                        <p>He made a definite refusal to consider that and said the answer was
                            merged in the Four Power statement which is directly to the
                            contrary.</p>
                        <p>Then I asked him whether he would care to meet and consult, try to agree
                            with the other permanent members on any specific question of this
                            character and he replied “I cannot answer. I would have to know what the
                            substance of the question is. The Soviet Union takes the position that
                            it is up to each member of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> to
                            decide the question whether, he is or is not a party to the dispute and
                            to act accordingly”.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the query regarding discussion of any proposal by a
                            permanent member to the Interim Committee, he did not object to that but
                            he said “You know perfectly well that I will not participate in the
                            Interim Committee directly or indirectly and what I have said here today
                            would have been said in the same way and to the same effect if there
                            were no Interim Committee, I ignore it in my statement”.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Hsia fully supported the suggestions which I had made and stated
                            among other things that there is an actual disagreement among the Big
                            Five which ought to be clarified regarding the application of the
                            proviso to Article 27, and also regarding the application of Part 2 of
                            the Four Power Agreement. Hsia favored getting together regarding <pb
                                n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0240"/>any proposal that any one of
                            the permanent members intends to make before it is filed in the Interim
                            Committee. He claimed that discussions might improve such proposals
                            before they are filed and facilitate their consideration in the
                            Committee.</p>
                        <p>De la Tournelle favored our suggestions and added that not only would he
                            like the idea of discussion by the Five Powers regarding proposals for
                            the Interim Committee, but he thought that we might avoid some of the
                            difficulty if we had such conferences regularly before any proposals are
                            to be made in the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> by any one of the
                            permanent members. His first statement we understood to mean
                            consultation plus agreement. He explained that that was not what he
                            meant. He meant that we could avoid the ill feeling and embarrassment
                            that has arisen if we did not push matters to a vote in the <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> when we have found out by conference that
                            there would be a veto. Therefore he favored conferences on all issues of
                            such character as might provoke a veto. He said that he did not intend
                            to have the proponent withdraw his proposal or not present it just
                            because of a failure of agreement, but that his point was that he
                            favored consultation as a general rule.</p>
                        <p>Thus it appeared that we were all agreed upon all points excepting
                            Gromyko and excepting the British reservations on my fifth
                            suggestion.</p>
                        <p>I called upon them all regarding publicity of this meeting, as to what
                            the answer should be to the press if they found out about it. We agreed
                            that it should be simply a statement that we had met to discuss the veto
                            and had discussed many aspects of the subject and had not come to a
                            decision. If asked whether we intended to meet again, the reply should
                            be that that is not excluded.</p>
                        <p>The Conference ended at 4:15.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of this paper is to outline a suggested US position on the
                            veto over the next six months or so—both in the <gloss target="#t_GA1"

                            seems essential that our position in those two separate forums should be
                            integrated and that we should have before us not only definite aims but
                            a general understanding of the procedures we propose to support in these

                        <p>There are a number of procedures which might be followed, alone or in
                            combination, in seeking to attain our objective. The question of the
                            choice of procedure is most difficult and most important. It is clear
                            that the procedures adopted in the two separate forums in the <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> should be integrated into a single
                            program.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that the following general program might be adopted:</p>

                            <item>The US is willing to consider the attainment of its objectives by
                                the process of amendment of the Charter, if this is necessary, and
                                if it appears practicable. Since at the moment it does not appear

                                of support from the other members of the Big Five, the US should, in

                                    >GA</gloss>, emphasize that all other methods of attaining our
                                objective should be attempted first before amendment of the Charter

                            <item>The most practicable method of attaining the US objectives would
                                seem to be action by the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and the
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> to liberalize the veto
                                procedure to the fullest possible extent consistent with the
                                provisions of the Charter. The US should propose or support a
                                proposal that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should decide to
                                place in the category of procedural decisions requiring only seven
                                votes in the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, all those categories
                                of decisions listed in paragraph 1 above provided that such action
                                may be taken without violation of the legal obligations imposed by
                                the Charter and is consistent with the Charter. The question of the
                                legal validity of such action under the Charter should be submitted
                                by the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss> for an advisory opinion. The action
                                of the US to accomplish this purpose should be a recommendation of
                                the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, consistent with the opinion
                                of the <gloss target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss>, directed to the SO and put
                                into effect by the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> through the

                        <p>We should proceed with our present program in the <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> and press our proposals to the Committee of Experts to a
                            decision taking a majority recommendation to the <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> at the earliest possible opportunity. We should not
                            attempt to determine now how far to press these rules in the <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> prior to action in the <gloss
                                target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                            >GA</gloss>. We should keep definitely in mind the advantages of
                            establishing a precedent or at least public support of a majority of the
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> for the proposition that rules of
                            procedure regarding voting may be adopted by the <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> by a procedural vote. We should also be prepared to
                            propose that any seriously disputed legal points should be put by the SO
                            to the <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss> for an advisory opinion. If
                            the request for an advisory opinion were blocked by a Soviet veto, it
                            might be undesirable to press to a conclusion the argument that the
                            making of such a request is itself a procedural question, but the
                            resulting situation would help us in our program in the <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>We should place before the <gloss target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss>, after
                            consultation among the five, a proposal along the following lines: the
                                <gloss target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss> should examine all possible
                            categories of decisions which the Council may make under the Charter and
                            should recommend to the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> which of these
                            categories of decisions <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0243"/>should
                            be taken by a procedural vote and which should be taken by a substantive
                            vote. The <gloss target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss> should recommend that the
                            Assembly, if it accepts these recommendations, should recommend to the
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> that it adopt rules of procedure
                            putting these recommendations into effect. The <gloss target="#t_IC1"
                                >IC</gloss> should, however, also recommend to the <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> that since the question has arisen as to
                            certain of the categories involved as to whether it is legally
                            permissible to interpret the Charter in such a way that such categories
                            of decisions may be taken by the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> by a
                            procedural vote, the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> should request an
                            advisory opinion on this subject from the <gloss target="#t_ICJ1"
                                >ICJ</gloss> before making any recommendation to the <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The US proposal might indicate a list of categories which should be
                            considered as procedural rather than substantive. This list should
                            include all those categories which are included in the Committee of
                            Experts report to the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, as well as any
                            others which we desire to include.</p>
                        <p>The US proposal might also deal with the problem of opening up the
                            expanded activity of the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> in connection
                            with political questions whenever the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            is prevented by an exercise of the veto from taking action. Such a
                            proposal might bear particularly on the immediate future during the
                            period when long-range adjustments are in process of development. In
                            this connection, it might be proposed that the <gloss target="#t_IC1"
                                >IC</gloss> could recommend to the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>
                            that the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> adopt a resolution requesting
                            the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> to remove from its agenda any
                            question in regard to which it was unable to take effective steps
                            because of the exercise of the veto, in order that the bar presented by
                            paragraph 1 of article 12 might be removed and that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> might be in a position to deal with the
                            question.</p>
                        <p>The US position regarding the Four Power statement would be that
                            specified by Mr. Dulles in his opening speech to Committee 1 in the
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. It would be clear from the
                            content of the US list of proposed procedural decisions that it was
                            prepared to abandon the positions taken in the Four Power statement. It
                            would probably be useful to explain that the US would continue to abide
                            by the present practice of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> until
                            after the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> had acted to revise it.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that we should aim to complete the discussions in the
                            Committee of Experts and to present a majority report to the <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and to have at least preliminary
                            discussions in the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> before the US has
                            submitted its proposal to the <gloss target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The ideal situation would be that the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            have an opportunity to tackle the Committee of Experts report and reach
                            a deadlock with the Soviet Union on this, perhaps making an effort to
                            get an advisory opinion from the court before consideration of the US
                            proposal in the <gloss target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss> commenced. If this
                            timetable should be delayed, however, it would not present any serious
                            difficulties. The US proposals to the <gloss target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss>
                            are such that they could be put forward even though the Committee of
                            Experts report had not been finalized. If the Russian position is
                            absolutely rigid on this issue this would provide adequate basis for
                            moving ahead in the <gloss target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The outcome of such a program, assuming it was carried through the <gloss
                                target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss> to the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>,
                            would be that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> through the Assembly
                            would pronounce itself on how far it wished and felt it legitimate to go
                            in liberalizing the veto within the confines of the Charter. During the
                                <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0244"/>year following the next
                            regular session of the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, two courses of
                            action could be followed: the first would be that the <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> should proceed to adopt rules of
                            procedure, by majority voting if necessary, as to any items which had
                            not been submitted to the court for an opinion, the United Nations would
                            probably have to wait for an additional year before effective action
                            could be taken to put into effect the opinion of the court. During this
                            entire period it would be open to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            if they so desired, to proceed with efforts to amend the Charter or with
                            efforts to attain agreement among the five powers either for revision of
                            the Four Power statement or for some similar agreement waiving the veto
                            in certain cases. It would also be open to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>, if they so desired, to make increasing use of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> following the pattern of the
                            action in the Greek case. In this connection our position might be that
                            the philosophy of the Charter was that resort to the <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> rather than to the <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss> was preferable where subsequent enforcement action under
                            chapter VII might be required. Where the use of the veto precludes the
                            possibility of action under chapter VII, the <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss> or a permanent “interim committee” can do as much as the
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> can do, as, for example in
                            appointing a commission of inquiry. Thus the <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss> would have had the power to do in the Indonesian case,
                            and first phase of the Indian-Pakistan case, precisely what was done by
                            the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The above program is conceived with the purpose of progressing as far as
                            possible in the direction of liberalizing the veto over the objections
                            of the Soviet Union. Given this aim, one of its principal advantages is
                            that it proceeds slowly and carefully and affords the Soviet Union as
                            little excuse as possible to claim that the Charter is being violated
                            and consequently to boycott the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> or
                            take some other similarly drastic action.</p>

                        <p>Sir Alexander advised Ambassador Austin at the Security Council meeting
                            today that his Government agreed with Mr. Austin’s proposal made at the

                            present to the Interim Committee on the Veto problem. He said that the
                            British Delegation planned to present a proposal to the Interim
                            Committee containing the same program they had placed before the

                                    >urtel</gloss> represent changes which US would be willing to

                                proposals which will completely accomplish these objectives. On
                                other hand objectives 3 and 4 represent changes which US has already

                        </list>
                        <p>As to 1, Dept sees no reason to single out Art 52(3) as that is only a
                            procedure or method of adjustment and therefore covered under Art 36(1).
                            Dept is agreeable to accomplishing restriction of veto under Chapter VI
                            through Charter amendment, through agreement among permanent members not
                            to utilize veto, or through establishment of practice or rule that
                            decisions under Chapter VI should be procedural. Since Charter amendment
                            is impracticable procedure because of necessity of USSR ratification
                            Depts proposals will be directed towards; accomplishing restriction of
                            veto through agreement of permanent members or through practice or rule
                            of procedure.</p>
                        <p>Because of doubtful legal validity US should not support proposal for
                            rule of procedure establishing as procedural decisions under Art 37 but
                            may advocate restriction veto under Art 37 either through Charter
                            amendment or agreement.</p>
                        <p>As to 2, Dept is likewise agreeable to accomplishing restriction of veto
                            through Charter amendment through agreement of permanent <pb n="226"
                                xml:id="pg_226" facs="0246"/>members not to utilize veto or through
                            establishment of practice or rule that decisions on admission of members
                            are procedural. Agreement among permanent members on admission of
                            specific applicants might also substantially achieve Dept
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>As to 3 and 4, unlike 1, 2 and 5, they represent proposals which US is
                            pressing at this time. US would of course be willing to accept as
                            procedural certain additional categories of decisions not listed in
                            proposed rules submitted by US.</p>
                        <p>As to 5, US would be willing to eliminate entirely part II of Four Power
                            statement by making preliminary decision procedural matter. However
                            since there are other means of accomplishing same objective it is
                            suggested that US position be restated as follows:</p>
                        <p>Practices should be established in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> to
                            ensure that part II of Four Power statement cannot be utilized to permit
                            exercise of veto in general categories of <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> decisions determined to be procedural in Charter, Rules
                            of Procedure and Part I of statement. Dept view is that Part I, para 1
                            of Four Power statement establishes as procedural all <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> decisions excepting decisions pursuant to
                            Chapters VI and VII of Charter and excepting certain other specific
                            decisions agreed upon at SF such as admission, suspension and expulsion
                            of members and election of <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>. Under
                            this interpretation of agreement Four Powers were justified in
                            concluding that “It will be unlikely that there will arise in the future
                            any matters of great importance on which a decision will have to be made
                            as to whether a procedural vote would apply”.</p>
                        <p>A sixth substantive objective which is discussed in detail in another
                            portion of <gloss target="#t_urtel1">urtel</gloss> might be worded as
                            follows: “Voting procedures should be clarified in connection with all
                            decisions which <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> is required to make
                            under Charter and under statute of <gloss target="#t_ICJ1"
                            >ICJ</gloss>”.</p>

                                utilizing voting procedures set forth in Art 27 (2).</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Dept position is that maximum efforts should be made both to secure
                            agreement among permanent members and to secure <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> support for US proposals. US will not at this time
                            attempt to implement its proposals in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            through passing a Rule of Procedure or taking other action over
                            objection of USSR.</p>
                        <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0247"/>
                        <p>It is not considered politically advisable at this time to attempt to
                            pass Rule of Procedure in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> without
                            consent of USSR. Nevertheless, Committee of Experts should report to
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> showing positions of members
                            regardless of whether agreement reached. However <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> should not vote on Committee of Experts report unless
                            agreement reached on Rules of Procedure. Likewise no attempt should be
                            made to have <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> refer issues at this time
                            to <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>At outset Committee of Experts should confine discussions to US proposals
                            and to proposals along similar lines by other members. If question
                            raised US should indicate unwillingness to discuss proposals in conflict
                            with attitudes expressed in Four Power statement until after <gloss

                        <p>Bathurst had approached me previously to discuss the veto question. I had
                            a short talk with him in the lounge yesterday. He said his Government
                            had put forward proposals to the Interim Committee but that they did not
                            propose to press this hard and apparently did not feel that it is of
                            serious importance. Bathurst said he had forwarded to his Foreign Office
                            a proposal along different lines. He had had preliminary reactions—some
                            favorable and some not, and had been requested to discuss his proposals
                            with us. His proposals in outline are roughly as follows:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>That the Interim Committee should examine all the categories of
                                decisions which the Security Council might take;</p>
                            <p>That it should take from this list all those which might perhaps be
                                considered procedural;</p>
                            <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0248"/>
                            <p>That it should recommend to the General Assembly that this list be
                                sent to the International Court of Justice with the request that the
                                Court give an advisory opinion as to which of these categories of
                                decisions were in the Court’s opinion procedural and which
                                substantive.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>I asked whether he contemplated that the General Assembly should give its
                            own opinion as to which of these categories should be considered
                            procedural or whether there would be an implication that the list sent
                            to the Court should be in the Assembly’s opinion procedural decisions.
                            He said this was not in his mind. He wished to leave the Court free to
                            decide without reference to political considerations. I said I had not
                            yet gotten our position clear from the State Department and that until I
                            did I would not be in a position to talk with him in detail. I hoped,
                            however, we would be in a position to do so in a very short time and
                            that he would then be able to give me in more detail his suggestions. He
                            said he would be glad to at any time.</p>

                        <p>The “Provisional List of Categories of Security Council Decisions “was
                            used by the United Nations Secretariat in preparing a list of possible
                            decisions by the Security Council. This list was used in turn, along
                            with two other papers prepared by the Secretariat, by a Sub-Committee of
                            the Interim Committee (Sub-Committee 3), which the Interim Committee
                            established at its meeting on March 15. This Sub-Committee was
                            instructed to study the problem of voting in the Security Council, along
                            with all proposals submitted to it on the subject, and to prepare a
                            paper to form the basis for recommendations by the Interim Committee for
                            eventual submission to the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>After delays attendant upon the sitting of the Special Session of the
                            General Assembly which met in April and May on the Palestine problem,
                            the Sub-Committee, proceeding through a “working group”, undertook to
                            establish and analyze 98 possible decisions “adopted or which might be
                            adopted by the Security Council in application of the Charter or the
                            Statute of the International Court of Justice.” “The Sub-Committee, in
                            its study of this list, sought to determine those decisions, which its
                            members considered as procedural within the meaning <pb n="232"
                                xml:id="pg_232" facs="0252"/>of Article 27, paragraph 2, of the
                            Charter, and those decisions which, whether considered procedural or
                            non-procedural by the various members of the Sub-Committee, should in
                            the opinion of the Sub-Committee, be taken by a vote of any seven
                            members of the Security Council.” (United Nations, <hi rend="italic"

                            I said that I had been somewhat surprised when M. Orden-neau had earlier
                            in the week reserved the French Delegation’s position on recommendations
                            (1) and (2) of the Interim Committee’s Sub-committee 3. These
                            recommendations related to agreement among the permanent members and
                            other members of the Security Council to regard certain decisions as
                            procedural and certain others as subject to a vote of any seven members
                            whether procedural or non-procedural.</p>
                        <p>M. de La Tournelle replied in effect that there was no reason for
                            surprise, since this action was consistent with the French attitude on
                            veto discussions in the Interim Committee from the beginning. He said
                            that the French had opposed reference of the veto question to the
                            Interim Committee and explained that while the French are emphatically
                            in favor of reducing the area covered by the veto, they have always felt
                            that this should be done by agreement among the permanent <pb n="233"
                                xml:id="pg_233" facs="0253"/>members of the Security Council. When I
                            pointed out that the resolution proposed to the Assembly contemplated
                            exactly that, he replied in effect that even so the Interim Committee
                            should not deal with the problem. When I asked whether that attitude
                            carried over to the Assembly itself, he said that it did. He gave me
                            clearly to understand that the French Delegation both in the Interim
                            Committee and in the Assembly would refuse to favor these first two
                            recommendations from the Interim Committee.</p>
                        <p>When I attempted to suggest that the meetings on the veto held by the
                            Council of Foreign Ministers in New York in the fall of 1946
                            demonstrated the difficulty of bringing about relaxation of the veto by
                            Five Power consultations without any other action, de La Tournelle
                            replied that in effect those meetings had been at least partially
                            successful because there the U.S.S.R. had definitely agreed that
                            abstention is permissible.</p>
                        <p>In the course of our conversation de La Tournelle stated that it has
                            always been his personal view that the French made a mistake in joining
                            the permanent members of the Security Council. Had they not done so,
                            they would have been, not the least of the great but the greatest of the
                            small powers, and would have been able to play a role of leadership and
                            of conciliation far superior to that which they had been playing.</p>

                                    submitted to the Interim Committee in the form of two documents,
                                    United Nations documents A/AC. 18/62 and A/AC. 18/66; and was
                                    discussed in meetings of the Committee on July 7, July 8 and
                                    July 9 (United Nations documents A/AC. 18/15 through A/AC.

                                amend the first recommendation slightly he said that he was entirely
                                agreeable to this proposal and would vote for it, as well as for the
                                other recommendations. He added, however, that he was voting for it
                                merely because he thought it was a good idea, not because he thought
                                these recommendations would have any effect.</item>

                                sparingly the right conferred upon the Permanent Members by Part II,

                                            decision will have to be made as to whether a procedural

                        <p>During our discussion Nisot made it clear that from the juridical point
                            of view he thinks the Soviets have the best of the argument as to the
                            interpretation both of Article 27 and of the Four Power Statement. He
                            was not notably impressed by my argument that matters described as
                            procedural in Part I of the Four Power Statement should be clearly
                            outside of the scope of Part II, Paragraph 2. He said that he remembered
                            well that at San Francisco all the great powers had been strong for a
                            pretty complete right of veto and that the change which had taken place
                            was in the United States position rather than that of the Soviet Union.
                            I insisted that the United States had never interpreted Article 27 nor
                            the Four Power Statement, or expected them to be interpreted, as
                            narrowly as the Soviet Union has done.</p>

                            problem of voting in the Security Council was submitted to the General
                            Assembly in United Nations document A/578, July 15, 1918; for text, see

                        <p>The report consisted of four parts. Part I contained classification by
                            categories of possible decisions of the Security Council and the
                            criteria on which this classification was based: decisions which
                            according to the Statute of the International Court of Justice were
                            taken by an absolute majority of votes of six members of the Security
                            Council, without distinction between permanent and non-permanent
                            members; decisions which according to the Charter of the United Nations
                            or the Court Statute were taken by a vote of any seven members of the
                            Security Council, without distinction between permanent and
                            non-permanent members; decisions which were of a procedural character
                                <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0255"/>within the meaning of
                            Article 27(2) of the Charter; and decisions which the Interim Committee
                            recommended should be adopted by the vote of any seven members of the
                            Security Council, whether the decisions were considered to be procedural
                            or non-procedural.</p>
                        <p>Part II contained a list of 98 possible decisions of the Security Council
                            (88 related to the Charter, 10 to the Statute of the International
                            Court), with conclusions and comments as to the appropriate voting
                            procedure applicable to each of them. This section made up the bulk of
                            the report.</p>
                        <p>Part III dealt with the methods for implementation of the conclusions
                            with regard to the items listed in Part II. Three principal methods were
                            suggested: (1) implementation by means of interpretation of the Charter,
                            (2) implementation on the basis of agreement among the five permanent
                            members of the Security Council, and (3) implementation on the basis of
                            convoking a general conference to review the Charter.</p>

                                conference of the Members of the United Nations as provided for in

                                consultation in fact took place before the commencement of the

                                door was left open for further consultations; that the United States

                        <p>1. Conclusions of the Interim Committee Report.</p>
                        <p>The first conclusion of the Report is that the General Assembly recommend
                            to the members of the Security Council that they deem as procedural on
                            the basis of Charter interpretation, 36 of the possible decisions of the
                            Security Council and that the “members of the Security Council conduct
                            their business accordingly.[”] This would apply to the positions which
                            the members of the Security Council take on the question whether or not
                            any of these items is procedural, in case this question is raised; to
                            the manner in which any member of the Security Council, when acting as
                            President, interprets the result of a vote on such a question; and,
                            finally, to the manner in which the members of the Security Council vote
                            if the ruling made by the President is challenged.”</p>
                        <p>This conclusion does not, however, take the further step of recommending
                            that members of the Security Council, despite the opposition of one or
                            more permanent members, regard as adopted a decision of <pb n="238"
                                xml:id="pg_238" facs="0258"/>the Security Council which receives the
                            support of seven members without the concurrence of all the permanent
                            members and which likewise is voted to be procedural by seven members
                            without the concurrence of all the permanent members. In other words,
                            the United States considers that the General Assembly recommendation
                            does not require the United States to depart from the attitudes
                            expressed in the Four Power Statement, particularly the provision that
                            the preliminary question as to whether a decision not expressly covered
                            by the Charter or the Statement itself, is procedural or non-procedural
                            shall be decided by a non-procedural vote. It should be noted that the
                            conclusion does not call for adoption of new Rules of Procedure for the
                            Security Council.</p>
                        <p>These 36 decisions may all be deemed procedural under the Charter and
                            within the definitions contained in the Four Power Statement and the
                            United States has consistently taken this position whenever the question
                            has arisen. The United States believes that it would be desirable by
                            consultation among the permanent members, to secure agreement on the
                            procedural nature of these decisions.</p>
                        <p>As indicated above, the procedural character of the decisions covered in
                            the first conclusion is based exclusively on the interpretation of the
                            Charter. The second conclusion of the Report, on the other hand, is
                            based on a different criterion; under this conclusion the General
                            Assembly would recommend to the permanent members of the Security
                            Council that they agree that 21 of the possible decisions of the
                            Security Council be adopted by the vote of any seven members regardless
                            of whether the decisions are considered procedural or non-procedural. It
                            is expressly pointed out in the Report that the recommendations with
                            reference to these decisions should not be considered as an expression
                            of opinion on the question whether or not these decisions are procedural
                            or non-procedural.</p>
                        <p>The sole basis for the selection of the decisions included in this
                            conclusion was the view that “if these decisions are taken by a vote of
                            any seven members of the Council it would improve the functioning of the
                            body and permit it, promptly and effectively, to fulfill its,
                            responsibilities under the Charter”. These 21 decisions include the
                            various decisions which the Security Council may make under Chapter VI
                            of the Charter (Pacific Settlement of Disputes) and in connection with
                            admission of States to membership in the United Nations. In most
                            instances they would not be deemed procedural under the Four Power
                            Statement. The Secretary of State has, however, on a number of occasions
                            advocated the elimination of the veto on such decisions and the recent
                            Senate resolution supports such a course.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that the recommendation based on the first conclusion
                            is directed to all members of the Security Council and if <pb n="239"
                                xml:id="pg_239" facs="0259"/>adopted it would be hoped that each
                            member of the Security Council would act accordingly. The recommendation
                            based on the second conclusion, on the other hand, is directed to the
                                <hi rend="italic">permanent</hi> members and will be put into effect
                            only if these members agree to it. In the event of the failure of the
                            permanent members to reach an agreement, these members will be free
                            within the limits of the Charter to exercise their own judgment as to
                            the vote which should govern any of the 21 decisions.</p>
                        <p>One of the 21 decisions contained in the second conclusion (No. 21)
                            recommends elimination of the veto in connection with the decision to
                            determine whether a matter is procedural. The United States believes
                            that this is desirable in order to prevent the extension of the veto to
                            fields where it was never intended to apply. However, as the United
                            Kingdom and France opposed this item and Belgium, India, the Netherlands
                            and Norway reserved their positions, the United States should acquiesce
                            in the elimination of this decision from the list of decisions in this
                            category if those nations press their opposition strongly and receive
                            substantial support in the General Assembly. The deletion of this item
                            would not constitute an affirmative General Assembly recommendation that
                            the veto be retained in connection with such a decision.</p>
                        <p>This conclusion likewise recommends the elimination of the veto in
                            connection with decisions relating to the establishment of the existence
                            of a dispute and parties to a dispute within the meaning of Article 27,
                            paragraph 3 which requires a party to a dispute to abstain from voting
                            in decisions under Chapter VI of the Charter relating to such disputes;
                            it recommends also a definition of the term “dispute” designed so as to
                            include most of the “situations” where there are parties. The United
                            States believes that the elimination of the veto in this type of
                            decision is necessary in order to give effect to the underlying
                            principle of Article 27(3) that no state shall be a judge in its own
                            cause, whether a dispute or situation, in connection with Security
                            Council decisions relating to pacific settlement.<note n="*"

                        <p>The third conclusion, which follows closely certain proposals of the
                            United Kingdom, seeks to establish by agreement among the permanent
                            members certain standards of conduct to be followed by them in dealing
                            with matters brought before the Security Council and in the exercise of
                            the veto.</p>

                        <p>The fourth conclusion is that the General Assembly recommend to the
                            Members of the United Nations that in agreements conferring functions on
                            the Security Council, such conditions of voting be provided within the
                            body as would exclude the application of the principle of unanimity.
                            This conclusion, which was based on a proposal of the representative of
                            Belgium, refers to new Security Council functions not provided for in
                            the Charter. It is in accord with a practice which developed in the
                            League of Nations and might appropriately develop in the United
                            Nations.</p>

                            press for keeping the discussions to a minimum. The chief reasons for

                            <item>The United States believes that the period during which the United
                                Nations has thus far operated under the present Charter is too brief
                                and the experience too limited to warrant the institution of an
                                amending procedure.</item>
                            <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                            <item>The United States believes that the present Interim Committee
                                conclusions may be implemented without Charter amendment, but would
                                not object to a Charter amendment on this subject. Therefore the
                                chief purpose of a Charter amendment would be to secure
                                liberalization of the voting procedure beyond that contained in the
                                Interim Committee conclusions. It is unreasonable to suppose that an
                                attempt to amend the Charter to accomplish such a result would be
                                acceptable <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0261"/>to all of the

                                permanent members, the Charter amendment could not take effect. Even
                                if ratification of a proposed Charter amendment could be obtained,
                                the amendment procedure would have the additional disadvantage of
                                “freezing” the situation with little prospect for further
                                liberalization.</item>

                        <p>3. Consultation Among the Permanent Members.</p>
                        <p>The General Assembly resolution of November 21, 1947 requested
                            consultation among the permanent members, “in order to secure agreement
                            on measures to assure the prompt and effective exercise by the Security
                            Council of its functions”. One such consultation actually took place on
                            January 11 [<hi rend="italic">19?</hi>], 1948 without any tangible
                            results. The consultation confirmed not only the reluctance on the part
                            of the Soviet Union to modify its position on the veto but disclosed
                            also a very serious disagreement among the United States and China on
                            the one hand and the United Kingdom and France on the other on such
                            issues as the desirability of eliminating the veto in decisions under
                            Chapter VI. The results of this consultation further confirmed the need
                            for a thorough comprehensive study of the problem and for a continued
                            discussion designed to bring the positions of the individual members as
                            close to each other as possible. Despite the absence of concrete results
                            from the single consultation, the door was left open for further
                            consultations.</p>
                        <p>While it was agreed that no announcement would be made at the time of the
                            consultations, nevertheless, it was recognized that it might be
                            necessary to refer to the fact that such consultations had taken place,
                            and Ambassador Austin, in his statement to the House Foreign Relations
                            Committee on May 5, 1948,<note n="2" xml:id="d162fn4">See footnote 11,
                                    <ref target="#pg_28">p. 28</ref>.</note> found it desirable to
                            make such an announcement. Under these circumstances it is appropriate
                            for the United States to make a statement along the lines of
                            recommendation 3.</p>
                        <p>The Interim Committee has now completed the comprehensive study of the
                            Security Council voting problem. The most important conclusions of the
                            Interim Committee Report are directed towards consultation among the
                            permanent members on certain specific matters. A General Assembly
                            recommendation based on this first comprehensive study of the problem
                            ever made in the United Nations and reflecting an authoritative
                            expression of the views of an overwhelming majority of the Members would
                            serve as a more effective basis for further consultations among the
                            permanent members. For these reasons the United States believes that
                            such further consultations would be <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242"
                                facs="0262"/>more likely to produce tangible results after the
                            adoption of the General Assembly recommendations rather than before and
                            no attempt was made to arrange for additional consultations.</p>
                        <p>As indicated above, two of the permanent members, France and the United
                            Kingdom, reserved their position on a number of items contained in the
                            Interim Committee Report. It might be advisable for the United States to
                            initiate without delay further conversations with the representatives of
                            France and the United Kingdom with a view to Obtaining agreement on such
                            items in the Report on which the three powers still disagree.<note n="‡"
                                xml:id="d162fn5">If feasible, the Representative of China should
                                participate in the discussions. [Footnote in the source
                                text.]</note> For this purpose it might become necessary for the
                            United States to agree to the elimination of at least some
                            controverisial items from the conclusions of the Report without of
                            course abandoning its basic position.</p>
                        <p>It might further be desirable for the United States to suggest to France,
                            the United Kingdom and China that informal talks with the U.S.S.R. might
                            be initiated at an early stage on the basis of the Interim Committee
                            paper. These talks should be designed to obtain an agreement by the
                            U.S.S.R. to future consultations among permanent members. If such an
                            agreement could be obtained, its announcement in the General Assembly
                            would be of considerable assistance to the opponents of the Argentinian
                            resolution for the convocation of a General Conference. This argument
                            might be effectively used in conversations with the Soviet Union.</p>

                            started the discussion by indicating certain “reservations” which the

                            in Tab B. Mr. Raynor attempted to ascertain just what was meant by
                            “reservations” without success. Since Mr. Jebb’s remarks indicated that
                            the United Kingdom might not wish to take any action at all with respect
                            to the veto, more extensive and careful consultation with then on the

                            amendment arises. They do not see any constructive result coming from

                        <p>Mr. Riddell stated that he hoped that the report of the Interim
                            Committee, after approval by the General Assembly, would become a guide
                            for the use of Presidents of the Security Council in ruling upon the
                            effect of votes in the Security Council. Mr. Rusk indicated that we were
                            not clear that this could be done and that we were inclined to believe
                            that the recommendations of the Interim Committee could become effective
                            in the Security Council only after the agreement referred to in the
                            recommendations of the Interim Committee itself. At the conclusion of
                            the discussion, the consensus seemed to be that the report of the
                            Interim Committee might serve as a guide for establishing new precedents
                            in the Security Council as a basis for negotiation among the permanent
                            members.</p>
                        <p>There was general agreement that the Argentine proposal with respect to
                            calling a general conference should be defeated, although Mr. Rusk
                            indicated that the tone of the United States position would undoubtedly
                            be affected by the Vandenberg resolution. The Canadians made a strong
                            point that at all costs a revisionary Conference at this time should be
                                avoided.<note n="5" xml:id="d163fn5">At a subsequent meeting in
                                Washington on September 4, which the Canadians did not attend, and
                                at which political issues confronting the United Nations were
                                chiefly discussed, with the attendance of specialists from the
                                Department of State, the subject of the problem of voting in the
                                Security Council came up: <p>“Mr. Jebb said that he had received a
                                    preliminary reaction from London to the points made on the veto
                                    question in our discussion in Ottawa. He said he thought the
                                    United Kingdom would arrive at the view that they could perhaps
                                    agree in principle to the proposals, provided they were put
                                    forward in the light of the formulation of a general guide to
                                    the Security Council. If the question is approached in the
                                    Assembly in that manner, Jebb expressed the view that the
                                    British might drop their reservation which he outlined in
                                    Ottawa. Under the circumstances Jebb did not wish to leave with
                                    us the memorandum which he had promised to give us at Ottawa
                                    outlining the reservations in detail.” (<gloss target="#t_IO1"

                        <p>Mr. Allen called me this afternoon and said that the Embassy had received
                            a telegram from the Foreign Office regarding the United <pb n="245"
                                xml:id="pg_245" facs="0265"/>Kingdom position on the veto which was
                            addressed to Jebb but, of course, arrived after his departure. It was in
                            reply to the message which Jebb sent to the Foreign Office following our
                            veto discussion in Ottawa. The telegram indicates that the British
                            maintain the two following reservations: (1) Doubt as to the wisdom of
                            applying a self-denying ordinance to Chapter VI decisions or
                            recommendations, (2) Doubt as, to the wisdom of a self-denying ordinance
                            being applied to the question of whether or not a matter is procedural
                            or non-procedural.</p>
                        <p>Subject to the two reservations enumerated above, the British see some
                            advantages in the proposals going forward to the Security Council in the
                            nature of some kind of general guide for the conduct of the Council.
                            However, the British will find it difficult to vote favorably on this
                            matter as it now stands in the form of a recommendation to the Security
                            Council. They feel that on this matter constitutional amendments are
                            involved and that the direct recommendation method would be a dubious
                            expedient. The telegram continued, however, with the statement that the
                            British might be able to support these proposals if the form in which
                            they are put up was revised so that it read along the line of urging the
                            Security Council to consider how far it would in practice be practicable
                            to follow the procedures suggested. The telegram concluded with an
                            expression that the Foreign Office believes that the practicable results
                            achieved in any event will be small but that there may be some credit to
                            be attained by supporting these veto proposals in some way, and it may
                            also have the result of further stressing Russian intransigence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Allen said that if we wanted to discuss this matter further with him
                            before the Delegation left he would be at our disposal. I told him that
                            we might possibly want to do so after our experts on the veto had
                            reviewed this information, but that I thought it likely that any further
                            or detailed discussions could await the arrival of both Delegations in
                            Paris.</p>

                        <p>At our request we met Messrs. Ordonneau and Naudit for lunch with the
                            understanding that we would discuss the veto. The representative <pb
                                n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0266"/>of France had reserved his
                            position on the conclusion of the Interim Committee that 36 decisions be
                            deemed procedural within the meaning of Article 27(2) of the Charter and
                            on a second recommendation that the permanent members of the Security
                            Council agree that 21 additional decisions should be adopted by a vote
                            of any seven members of the Council whether or not they be considered
                            procedural. Ordonneau, representing France in the Interim Committee, has
                            never gone into detail as to the reason behind these reservations and
                            stated his government’s position in one long speech in a sub-committee.
                            At the time he told us that he was speaking under strict instructions to
                            proceed cautiously and avoid offending Soviet sensibilities.</p>
                        <p>We began by speaking at some length about the veto Report of the Interim
                            Committee as we see it. We noted, the broad French reservations and
                            since Ordonneau was away from Lake Success when the Report was going
                            through the Interim Committee we had not been able to discuss the
                            technical details with “him. Beginning with Schuman’s speech in the
                            general debate, we mentioned the French concern over Soviet veto of
                            membership applications, particularly the Italian application, and also
                            his statement that the excessive use of the veto reflected the basic
                            difference, of views threatening the future of states and
                                individuals.<note n="1" xml:id="d165fn1">Robert Schuman, French
                                Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the
                                French Delegation to the General Assembly. M. Schuman’s speech was
                                made on September 28; for his remarks concerning the veto, see

                        </p>
                        <p>We felt that the French views on membership are precisely the same as
                            ours and that, therefore, this is one category of decision covered by
                            the second recommendation of the Interim Committee on which we are both
                            in agreement. With a view to seeking the largest area of agreement among
                            the permanent members, we therefore suggested that we should, with our
                            French colleagues, go over all these categories and see where we agree
                            and where we disagree with a view to reducing their broad reservations
                            to particular categories.</p>
                        <p>We spelled out the exact nature of the second recommendation and that it
                            is simply to the effect that the permanent members would attempt to
                            agree among themselves that the decisions covered by it should be taken
                            by any seven votes. We recognized that the area of agreement with the
                            Russians at this time might be small or non-existent but we would at
                            least have accomplished something by presenting to the Assembly a Report
                            on which the other four members find themselves in accord. We noted that
                            the French had a specific reservation as to Item 21.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d165fn2">See footnote 4, <ref target="#pg_243">p.
                                243</ref>.</note> We stated that we could quite understand their
                            position <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0267"/>there. We stressed
                            that there is no intention on the part of the United States to have the
                            categories covered by the second reservation regarded as accepted until
                            after there has been agreement among all of the permanent members. We
                            have always made this quite plain and have been subjected to some
                            criticism for our action as in the Czech case where we were criticized
                            by the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>Considering the first recommendation which would commit those states
                            accepting it to deem as procedural certain categories and act
                            accordingly, we would like to go through this list with the French. We
                            described it as essentially a particularization of Part I of the Four
                            Power Statement and staled that so far as we were concerned we
                            considered it as committing us to no action inconsistent with that
                            document. If our French friends felt that there are categories contained
                            in Category 1 which should not be so characterized, we would be glad to
                            reexamine this matter with them. We recalled that we had been careful to
                            state that the United States would not abandon the statement of general
                            attitude which the Four Power Statement represents until there is
                            general agreement among the five permanent members on the second
                            recommendation.</p>
                        <p>We recalled Ordonneau’s speech in which he suggested that the Report was
                            perhaps an effort to nibble away at the veto by means of the second
                            recommendation and we suggested that really this is nothing more than
                            the development of a principle similar to the abstention principle to
                            which we knew the French were sympathetic. The second recommendation
                            being completely conditioned on agreement between all the five permanent
                            members, we could see in it no attempt to do away by some indirect or
                            illegal means with the veto. At the same time, we feel that this is the
                            sound and conservative way of dealing with the problem which the
                            Argentine representatives and others want to face by calling an
                            immediate conference to amend the Charter and proceeding with such
                            amendments irrespective of Soviet acceptance. We and the French agree
                            that this is a dangerous and undesirable concept and we pointed out that
                            the way to oppose it is with a recommendation along the lines of that
                            contained in the Report. We concluded by pointing out that our own
                            policy as to the veto is clearly stated in the first objective of the
                            Vandenberg resolution and that the Report as it stands embodies that
                            objective and at the same time gives us a way for defeating the rather
                            irresponsible efforts for a dramatic way of limiting or doing away with
                            the veto.</p>
                        <p>Having listened to the above presentation, Ordonneau stated and repeated
                            that he considered the Report a sound document and that he liked it. He
                            and his colleague readily agreed to sit down with us arid go through it
                            item by item with a view to removing their general reservation <pb
                                n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0268"/>which he described as
                            precautionary taken simply to save their position for consideration at
                            this time. He stated that they would ask us to change certain decisions
                            from Category 1 to Category 2. He was asked the nature of their
                            objection to removing the veto from Chapter VI. He replied that he felt
                            this was dangerous for political purposes and recalled that all of the
                            cases handled by the Security Council except Palestine have been Chapter
                            VI matters.</p>
                        <p>As we discussed the nature of the second recommendation, Mr. Naudit
                            suggested that it was fundamentally looking toward a new Five Power
                            Statement. We agreed that once the Five Powers had accepted the second
                            recommendation it would in some particulars affect the Four Power
                            Statement and in that sense would constitute a new Five Power
                            Statement.</p>
                        <p>We then considered the tactics for presenting the suggestions to the
                            Assembly. Ordonneau suggested perhaps a joint resolution by the British,
                            French and ourselves along the lines of the Report. We agreed that this
                            would be the best way for defeating Arce’s idea for a conferee. We
                            stated that we had not conferred with other delegations on the veto
                            until we had the French views. Ordonneau asked us for dinner on Tuesday,
                            October 12, to get down to the technical questions with our papers
                            before us. He enquired whether it would be well to ask the United
                            Kingdom and we suggested that perhaps it would be better to get our own
                            position clear first, recalling that the British objections are similar
                            to the French and from our point of view it would be undesirable to face
                            two of them opposing us at the same time. We agreed further that we will
                            have to reconcile the Chinese representative to a position that may be
                            more conservative than he would like but Ordonneau suggested that the
                            Chinese position was more perhaps the personal position of Dr. Hsu than
                            his delegation’s We left the subject with the understanding that we will
                            proceed to work out a means of doing away with the French general
                            reservations and that we will confer with the British in the immediate
                            future.</p>

                        <p>We arranged for lunch with the United Kingdom men handling the veto to
                            work out what our general approach should be, bearing in mind that we
                            had previously had such a conference with the French.</p>
                        <p>Falla stated that they did not see anything particularly useful in the
                            veto paper because it was not likely that the Russians would accept any
                            part of it and nothing can be done without them. Furthermore, there is
                            little use in taking a position on these questions before one has to and
                            the whole question is academic. It might be all right to recommend the
                            report to the members, briefly ask the Russians if they agree, and in
                            the absence of such agreement let the matter rest there. The United
                            Kingdom is interested in the idea of a code of conduct in the Security
                            Council and that is probably the maximum extent of the usefulness of the
                            report. Also, the legal representatives feel that perhaps this is a back
                            door attempt to amend the Charter that will stir up the Russians
                            needlessly and give them some additional ground for claiming that we are
                            trying to take the veto away from them contrary to the agreement at San
                            Francisco. The British generally are skeptical of the classification of
                            decisions suggested by the second recommendation and think that a matter
                            must be either substantive or procedural with the possible exception of
                            the category of decision under paragraph 2, Part II, of the Four Power
                            Statement which is a “special catogory” by itself. Falla summed it up by
                            saying that the report seemed to be tilting at windmills and not
                            particularly useful and there is no reason to suppose there will be any
                            constructive result from the work in the absence of Russian
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>We addressed ourselves to this general approach and indicated our
                            positive attitude toward the Interim Committee report. In the first
                            place, we pointed out that other members have an interest in the veto
                            and this is the first time since San Francisco that the subject has been
                            discussed and their views known. We recalled that the Interim Committee
                            was charged with this task on the theory that it could produce some
                            light with less heat. Along the lines, of our conversation with the
                            French we stressed the fact that the second recommendation is something
                            that to be effective would have to be agreed upon by all five powers. We
                            recognized that it is unlikely that there will be an area of agreement
                            with the Russians now. However, the study would mean nothing except to
                            indicate substantive differences of opinion between the other four
                            powers if it were allowed to drift away with no clear action by the
                            Assembly and with broad reservations by France and the United Kingdom.
                            We pointed out that the Interim Committee discussion disclosed
                            considerable disagreement among the United States, France and China. If
                            an agreement among the four powers could be reached that would be an
                            important step forward. Moreover, the implementation of a General
                            Assembly recommendation listing proceedural <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250"
                                facs="0270"/>decisions under Category 1 would not be subject to
                            Soviet agreement. These were two general results we expect from the
                            Interim Committee work. We recalled that there is a strong movement by
                            articulate members of the Assembly to call a conference, the extremists
                            being; willing to amend the Charter and proceeding without Russian
                            participation. The way to meet this is to have something to suggest in
                            its stead. We consider that the veto report is that something of a sound
                            conservative nature and having some long term value. Furthermore, it
                            will be a useful guide when acted upon by the Assembly, in the hands of
                            each President of the Council.</p>
                        <p>We further mentioned that under the terms of the Vandenberg
                                resolution<note n="1" xml:id="d166fn1">For text of the “Vandenberg
                                Resolution,” S. Res. 239, June 11, 1948, see footnote 7, <ref
                                    target="#pg_25">p. 25</ref>.</note> this is an important
                            objective of our policy and that therefore we propose to press it.</p>
                        <p>As to the point that this is a back door method of amendment we pointed
                            to the principle of abstention which is generally accepted as a useful
                            practice. We pointed out that recommendation 2 would be effective only
                            by agreement and would therefore be a development of practice under the
                            Charter for which the principle of abstention is a precedent.</p>
                        <p>The United Kingdom representatives, while not enthusiastic, admitted that
                            the report would be useful in meeting the movement for calling a
                            conference and recognized that our local political situation committed
                            us to such a course of action. We suggested that if there were no basic
                            agreement in principle between us as to the usefulness of the Interim
                            Committee report, then there was some question in our minds as to she
                            usefulness of going through it category by category and thereby in
                            effect doing over the work of the Interim Committee. They went on to
                            observe that their reservations are limited and agreed that therefore it
                            might be possible to get together on a resolution and on general tactics
                            so that it would be worth while to go through the present report and see
                            what categories of decisions we are all in agreement upon. Then they
                            showed us a draft containing what they would like to see in such a
                            resolution. It contained some eight paragraphs rather equally balanced
                            in emphasis. Only one of them ref erred to the recommendations of the
                            Interim Committee dealing with the veto itself and that paragraph
                            suggested that the members of the General Assembly be “invited to
                            accept” the recommendations of the Interim Committee taking into account
                            the reservations made in the report and even this paragraph emphasized
                            the usefulness of the code of conduct for the Security Council which the
                            report mentions and which is also mentioned in Mr. Bevin’s speech.</p>
                        <p>We went on to discuss some of the particular categories of decisions
                            where we might want to make changes. We referred to the request for <pb
                                n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0271"/>an advisory opinion of the
                            Court now classified as a procedural matter on which a question is
                            raised. This led to a discussion of Part II of the Four Power Statement
                            and Fawcett emphasized the usefulness of the precedent in the Czech
                                case.<note n="2" xml:id="d166fn2">The reference is not altogether
                                clear. The question of Czechoslovakia was before the Security
                                Council actively in several forms during March–May 1948, and is
                                usefully described in general terms in United Nations, <hi

                                The probability is that Mr. Fawcett’s allusion was to the Security
                                Council voting on May 24, in Which the Soviet delegate, Gromyko,
                                cast two negative votes in exercise of the so-called double veto,
                                resulting in a rejection by the Council of a draft resolution
                                calling for the appointment of a sub-committee to hear “evidence,
                                statements and testimonies” concerning the recent political changes
                                in Czechoslovakia. (See bracketed note, <ref target="#pg_172">p.
                                    172</ref>.) It is possible that the reference to “the usefulness
                                of the precedent” was an allusion to the fact that some members of
                                the Security Council (as of May 1948) had thought that Mr. Gromyko
                                did not realize, the implications of his position when throughout
                                the May 24 meeting he had seemed tacitly to accept the view that no
                                ruling on voting procedure by a president of the Security Council
                                could be changed except by the affirmative vote of seven members.

                        </p>
                        <p>We concluded that there was sufficient agreement among us as to the over
                            all question and the matter of how the veto should be handled to make it
                            worth while to examine in detail the area in which we and the British
                            agree on categories of decisions. We mentioned our idea of a resolution
                            which would contain the recommendations of the report setting out each
                            category of decision under the recommendation to which it relates.</p>
                        <p>We left with the understanding that we would go on to discuss details and
                            tactics. It is clear that Falla has no real enthusiasm for the project
                            and regards its usefulness as simply a political tactic to defeat Latin
                            American movements to call a conference. However, Fawcett seemed to feel
                            that the report would be a useful document in the operations of the
                            Council and for the guidance of its President.</p>

                        <p>We discussed the Interim Committee report on the veto with Mr. Fawcett in
                            two three-hour sessions on October 20 and 21. He read us <pb n="252"
                                xml:id="pg_252" facs="0272"/>much of the Foreign Office Position
                            Paper. This substantiated what our previous talk with Falla and Fawcett
                            indicated, that the Foreign Office considers the second recommendation
                            of the report as an attempt to amend the Charter by the back door.
                            Fawcett is now convinced that all we want is a Big Five agreement not to
                            exercise the veto as to certain categories of decisions. He referred to
                            this as a self-denying ordinance, as opposed to the Foreign Office idea
                            that we were urging in effect that a negative vote should not be
                            considered a veto. Fawcett will present the matter to his delegation and
                            urge that there is no basic objection to the report.</p>
                        <p>Fawcett agreed that it would be most desirable for the Big Four to reach
                            a much wider area of agreement than that reflected in the Interim
                            Committee Report so that most if not all of the important reservations
                            made by the United Kingdom and French Governments could be eliminated.
                            However, we made it quite clear that in seeking such agreement the
                            United States could not sacrifice the principles underlying its position
                            on this subject.</p>
                        <p>Fawcett has been extremely cooperative and frank throughout the
                            discussions.</p>
                        <p>We examined all of the 98 possible Security Council decisions listed in

                            following are the tentative suggestions made by Fawcett with an Express
                            understanding that they will have to be further passed upon by the
                            Delegation:</p>

                                as a decision to investigate. Consequently, we suggested that the
                                text of these two categories might be revised so as to eliminate
                                this difficulty.</item>

                            <item>He is definitely opposed to considering as procedural the decision
                                in category 83 (request to the International Court of Justice for an
                                advisory opinion on a legal question). We agreed that since the
                                Security Council would and should abide or act in accordance with a
                                Court opinion the request for such opinion affects the substance of

                        <p>Fawcett wondered how this conclusion could be put into effect even if an
                            agreement is reached. We all agreed that in case of such agreement a
                            permanent member would simply abstain instead of voting in the negative
                            with respect to decisions falling within this conclusion whenever there
                            are seven or more affirmative votes in support of the decision. With
                            this understanding Fawcett agreed that Security Council decisions on
                            admission of a State to membership should be retained in this
                            conclusion. He had the following further comments:</p>

                            <item>He had a fundamental objection to the inclusion of category 21
                                relating to the decision whether a matter is or is not procedural.
                                He argued that this decision falls into a special category of
                                “nonprocedural” decisions within the meaning of Article 27(3). He
                                believes an agreement to eliminate the veto from this decision might
                                in effect lead to the elimination of the veto altogether; to propose
                                the inclusion of this category means in effect to propose a
                                potential complete elimination of the veto.</item>

                            <item>He did not object to category 21a (decision whether any matter
                                falls within one of the categories which the Interim Committee
                                recommends should be determined without a veto) but thinks it is not
                                particularly practical at this time since it presumes an agreement
                                with respect to the decisions in the second conclusion which cannot
                                be expected in the immediate future.</item>
                            <label>(3)</label>
                            <item>Category 22 (decision to determine whether a question is a
                                situation or a dispute for the purposes of Article 27 (3)). Fawcett
                                feels that this decision is of the same nature as the decision in
                                category 21 (see 1 above). Moreover, he does not agree that a
                                definition of a dispute championed by the United Kingdom in the
                                Interim Committee would serve any useful purpose and he hopes that
                                he will convince his Delegation to drop it.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Fawcett thought that the United Kingdom would agree to the retention of
                            most of the decisions under Chapter VI in the second conclusion. For
                            example, the United Kingdom will probably agree to the retention of
                            category 41 (calling upon the parties to settle their dispute by
                            peaceful means), category 42 (inviting the parties to continue or to
                            resume their efforts to seek a solution through peaceful means of their
                            own choice), and category 48 (recommending that a legal dispute should
                            be referred to the International Court of Justice).</p>
                        <p>Fawcett did not want to commit himself on other decisions under Chapter
                            VI until his Delegation considered the United Kingdom Position Paper in
                            the light of his views. However, he personally thought that the United
                            Kingdom might not agree to the inclusion of category 43 involving the
                            decision to investigate under Article 34. As we concluded, Fawcett
                            stated that in presenting the case to his Delegation he was faced with
                            his Government’s view that an agreement in advance on matters of this
                            sort is undesirable.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Blaisdell explained that the veto question arose this year from the
                            report of the Interim Committee on the problem of voting in the Security
                            Council. He pointed out that Committee 1 had not yet established the
                            priority of its consideration of this item, although it had been listed
                            fifth on the items allocated to Committer 1 by the President of the
                            General Assembly. He called to the attention of the Delegation the
                            relevant position paper (SD/A/C.1/135).</p>
                        <p>Mr. Stein explained that this was the third time the General Assembly had
                            considered the problem of the veto. It was a most controversial issue,
                            both because of the frequent use by the USSR of the veto (29 times) and
                            the opposition to the veto on principle of a number of small states. The
                            Interim Committee last year had been requested by the General Assembly
                            to study the veto question in detail. Its report was the result of the
                            first comprehensive study of this matter. It had taken as the basis of
                            its work 98 possible categories of decisions and had made
                            recommendations as to the voting procedure required of the Security
                            Council in each case. The staff recommendation was that the United
                            States should support the adoption of the report and recommendations of
                            the Interim Committee on the veto.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Stein then summarized the conclusions of the Interim Committee
                            Report. First, the General, Assembly should, recommend to the members of
                            the Security Council that they deem as procedural on the basis of
                            Charter interpretation 36 possible Security Council decisions. This
                            recommendation was to apply to the positions of the members, to the
                            ruling of the president in interpreting the result of a vote on such a
                            question, and also to the manner in which the members of the Security
                            Council should vote if the ruling of the president were challenged. Mr.
                            Stein explained that this recommendation was somewhat qualified in that
                            if, for example, the USSR should attempt to block the decision as to
                            whether a matter was procedural, by the so-called veto, the United
                            States should consider whether under the particular circumstances of the
                            individual case the matter was actually procedural and whether to depart
                            from the Four Power Statement at San Francisco. In other words, in cases
                            where this issue was raised, the United States would not automatically
                            take the view that the decision was carried by an affirmative vote of 7
                            members of the Council.</p>
                        <p>The second conclusion of the Interim Committee was that the Assembly
                            recommend to the permanent members of the Security Council, that they
                            agree that 21 of the possible decisions of the Council be taken by the
                            vote of any 7 members, regardless of whether the decisions are <pb
                                n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0275"/>considered procedural or
                            non-procedural. Mr. Stein pointed out that if the five permanent members
                            could agree on these 21 matters, it would improve the effectiveness of
                            the Security Council. The most important matters covered were the
                            admission of states to United Nations membership and decisions under
                            Chapter VI of the Charter, dealing with pacific settlement of disputes.
                            Mr. Stein noted that this recommendation could be implemented only by
                            agreement of all five permanent members.</p>
                        <p>There was one remaining point raised by the Interim Committee Report
                            which the Delegation should consider. It stemmed from the recommendation
                            based on an Argentine proposal that the Assembly consider whether the
                            time has come to call a general conference, provided for in Article 109
                            of the Charter, in order to amend the provisions on voting procedure.
                            Mr. Stein recommended that the United States take the position that the
                            time has not yet arrived either for a general conference or for
                            amendment to the Charter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Stein explained that the basic objective of the United States was to
                            obtain a certain liberalization of voting procedure, particularly
                            through the elimination of the veto on applications for membership and
                            peaceful settlement. He recalled that this was the position taken by the
                            United States in the General Assembly in 1947, and also was the position
                            of the so-called Vandenberg Resolution, passed by the Senate in June
                                1948.<note n="1" xml:id="d168fn1">For text, see footnote 7, <ref

                        <p>Mr. Stein noted that Britain and France had entered certain reservations
                            to the resolutions of the Interim Committee. Their particular objection
                            was to the elimination of the veto on matters involving peaceful
                            settlement. He pointed out the interest of the United States in
                            obtaining complete agreement on this matter so that there could be no
                            particular reservations entered to the action of the General
                            Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Preliminary discussions on the working level with the United Kingdom
                            Delegation had been held to explore the question whether and to what
                            extent it would be willing to drop these reservations. It seemed clear
                            that so far as pacific settlement under Chapter V [<hi rend="italic"
                                >VI?</hi>] was concerned, it would not abandon opposition to the
                            elimination of the veto, particularly with respect to initiating an
                            investigation and making recommendations as to the terms of settlement
                            of a dispute. The position paper envisaged possible United States
                            agreement to omitting some of the controversial matters from these
                            recommendations. Certainly one could not be sanguine as to the prospect
                            of rapid progress on this matter. If only the first recommendation of
                            the Interim Committee were accepted, there was good ground to believe
                            that progress <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0276"/>would be made
                            through the developments of practices and the establishment of
                            precedents. Mr. Stein emphasized, however, that there was no hope of
                            voluntary agreement by the USSR on these recommendations of the Interim
                            Committee. Nevertheless, the adoption of the recommendations by an
                            overwhelming majority would be another stage in the United States effort
                            to obtain agreement and to exert pressure by public opinion on the USSR
                            to modify its views on voting procedure. The voluntary approach seemed
                            preferable to an attempt to amend the Charter, since an amendment would
                            require Soviet ratification.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the position paper, Mr. Stein referred to the first
                            recommendation. This was that the United States should support adoption
                            of the conclusions and recommendations of the Interim Committee, but
                            should be willing to acquiesce in modifications of certain items in the
                            several categories of decisions in the event of strong opposition by
                            states such as France and the United Kingdom, who had reserved their
                            position on a number of items in the report. Mr. Stein said it would be
                            necessary for the Delegation to decide how far the United States should
                            go in acquiescing in such modifications. He pointed out that the second
                            recommendation, dealing with the question of convocation of a general
                            conference and taking the line that the time has not yet arrived for
                            such a conference, followed the Vandenberg Resolution in principle. The
                            third recommendation related to consultation among the permanent
                            members, as recommended by the General Assembly last year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dulles said this problem was in a sense academic in that it was quite
                            certain that the USSR would not accept any modification of the present
                            voting procedure. In other words, the Assembly’s consideration would
                            probably have no positive results. However, from the psychological
                            standpoint he believed the matter was far from academic since a strong
                            sentiment existed in other countries and in the Congress that something
                            should be done to modify the veto. For this reason, if nothing were
                            done, the United States would be subject to serious criticism. He
                            pointed out that both the Interim Committee’s Report and the so-called
                            Vandenberg Resolution contemplated giving up the veto entirely on all
                            matters under Chapter VI. It now seemed that the British and French
                            would not go along on this particular, as regarded investigation and
                            substantive recommendations. He said he had some sympathy for their
                            viewpoint because ah investigation, for example, could be a serious
                            affair if it involved sending a commission to a state which did not wish
                            to receive it. If there was to be a veto at all, there was a good deal
                            of justification for it in this case. He pointed out that these states
                            were concerned lest such commissions be sent into colonial territories,
                            for instance, to take testimony; also the personnel of such a commission
                            might include Soviet representatives.</p>
                        <pb n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0277"/>
                        <p>Mr. Dulles told the Delegation that he had cabled Senator Vandenberg last
                            night for his views as to whether he would consider it practical to meet
                            the British and French views to this extent in order to get four power
                            agreement. It seemed to Mr. Dulles important to keep a united four power
                            front. He had also said in his cable that if the United States were to
                            apply pressure at the top it might get the British and French to recede
                            from this position. There were, however, so many more urgent matters on
                            which such pressure might be required that he was reluctant to use it in
                            this case. He suggested that the Delegation’s decision should be guided
                            by Senator Vandenberg’s reaction to this cable. If the Senator did not
                            think it wise to make these concessions, the Delegation could review the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Jessup said that in the first place he agreed that it would be
                            desirable to get an alignment with the British and French. In any such
                            agreement with the British and French, however, the United States should
                            remain in a position where it could reserve its freedom of action in
                            debate to say that it was willing to go further in the discussion of
                            liberalizing the voting procedure but in the interest of agreement had
                            accepted a median position. He raised a question as to the
                            interpretation of recommendation on the Interim Committee conclusion
                            with respect to the 36 procedural decisions. Under this recommendation,
                            the United States was to consider if there was any objection in a
                            particular case, whether the matter was covered in the Four Power
                            declaration of San Francisco and would examine on its merits the
                            question whether a motion was adopted despite a Soviet veto. He felt
                            that the United States was going to be in a bad position if this issue
                            arose. The United States would obviously be in a key position to
                            determine how a vote should be interpreted. If it receded from the
                            position established by the Assembly resolution in favor of the Four
                            Power Declaration there might be serious consequences. He thought this
                            was a dangerous position, and not a courageous attack upon the real
                            problem. He wondered whether it was the intention of the United States
                            to make clear in the Assembly the limitation which it placed upon the
                            language of the Interim Committee recommendation. Otherwise, he feared
                            we would be charged with backing away from the action of the General
                            Assembly which we had supported. He pointed out that the whole
                            activities of the Interim Committee, and this report, in particular,
                            were very largely the production of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cohen said he wanted to support Mr. Jessup’s position most strongly.
                            As he saw it, the issue was how far the United States should take the
                            Four Power Declaration, which was not a part of the Charter, and extend
                            it beyond the actual necessities of a situation. Once there was action
                            by the General Assembly, it seemed to him to be very serious for the
                            United States to say it disregarded the action of the Assembly in favor
                            of a mere Declaration by the four powers. (Mr. Dulles had <pb n="258"
                                xml:id="pg_258" facs="0278"/>previously pointed out that the General
                            Assembly recommendation was not legally binding.) Mr. Cohen thought it
                            was very important not to discount the value of the recommendations of
                            the Interim Committee in connection with the development of liberal
                            constitutional practice. Such trends as this might have more effect than
                            actual legal changes. He regarded the <gloss target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss>
                            reports as only a start towards finding the potentialities within the
                            Charter to eliminate the supposedly unfortunate effects of the veto. As
                            regarded the difference of opinion with the British and French, he hoped
                            their points might be met by watering down somewhat the effect of the
                            acceptance of the General Assembly of the <gloss target="#t_IC1"
                                >IC</gloss> report, rather than by cutting down its actual
                            recommendations. He suggested that at this stage it might be best to let
                            the <gloss target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss> report stand on its own feet
                            rather than get its unqualified acceptance, which might start debates on
                            details with the result that hasty decisions later to be regretted would
                            be reached. He thought there might be some possibility of changing the
                            nature of the endorsement of the report rather than to tinker with the
                            report itself.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Austin thought that a General Assembly resolution would be of
                            some help to the five permanent members. The individuals on the
                            representative level in the Council showed general timidity on this
                            matter. All his discussions had shown that the permanent members had
                            many doubts. He thought that if the Assembly could give them a little
                            courage, it would be a good thing, particularly since the majority
                            favored this liberal position.</p>
                        <p>Commenting on the remarks made by Mr. Jessup and Mr. Cohen, Mr. Dulles
                            pointed out that they developed from the recommendation that we would
                            not necessarily regard a decision on procedural matters as binding on us
                            in the future. This would be contrary to the Four Power Statement. While
                            it was quite true that this statement was not regarded as a legally
                            binding declaration, the United States feeling free to depart from it,
                            there was considerable legal foundation in the interpretation in the
                            Declaration, since it was made when the Charter was being drafted. He
                            saw no reason why we should let a General Assembly resolution bind us
                            since the Assembly had no power to make binding interpretations of the
                            Charter. He saw no reason why, as a permanent member, the United States
                            should give up its own responsibility in this regard. The Assembly
                            resolution would have no more legal status than the Four Power
                            Declaration we should not expect to comply literally, but should be free
                            to look the situation over.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cohen doubted whether there was much difference of opinion between
                            Mr. Dulles and himself. Directing his attention first to the <pb n="259"
                                xml:id="pg_259" facs="0279"/>weight to be given to action by the
                            General Assembly as against the Four Power Statement, he agreed that the
                            United States would not be absolutely bound in either case. He had
                            intended only to say that greater weight should be given to the action
                            of the Assembly. In the second place, quite apart from the Four Power
                            Declaration, as a matter of principle, he thought the United States
                            should give the greatest weight to the General Assembly resolution,
                            although it would obviously not be absolutely legally binding upon the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Jessup said that, in effect, if the resolution were adopted, the
                            question is put up to the United States to accept these interpretations
                            as the guide it will follow in its conduct in the Security Council.
                            Voting for the resolution we would say we regarded the resolution in
                            this light. Then a case might come along, and we would think that this
                            position might antagonize the USSR so we review the case on its merits
                            in the light of the Four Power Declaration. He thought it was necessary
                            to be very careful as to the kind of statement we made. Either we should
                            water down, in our statements before the vote, the nature of the
                            recommendation, or we would subsequently be in a position of going back
                            on the resolution we had voted for.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked Mr. Cohen to elaborate his remarks with respect to
                            the first recommendation 1 as to what he meant by “watering down” action
                            on the report of the Interim Committee. Mr. Cohen said he was thinking
                            of the problem which would arise if, in line with the Four Power
                            Declaration and contrary to the Vandenberg Resolution, the United States
                            should not insist on the elimination of the veto in matters of pacific
                            settlement. He would prefer to see the Assembly simply take note of the
                            report of the Interim Committee, commend it for its work, and ask the
                            various organs of the United Nations to give consideration to its work.
                            He was simply throwing out this idea as a possible alternative avenue of
                            approach.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Austin inquired whether the United States would be presented
                            with a resolution covering the entire report, or whether it would be
                            able to consider the various recommendations in separate resolutions.
                            Mr. Dulles replied that the Interim Committee had made a global
                            recommendation. The remaining problem was the means of giving effect to
                            the <gloss target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss> report; should the resolution
                            follow the <gloss target="#t_IC1">IC</gloss> report or, to achieve four
                            power unanimity, should some modifications be made? He pointed out that
                            the first recommendation dealt with the question whether the Assembly
                            Resolution should modify or wholly reflect the recommendations of the
                            Interim Committee with respect to matters under Chapter VI. The paper
                            recommended that an attempt <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0280"/>be
                            made to achieve four-power agreement even if it should involve
                            modification of the Interim Committee Report. There were the 36
                            decisions on which we would follow the recommendations of the Interim
                            Committee completely. On the additional 21, where matters of substance
                            were involved, we might leave out two in the interest of four power
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Stein stated that the British would prefer a general resolution along
                            the line suggested by Mr. Cohen. Such a resolution would simply note the
                            report of the Interim Committee with approval. That approach, of course,
                            did not follow the recommendation of the Interim Committee. As he saw it
                            there were three alternatives. There could either be a general
                            resolution, taking note of the Interim Committee’s Report, or the
                            resolution could approve the totality of the recommendations of the
                            Interim Committee, or the resolution could approve some of the
                            recommendations of the Interim Committee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rusk said he felt that if the Dulles argument were followed, of
                            taking something less than the full position of the United States, he
                            hoped it could be put in such a way that it would not appear that the
                            United States had receded from its position. Mr. Dulles agreed that this
                            would be indispensable since it had repeatedly been stated the United
                            States was willing to forego the use of the veto on everything under
                            Chapter VI. The terms of the Vandenberg Resolution had made this
                            position even stronger. Mr. Rusk noted that the Senate had even wanted
                            to include Articles 39 and 40 in the group to which the veto should not
                            apply.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wilcox pointed out that the Senate resolution was couched in very
                            general terms. It suggested the elimination of the veto with respect to
                            peaceful settlement of disputes. The Senate Committee had not stated the
                            various categories of decisions. It obviously could not do so within the
                            limits of a one-page resolution. The Senate Resolution, however, did
                            stress the fact that the agreement reached should be voluntary,
                            presumably among the great powers first. For that reason, Mr. Wilcox
                            thought that whatever position the Delegation finds desirable to achieve
                            these ends over a period of years would be a reasonable approach in
                            accordance with the intent of the Senate Resolution.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that no decisions should be made until an answer was
                            received from Senator Vandenberg.<note n="1" xml:id="d168fn2">In

                            United States that the question of amendment of the Rule 149 of the
                            Assembly’s Rules be put on the agenda for this fall (A/582, 22
                            July).</p>
                        <p>After checking with Bill Hall in the Department, I spoke to Mr. Kyrou on
                            July 23 and told him that as he knew, the United States had consistently
                            held to the principle that no Member of the United Nations should
                            contribute more than one-third of the budget of the Organization.
                            Committee 5 had considered this matter last year and voted to postpone
                            further consideration for a year. We wanted to make very sure that this
                            item was reconsidered at the General Assembly this fall and we very much
                            hoped that the principle of the maximum one-third contribution might at
                            least be established. This does not, of course, necessarily mean that we
                            might not be willing to continue for another year our somewhat larger
                            contribution.</p>

                            United States had accepted an allocation of 39.89% (a reduction over the
                            earlier recommendation of the Committee on Contributions) on the
                            understanding, however, that this allocation was on a temporary basis,
                            as the result of war dislocation. At that time the United States had
                            made clear its feeling that no member should pay more than 33⅓% of the
                            total budget.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Webb, the United States Member on the Contributions Committee, had
                            advised Mr. Hall that the Contributions Committee found it difficult to
                            work toward the establishment of an actual ceiling principle. (The
                            United States, for its part, had not agreed that its present 39.89%
                            contribution was a ceiling.) Mr. Webb had confidentially advised him
                            that the Contributions Committee had been considering whether to ask the
                            Assembly to determine whether the present allocations, in fact,
                            constituted ceilings.<note n="1" xml:id="d173fn1">Recommendations to the
                                General Assembly for the allocation of assessments on Member States

                                the Committee on Contributions, a permanent standing committee of
                                the General Assembly made up of ten members elected by the General
                                Assembly on a personal basis for 3-year terms. For the relevant
                                report of the Committee on Contributions (United Nations document

                        </p>
                        <p>The recommendation of the staff was for the adoption of the 33⅓% ceiling
                            principle. In addition, the staff recommendation favored seeking <pb
                                n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0289"/>at least a token reduction in
                            the United States contribution this year. (Actually if national income
                            were to be the determining factor, the United States share would be
                            about 56%.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hall noted that the Eastern European states had not furnished
                            necessary data on national income figures, so that it was impossible for
                            the Committee on Contributions to work out the scale of contributions on
                            a strictly statistical basis.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether the Soviet Union had taken a strong stand on
                            enforcing the present contribution on the United States. Mr. Hall
                            replied that the U.S.S.R. had accepted a slight increase over the amount
                            initially recommended by the Committee on Contributions at the time the
                            original allocations were fixed. However, the Soviet member of the
                            Contributions Committee had accused the United States of attempting to
                            reduce its share of the budget at the expense of other countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dulles asked if it was correct that the fair quota of the United
                            States on a <hi rend="italic">per capita</hi> basis was 56% in which
                            case the United States would have a greater <hi rend="italic">per
                                capita</hi> income than over one-half the world. Mr. Hall said this
                            was correct.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Thorp pointed out that it was important to remember that most
                            contributions to the United Nations were paid in dollars and the United
                            States was naturally in a better position to pay dollar exchange.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if the Delegation favored the proposal for the
                            acceptance of a ceiling principle. Mr. Dulles asked whether this meant
                            the United States contribution would be reduced this year to 83⅓%. Mr.
                            Hall replied that the actual allocation would be worked out by the
                            Contributions Committee. Mr. Rusk noted that at the present time the
                            Contributions Committee did not consider that the application of the
                            ceiling principle was within its terms of reference. Mr. Hall stated
                            that the 33⅓% would simply be a target for the Contributions Committee
                            to work toward, as new members were admitted, and the assessments of
                            other members were revised on the basis of new information. He felt
                            that, if action were not taken on the ceiling principle now, the United
                            States might expect to have a 39.89% contribution in perpetuity. He
                            noted that the Congress was anxious to have the United States work
                            toward some reduction, and that the Appropriations Committee in
                            particular felt the present contributions system is unsound. Ambassador
                            Austin indicated that, in defending the budget justifications before the
                            Congress, he had promised that the United States would make an effort
                            toward establishing a ceiling on contributions, though there was little
                            hope of an actual immediate reduction in the United States assessment.
                            He believed the Delegation had a commitment to Congress to seek such a
                            reduction.</p>
                        <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0290"/>
                        <p>Mr. Gross emphasized that there was no assurance at the present time that
                            the United States contribution would not be increased beyond 39.89%. He
                            suggested that extreme caution should be used in presenting our proposal
                            since there were two inconsistent objectives to be harmonized: capacity
                            to pay and the sovereign equality of states. Obviously, if a state paid
                            a disproportionate share it was possible that it might exercise
                            disproportionate control of the organization. He noted that it was
                            difficult to get an equitable <hi rend="italic">pro rata</hi> of
                            contributions without fuller statistical data. After emphasizing that he
                            was not speaking for the Committee on Foreign Relations, Mr. Wilcox said
                            that there was a strong feeling in the Senate that it was undemocratic
                            for one state to contribute so much to the budget of the United Nations
                            because it might tend to lead to domination of the organization or
                            charges of alleged domination by such a state.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rusk pointed out that it would be possible for the United States to
                            submit published statistics of the U.S.S.R., upon which an increase in
                            the Soviet contribution could legitimately be based, and because of
                            which the United States contribution could be reduced. Such a move,
                            however, might be unwise politically. He indicated that United States
                            information shows that Soviet capacity to pay has increased, and noted
                            that the U.S.S.R. has been telling its own citizens of increased
                            national wealth. He thought there was no question that the United States
                            could get the necessary votes to raise the Soviet contribution;
                            nevertheless, he would recommend against such action because of the
                            broad political problem involved.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hall pointed out that there was a related problem, as it seemed
                            highly probable that there would be an operational budget for the United
                            Nations Guard and for the Palestine Commission or other political
                            commissions which may be set up. It appeared from the positions already
                            taken by certain of the smaller states that the Five Major Powers might
                            be required to bear a major share of such an operational budget.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sandifer pointed out the tendency of the specialized agencies to
                            regard the United Nations scale of contributions as the standard for
                            their own budgets. He had met that tendency head-on in the World Health
                            Organization Assembly, in working out the World Health Organization
                            contributions scheme, and there had been a complete blockade against any
                            effort to allocate to the United States a quota smaller than that which
                            it paid to the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Roosevelt thought the total figures of the United States
                            contributions to international agencies would be of considerable
                            importance, noting that the U.S.S.R. pays a much smaller percentage
                            share. She inquired whether this point could not be brought out. Mr.
                            Hall <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0291"/>said that the Department
                            of State submitted a consolidated appropriation covering United States
                            participation in international organizations. Only the contribution to
                            the IRO had been treated separately. The total cost was approximately
                            $128,000,000, exclusive of the International Children’s Emergency Fund,
                            with the contribution to the IRO the largest single item. He noted that
                            the U.S.S.R. belongs only to the WHO and to the United Nations, and in
                            both cases pays approximately 6% of the budgets.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked for Delegation approval of the proposal for the
                            establishment of a ceiling principle. It was agreed. He then asked
                            whether the Delegation approved the proposal for 33⅓% ceiling for the
                            United States contribution. This was also approved. Turning to the final
                            recommendation that the United States should seek a reduction in its
                            share of the 1949 budget, the Secretary asked whether that was
                            advisable. Mr. Rusk said it seemed important to try for at least a token
                            reduction.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dulles felt that the United Nations had not adequately explored the
                            possibility of accepting payment in currency other than dollars. He
                            thought it would be useful if some states were permitted to pay in their
                            own currency and thought that the United Nations could use such currency
                            in connection with its own work. Mr. Rusk pointed out that there had
                            already been a start made in this direction, that the Assembly last year
                            had authorized the Secretary-General to accept a certain number of
                            French francs, Swiss francs and Dutch guilders, but agreed that the
                            possibilities had not been fully explored.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hall said he had discussed this matter with the Treasury which took
                            the view that the United States already had large credits abroad and
                            which was, therefore, reluctant to accept others for liquidation before
                            its own. The International Monetary Fund would grant short-term dollar
                            credits. However, neither the Bank nor the Fund regarded long-term
                            credit as commercially sound. Mr. Hall observed that the proposed United
                            Nations Guard might be based in Europe, in which case the United Nations
                            could use more European currency.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gross stated that undoubtedly the United Kingdom would oppose the
                            United States on this issue, and thought it was unfortunate. Mr. Hall
                            explained that the British felt that they have been over-assessed as
                            compared with the U.S.S.R. and the United States, this opinion stemming
                            from the British Treasury view that the United Kingdom must conserve
                            every dollar. Mr. Ross indicated that Canada also felt it had been
                            over-assessed but had nevertheless indicated a willingness to help the
                            United States a little in this situation. The Delegation approved the
                            recommendation to work toward a reduction in the United States budget
                            this year.</p>

                        <p>The United States Delegation should support adoption of the two
                            resolutions, which are proposed by Committee 5, without comment, if that
                            is proposed by the President of the Assembly. If some Delegation should
                            oppose the report, it will be necessary for the United States to speak.
                            Such opposition is not anticipated inasmuch as the Report and the
                            resolutions were adopted unanimously, with 5 abstentions.</p>

                                    conclusion of his statement Mr. Gross emphasized that</p>
                                <p>“… his Government was not asking for a ceiling of 33.33 per cent
                                    to be adopted for 1949 nor even for several years to come; it
                                    was merely suggesting that the General Assembly should adopt
                                    that ceiling as a directive for the Committee on Contributions.
                                    That ceiling would be operative as soon as economic conditions
                                    and the admission of new members made it possible. The General
                                    Assembly should make a decision on that point during the present
                                    session, as the Committee on Contributions, in its report, had
                                    expressed a desire for detailed instructions regarding its terms
                                    of reference in connexion with the ceiling to be fixed for
                                    contributions.” (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., p. 76)</p>

                        <p>The draft resolutions submitted to the Plenary are the product of a
                            series of meetings held by a Committee 5 Working Party of 13, plus Mr.
                            Martinez-Cabanas, Chairman of the Committee on Contributions. The
                            Working Party considered the Report of the Committee on Contributions,
                            which recommended continuation of the 1948 scale with minor adjustments
                            in 1949, and the proposal of the United States Delegation that a ceiling
                            of 33.33 percent should apply to contributions to the administrative
                            budget in normal times.</p>
                        <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0294"/>
                        <p>The final resolution proposed by Committee 5 is a compromise between the
                            United States position that a one-third ceiling for normal times should
                            be fixed at once and a majority view that a definite ceiling should not
                            be fixed time. The compromise represents many hours of discussion in the
                            Working Party and Committee 5, and gives Substantial recognition to the
                            United States position. It adopts the policy that a ceiling on
                            contributions should apply and establishes a presumption in the preamble
                            that the ceiling will be fixed in normal times at 33.33 percent.</p>
                        <p>The second resolution proposed by Committee 5 approves the 1949 scale as
                            recommended by the Committee on Contributions. It is the same as the
                            1948 scale except that it adjusts the assessments for the United Kingdom
                            and Sweden to take account of the addition of Burma to the list of
                            contributors.</p>
                        <p>Thus, the proposed resolutions satisfy the most important objectives of
                            the original instructions, as modified by the Delegation: <list>

                        the United Nations by the administering authorities under Article 73(<hi

                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. Gerig explained that the question of the future status of Southwest
                        Africa had been discussed at every session of the Assembly. It was
                        essentially the question of annexation vs. trusteeship. He pointed out that
                        the Assembly’s decision on this matter may affect the continued membership
                        of the Union of South Africa in the United Nations. He noted that Southwest
                        Africa was the last of the former League mandates outside the United
                        Nations.</p>
                    <p>There were some 40,000 Europeans in the territory who favored its
                        incorporation in the Union of South Africa as a fifth province. In addition
                        there was a native population of some 350,000. The territory <pb n="276"
                            xml:id="pg_276" facs="0296"/>was strategically located and if it were
                        incorporated into the Union, it would enclose several territories under the
                        administration of a High Commissioner, such as Bechuanaland. He pointed out
                        that this case was also related to the racial policies of the Union
                        government and had been tied by the Indian Delegation to the question of the
                        treatment of the Indians in South Africa.<note n="4" xml:id="d177fn4">The
                            continuing dispute at the United Nations between India and South Africa,
                            concerning the alleged discrimination by the Union Government against
                            the Indian minority in South Africa, was essentially a human rights
                            question. Generally the United States had adopted the position that the
                            best approach to the problem was bilateral, with direct negotiations
                            between India and South Africa. Underlying this view was the opinion of
                            the successive U.S. delegations involved, that probably the question of
                            domestic jurisdiction was implicated here, as set forth in Article 2(7)
                            of the Charter of the United Nations: <p>[Article 2] “7. Nothing
                                contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations
                                to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic
                                jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit
                                such matters to settlement under the present Charter; but this

                                measures under Chapter VII.”</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>In the past the United States had worked for a moderate resolution, and
                        despite pressure for radical action, satisfactory resolutions had been
                        adopted. One of the main difficulties encountered was the fact that many
                        states believed there was a positive obligation under the Charter of the
                        United Nations for a state to submit a Trusteeship Agreement for a territory
                        such as Southwest Africa. While the United States took the view that such
                        action was desirable, it did not regard it as obligatory.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gerig referred to a statement by the Smuts Government<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d177fn5">Jan Christiaan Smuts, South African statesman, and one
                            of the founders of the Union of South Africa, was Prime Minister of the
                            Union in 1947.</note> in 1947 that it would continue to govern the
                        territory in the spirit of the mandate, South Africa had also reported to
                        the United Nations Administration but had refused to send a representative
                        to discuss the report with the Trusteeship Council. The Union Government,
                        however, had answered a series of written questions and its cooperation had
                        been relatively good.</p>
                    <p>The question now was whether for the third time the Assembly should express
                        its view that Southwest Africa should be placed under the Trusteeship
                        System. It seemed clear that the Assembly should not for the third time urge
                        the Union Government to submit a Trusteeship Agreement, which request would
                        certainly be ignored. Mr. Gerig believed that there was some question
                        whether the new Union Government<note n="6" xml:id="d177fn6">This is a
                            reference to the government of Daniel F. Malan which came into office in
                            May 1948. Dr. Malan was both Prime Minister and Minister for External
                            Affairs.</note> would be willing to continue the policy of reporting on
                        the Administration of this territory. South Africa was very sensitive on <pb
                            n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0297"/>this matter, and certainly if a
                        critical resolution were adopted by the Assembly, even this token
                        cooperation would probably be brought to an end. Such a critical resolution
                        would also be useful to the Nationalist Group in the Union who were urging
                        withdrawal from the United Nations. Mr. Gerig incidentally noted that the
                        Chief of the South African Delegation<note n="7" xml:id="d177fn7">E. H.
                            Louw, South African Minister of Mines and Economic Development.</note>
                        was one of the original exponents of the annexation of Southwest Africa. Mr.

                        he doubted whether the new government would submit information on Southwest
                        Africa.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he was aware that South Africa felt very strongly on this
                        matter and he thought the United States should be very clear about its
                        position. Since time was growing short, he suggested that further action be
                        deferred and the recommendations be discussed as the first order of business
                        at the next meeting of the Delegation.<note n="9" xml:id="d177fn9">The
                            question of South West Africa was discussed only briefly at the meeting

                            position paper (SD/A/C.4/49 or US(P)/A/C.4/1, dated September 8, 1948,

                        Gerig)</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gerig recalled that this matter had been previously discussed by the
                        Delegations, and it had been agreed that discussions should be had with
                        representatives of the Union of South Africa to see just what their
                        intentions were with respect to the territory. Mr. Sayre and Mr. Dulles had
                        held conversations with members of the Union Delegation in which it had been
                        learned that the Union government would not submit a trusteeship agreement
                        and would not continue to transmit general reports to the Trusteeship
                        Council. South Africa’s reasons for this policy were not too clear, although
                        reference had been <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0298"/>made to the
                        strategic position of the territory, and to the examination of the reports
                        by the Trusteeship Council on which the U.S.S.R. was represented. The
                        U.S.S.R was alleged to have considerable influence on both the Indian and
                        native populations in Southwest Africa and for this reason the Union
                        government desired to cut off all relations with the United Nations. Mr.
                        Gerig thought it would be very difficult for the United States to prevent
                        the most drastic action on this subject this year.</p>
                    <p>In personal conversation with one of the South African representatives, it
                        had been learned that two years ago Smuts had been urged by his advisors to
                        submit a trusteeship agreement. The new government, of course, had an
                        entirely different view, although the disadvantages of taking a line of
                        unnecessary rudeness toward the United Nations had been brought to its
                        attention. This South African representative had hinted that it might be
                        appropriate for the United States to make an approach to the Union Prime
                        Minister, asking for a change of policy. The matter had been discussed with
                        Mr. Dulles, who felt it would commit the United States too deeply. For this
                        reason, the best line of action seemed to be to persuade the Union Delegates
                        to leave some loophole in their presentation to the Assembly of the problem
                        of Southwest Africa. Then, after the debate was concluded, it might be
                        possible to work out an acceptable compromise.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Sayre said that this was a most delicate and difficult situation.
                        While the United States could argue that the Union government had no legal
                        obligations to submit a trusteeship agreement, it could not defend its
                        refusal to submit general information reports, particularly in view of last
                        year’s undertaking to this effect. Moreover, Southwest Africa was a former
                        League of Nations mandated territory and the U.N. might be said to have a
                        continuing interest by reason of the territory’s international status.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sayre also pointed out that under the Charter, even nations with
                        sovereign rights over non-self-governing territories were required to submit
                        reports; it was under those circumstances, for example, that the United
                        States submitted data on Puerto Rico, Alaska, and Hawaii. He thought that,
                        if South Africa refused to submit information there would be a violent
                        explosion in Committee 4. He agreed it was wise not to approach the Prime
                        Minister on this matter but believed that the Union representatives should
                        be persuaded not to take an out and out position on this matter at the
                        outset of the debate.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Austin asked whether the recommendations in the position paper
                        were still valid. Ambassador Sayre indicated that they were. Mr. Gerig said
                        it might be necessary to reconsider the recommendations in the light of the
                        position taken by South Africa in the debate, but even in this case the
                        United States would probably merely <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0299"
                        />wish, to sharpen the position taken in the paper, to the effect that the
                        Union government was legally required to submit reports on the
                        territory.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Roosevelt was not very optimistic about the South African position,
                        recalling that in the discussion of the Declaration of Human Rights in
                        Committee 3, the Union representative had made it clear that it believed a
                        government had the right to discriminate in any way against any part of its
                        population. She doubted that South Africa would be at all accommodating in
                        this matter.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Austin stated that the position paper was approved by the
                        Delegation. As regarded the question of approaching the Prime Minister, the
                        Delegation would oppose such a move. On the suggestion of Mr. Cohen,
                        however, it was agreed that the United States should continue to make clear
                        the strength of its own opinion on this subject.</p>

                    <p>The United States should vote in favor of Resolution II which was recommended
                        by the Special Committee on Information under Article 73(e) of the Charter
                        and adopted by Committee 4 after Polish, Brazilian, and Soviet amendments
                        had been defeated.</p>
                    <p>This resolution provides for the continuation of a Special Committee for 1949
                        with the same balanced membership and terms of reference as this year’s
                        committee, while leaving open the question of whether there will be any
                        Special Committee after 1949.</p>
                    <p>It may be necessary for the United States Delegation to speak in support of
                        this resolution in view of the large amount of support in Committee 4 for a
                        permanent committee or for its establishment for a longer period than one

                    <p>The present text of Resolution II, together with a fourth paragraph later
                        deleted in Committee 4 as superfluous, was adopted by the Special Committee
                        11–1 (USSR)–3 (Belgium, Colombia, France) as a compromise, which the United
                        States Delegation initiated, between certain, administering members (United
                        Kingdom, Belgium, France) who <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0300"
                        />wanted to eliminate the Special Committee this year, and certain
                        non-administering members (including China and India) who wished it
                        constituted on a permanent basis. With the drafting deletion noted above,
                        Committee 4 approved the text recommended by the Special Committee by a vote
                        of 38–7 (Slav States and Argentina) but only after the Polish and Brazilian
                        amendments had been defeated by rather narrow margins.</p>
                    <p>The Polish amendment, which was originally submitted jointly by Cuba and
                        Venezuela, withdrawn by them, and then adopted by the Polish Delegation,
                        provided for the establishment of the Special Committee on a permanent
                        basis. This amendment was lost by a tie vote (17–17 with 18 abstentions), 9
                        Latin American States voting for the Polish amendment and 5 abstaining.</p>
                    <p>The Brazilian amendment constituting the Special Committee for three years
                        was lost by 11 votes to 19 with 21 abstentions, 8 of the votes for the
                        amendment being cast by Latin American States.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet amendment to substitute for the present paragraph 2 a text which
                        would invite the Special Committee to examine the information transmitted on
                        the development of self-government, data supplied by the Specialized
                        Agencies, and information transmitted to the Secretary-General by private
                        persons, local groups or organizations and to prepare appropriate
                        recommendations thereon for the General Assembly was defeated by 26 votes to
                        8 (Slav States, Colombia, Guatemala) with 17 abstentions.</p>

                    <p>The first resolution dealt with the method of transmitting information under
                        Article 73(e) and was intended to improve the existing procedures. Mr. Gerig
                        noted in particular the provisions of Paragraph 3 of this resolution which
                        authorized the Secretary General “to include in his summaries and analyses
                        all relevant and comparable official statistical information”. He explained
                        that this would enable the Secretary General to make comparisons between,
                        for example, health expenditures in other countries in the same area. He
                        recommended that this resolution be supported, unless the USSR should
                        propose amendments going beyond its present terms. He explained that the
                        USSR would like to require the submission of political information, and in
                        this connection noted that a Soviet proposal, which would have required such
                        political information and would have permitted information to be submitted
                        from private persons and local groups or organizations, had been defeated in
                        the Committee.<note n="3" xml:id="d180fn3">This situation is briefly
                            described in the Committee’s report, <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>

                                Third Session, Part I, Fourth Committee</hi>.</note> He pointed out
                        that the adoption of such a requirement would wipe out the distinction
                        between a colony and a trust territory. The British and French regarded such
                        a provision as absolutely unacceptable for that reason. As the resolution
                        stood, however, it would require only a simple majority vote.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Jacobs inquired whether the USSR furnished any information on the
                        territories which it had taken over from Japan, in particular the Kurile
                        Islands and southern Sakhalin. Mr. Gerig said the Soviets had submitted no
                        information, a fact which the British had pointed out. These territories,
                        however, had been handed over to the USSR at Yalta, and the USSR would not
                        admit any responsibility to treat them as non-self-governing territories.
                        Mr. Cohen did not see how that followed. Mr. Dulles said the USSR contended
                        these territories were fully self-governing. Mr. Gerig indicated that the
                        USSR would say, if this point were raised, that they were part of its
                        metropolitan domain. Mr. Cohen commented that the USSR always strongly
                        opposed <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0302"/>the incorporation of
                        territories by other states into the metropolitan area, and wondered if it
                        was not exposed in this case and should be made to answer for its own
                        contrary situation. There was nothing in the Yalta arrangement as to how the
                        USSR should govern these territories, and he noted that he had seen no
                        Soviet decrees giving them the status of republics. Mr. Gerig indicated
                        there might be a possibility of making some proposals on this matter.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked for the Department’s views on this matter. Mr. Gerig
                        explained that it was not ready to put forward any specific proposal because
                        there was some question as to whether we had not agreed that these
                        territories were part of Russian territory handed back to the USSR. No final
                        decision had been taken, however. Mr. Cargo stated that the research
                        divisions of the Department had been requested to make a study as to whether
                        the USSR and also India might not have territories which could be classed as
                        non-self-governing. The opinion drawn from these studies was that neither
                        country had such territories.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Roosevelt expressed interest in the defeated Soviet proposal which would
                        have permitted the transmission of information from individual groups. She
                        thought the citizens of a country should have the right to petition, but
                        noted that in the case of petitions received by the Human Rights Commission
                        from groups within the USSR, when such petitions were turned over to the
                        USSR, the Soviet Representative said they were totally lacking in validity
                        because they came from individuals or small groups. She thought that point
                        was worth remembering if the USSR made trouble on this resolution.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gerig then turned to the second resolution. He said this was more
                        important since it had to do with the setting up of a special committee.
                        This committee, like the previous committee, would be composed of the eight
                        Colonial Powers and eight other Members to balance the Colonial group. The
                        Resolution recommended the extension of the committee for an additional
                        year. He pointed out that the British, French, and Belgian Delegations would
                        like to discontinue the Special Committee because they felt its only
                        function was to work out the procedure for the transmission of information.
                        Mr. Gerig believed, however, that it was better to have a balanced
                        commission to do the initial work than to throw this information into the
                        58-Member Fourth Committee. He noted that this recommendation for the
                        continuance of the Committee was “without prejudice to the future.” A
                        proposal for a permanent committee had lost by a tie vote. If this motion
                        were re-introduced a two-thirds majority should be required. Mr. Dulles
                        asked whether the resolution in its present form required a two-thirds vote.
                        Mr. Gerig said he thought the whole resolution should be subject to
                        two-thirds rule and pointed out that last year the resolution setting up the
                        Special Committee had required a two-thirds majority.</p>
                    <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0303"/>
                    <p>Mr. Gerig explained that Paragraph 2 of the resolution [Resolution II] set
                        forth the terms of reference of the Committee. He noted that the Colonial
                        Powers were very sensitive on the question of substantive recommendations.
                        The United States, unlike the other Colonial Powers, however, did not object
                        to substantive recommendations on such matters as health and labor
                        conditions. He indicated that certain states, however, would attempt to
                        extend the scope of the Committee’s operation. In that case, the United
                        States would have to resort to the domestic jurisdiction clause of the
                        Charter. Mr. Gerig recommended that the United States support this
                        resolution.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that the recommendations as to the first resolution were
                        adopted. The Delegation would consider the second resolution at a later
                        date. Mr. Dulles indicated that he might not be present at the next meeting
                        where this would be discussed and, therefore, wanted to state that he agreed
                        with the recommendations on all five resolutions as set forth in the
                        position papers.</p>

                        report of the Fourth Committee (Mr. Gerig)</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gerig recalled that five resolutions on this matter would be considered
                        by the plenary session. The Delegation had approved the recommendation on
                        the first of these resolutions at a previous meeting.</p>
                    <p>He explained that Resolution II provided for the continuation of the Special
                        Committee, with the same terms of reference, for another year. The Soviet
                        Union might propose that it be made permanent. Mr. Gerig recommended that
                        the United States support the resolution as it stands, and oppose any
                        attempt to make the Special Committee permanent. He pointed out that the
                        colonial powers already feel this committee is likely to go too far and
                        generally opposed it. As it stood, the resolution would require a two-thirds
                        majority. Mr. Rusk noted that if no resolution obtained a two-thirds
                        majority, the matter would be referred back to Committee 4. The recommended
                        position was approved by the Delegation without further comment.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gerig then took up Resolution III which provided for better working
                        liaison between the Special Committee and the Economic and <pb n="284"

                        He recommended that the United States support the resolution. This position
                        was approved by the Delegation without comment.</p>
                    <p>Resolution IV provided for collaboration with the specialized agencies. Mr.
                        Gerig indicated it represented the general agreement of Committee 4. The
                        position that the United States should vote for the resolution was
                        accepted.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked Ambassador Austin to comment on the effect of the hearty
                        endorsement by the United States of the principle of independence for the
                        colonial peoples.<note n="1" xml:id="d181fn1">The United States had taken
                            this position consistently at the United Nations, from the first meeting
                            of the General Assembly at London in January–February 1946.</note>
                        Ambassador Austin said he was not in a position to comment. Mr. Dulles
                        states that this position was very satisfactory for the United States, but
                        also difficult because we were torn between our desire to help the colonial
                        peoples toward independence and, on the other hand, were influenced by our
                        strategic inter-dependence with the colonial powers which derived their
                        economic strength from their colonies. He noted the traditional Communist
                        position toward colonialism. This year the situation had been less acute as
                        regarded the usual attack on the colonial powers by the Soviet group and
                        states such as India, and no particularly great problems had been raised as
                        regards the United States, position. Ambassador Sayre pointed out that there
                        were two kinds of non-self-governing territories, trust territories
                        and-colonial dependencies. The United Nations was given extensive powers
                        over the trust territories, which powers were lacking as regards colonial
                        dependencies. The USSR had made a continuing effort to extend these powers
                        to non-self-governing colonial dependencies. Last year the Soviet bloc had
                        outvoted the United States at every turn, along this general line, but the
                        plenary had reversed the action of the Committee. This year the United
                        States had succeeded in getting its position across in the Committee. He
                        believed the USSR had lost its influence and noted that China and India were
                        following the lead of this country. Mr. Dulles thought the same issue might
                        appear, however, in an acute form in the consideration of the Italian
                        Colonies question.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows discussion of other subjects.]</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gross asked what significance should be attached to the change of
                        position by India and China in Committee 4. Mr. Sayre thought Soviet
                        hypocrisy had been shown up and that these States were now convinced of the
                        sincerity of the United States. Also, the Indian representation was of
                        better quality. Our policy tended to hold the balance, and in general, the
                        committee was going forward in a liberal direction. The Secretary said the
                        Chinese were afraid to take any position which might cause the Soviet Union
                        to take a more active part in Manchuria.</p>
                    <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0305"/>
                    <p>Mr. Gerig then turned to Resolution V. The main idea of this resolution was
                        to inform the United Nations whenever the colonial powers stop giving
                        information on particular territories and the reason why. He noted that two
                        years ago 74 territories were being reported on; this year there were only
                        64. The reduction could be mostly accounted for by certain French
                        territories, such as Tunis, Morocco, Vietnam and Cambodia, which had become
                        associated states of the French union. The idea of the resolution was that
                        states should inform the United Nations why they were not reporting on
                        particular territories and what the new constitutional status of such
                        territories was. He explained that, in voting for this resolution in
                        Committee 4, Ambassador Sayre had stated that it would not alter the right
                        of each state to determine the constitutional position and status of a
                        territory under its jurisdiction. This would cover such cases as a United
                        States decision to admit Alaska as a state, an action which we would not
                        admit the United Nations had any right to challenge. Mr. Gerig noted that
                        one group within the Committee would like to insist that the United Nations
                        should determine whether a state is justified in not sending in the’
                        information. The recommendation that the United States should support this
                        resolution was accepted without further comment.<note n="2" xml:id="d181fn2"

                    </p>
                    <p>Two basic resolutions were presented to the Fourth Committee on the question
                        of South West Africa—a draft resolution submitted jointly by the Delegations
                        of Denmark, Norway and Uruguay, and a second draft resolution submitted by
                        India. The joint draft resolution was subsequently revised by the three
                        Delegations to take into account certain suggestions made by the United
                        States and Greece. Although there were many points of similarity between the
                        two draft resolutions, the resolution presented by India was in stronger
                        language than the joint resolution and contained a number of recommendations
                        which the Union Government was clearly unwilling even to consider. The joint
                        resolution of Denmark, Norway, and Uruguay was drafted infirm but moderate
                        language. Its principal objective is to obtain from the Union Government
                        further reports on South West Africa for examination by the Trusteeship
                        Council.</p>
                    <p>The Indian draft resolution was withdrawn and certain portions of it were put
                        forward as amendments to the joint draft resolution. These proposed
                        amendments included a suggestion for the appointment by the Trusteeship
                        Council of a visiting commission to South West Africa. This proposal was
                        rejected by the Fourth Committee by 22 votes against, 21 in favor, and 11
                        abstentions. An amendment proposed by Cuba, by which the United Nations
                        would consider petitions from inhabitants of South West Africa, was
                        withdrawn without being put to the vote.</p>
                    <p>The joint draft resolution in the revised form, submitted by the three
                        sponsors (A/C.4/163/Rev. 1), was taken by the Fourth Committee as the basic
                        document on South West Africa. All proposed amendments to it were rejected
                        and it was adopted by the Fourth Committee by a vote of 36 to 1. The United

                    <p>It is possible, although not considered likely, that amendments will be
                        offered in the Plenary meeting, either with a view to placing more vigorous
                        language in the Resolution or with a view to weakening the <pb n="287"
                            xml:id="pg_287" facs="0307"/>Resolution. The Resolution presented by the
                        Fourth Committee, however, represents a sound middle-ground position
                        calculated to obtain from the Union Government further reports on South West
                        Africa without constituting a retreat by the Assembly from its previous
                        action on this matter. Therefore, the United States Delegation should take
                        the position in the Plenary meeting that no further changes should be made
                        in the Resolution and should vote against any amendments which may be
                            presented.<note n="2" xml:id="d182fn2">The report and recommendations of

                            State, was one of the senior advisers to the United States

                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. Sandifer noted that the general policy of the United States on this
                        subject had been established in the Secretary’s speech. Emphasis on human
                        rights would play an important part in the United States approach in this
                        Assembly in relation to the general problem of the maintenance of
                            peace.<note n="5" xml:id="d183fn5">The significance of the Secretary of
                            State’s remarks on human rights was marked by the position of the
                            statement in his general policy address to the General Assembly on
                            September 23. At the outset, after a reference to Paris as the site of
                            the meeting of the General Assembly, and to the preeminence of France as
                            a centuries-long patroness of the arts and sciences, Secretary Marshall
                            plunged into the subject, “It is entirely fitting,” he then said, “that
                            this General Assembly, meeting in France which fired the hearts of men
                            with the Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789, should consider in
                            1948 the approval of a new declaration of human rights for free men in a
                            free world.” Quickly enumerating the fundamental “rights and freedoms”,
                            Secretary Marshall then made his principal point: <p>“Systematic and
                                deliberate denials of basic human rights lie at the root of most of
                                our troubles and threaten the work of the United Nations. It is not
                                only fundamentally wrong that millions of men and women live in
                                daily terror of secret notice, subject to seizure, imprisonment, or
                                forced labor without just cause and without fair trial, but these
                                wrongs have repercussions in the community of nations. Governments
                                which systematically disregard the rights of their own people are
                                not likely to respect the rights of other nations and other people
                                and are likely to seek their objectives by coercion and force in the
                                international field.”</p>
                            <p>The Secretary of State closed this first part of his address with
                                this exhortation to the General Assembly: “Let this third regular
                                session of the General Assembly approve by an overwhelming majority
                                the Declaration of Human Rights as a standard of conduct for all;
                                and let us, as Members of the United Nations, conscious of our own
                                shortcomings and imperfections, join our effort in good faith to
                                live up to this high standard.” (Department of State <hi

                    <p>Turning to the background of the Declaration on Human Rights, Mr. Sandifer
                        explained that it had been prepared in the Human Rights Commission under the
                        chairmanship of Mrs. Roosevelt. This Commission had been instructed to
                        prepare a draft International Bill of Human Rights.<note n="6"

                            and August 8, 1948, pp. 159 ff. The latter has texts of drafts of the
                            Declaration prepared at the second and third sessions of the Commission
                            on Human, Rights.</note> It had prepared this declaration for approval
                        by the General Assembly as a standard of conduct involving human rights. The
                        Commission was also working on a covenant on human rights, which would be
                        limited to important civil and political rights. He explained that the
                        covenant would not be considered until the April meeting of the Human Rights
                        Commission.</p>
                    <p>The Declaration had been referred to the Economic and Social Council at its
                        recent session. The Council, however, had not been able to consider it
                        because of the Soviet filibuster on freedom of information, and it had been
                        referred to the General Assembly by unanimous action of all the Council
                        members except the Eastern European states. Ambassador Austin asked whether
                        there was something special about the position of Belgium on this item,
                        noting that M. Lebeau had protested against the inclusion of the item on the
                        agenda. Mr. Sandifer and Mrs. Roosevelt knew no basis for this position.
                        Ambassador Austin suggested that it was a matter which should be followed up
                        to see precisely what the situation was.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sandifer recommended that the Delegation support approval of the
                        Declaration by the Assembly. The United States efforts should be in the
                        direction of obtaining approval of the Declaration without amendments. If it
                        were open to amendments there would be a long discussion and much time would
                        be lost. Moreover, the Declaration might be emasculated and elaborated to
                        such an extent that the United States would not find it acceptable. Mr.
                        Sandifer noted, however, that Chairman Malik (Lebanon) had thought it would
                        be difficult to avoid detailed discussion and the submission of numerous
                        amendments. Mrs. Roosevelt informed the Delegation that the French had at
                        least one amendment which they wished to submit and she assumed that the
                        Soviets would also submit amendments. Mr. Sandifer stated that Chairman
                        Malik was hoping to have a meeting of the Members of the Human Rights
                        Commission, except for the Eastern European states, which meeting would
                        discuss the methods of handling this subject in the Assembly. It would be
                        desirable for this group to take a consolidated position in Committee III.
                        Upon inquiry by the Secretary, Mrs. Roosevelt indicated her agreement with
                        these tactics.</p>
                    <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0311"/>
                    <p>Mr. Dulles asked whether any consideration had been given to the effect which
                        the adoption of this Declaration would have—in particular, whether any new
                        obligations, other than those already in the Charter, were involved. Mr.
                        Gross replied that there were none, and that this was the view of both the
                        Department of State and the Attorney General. Mr. Sandifer pointed out that
                        this was a declaration of principle and was not legally binding.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dulles read the provision of the Declaration which states “everyone has
                        the right of access to public employment” and recalled that he had had to
                        sign a declaration that he was not a Communist at the time of his
                        appointment to the Delegation. Mr. Cohen said he agreed in general with the
                        discussion but believed it important to guard against the thought that
                        voting for the Declaration did not mean anything. While there was no legal
                        obligation, it certainly committed us to favor and work toward the
                        establishment of certain general principles. Mr. Dulles agreed. Mr. Sandifer
                        pointed out that, while the Declaration did not bind us as a matter of law
                        to apply the principles set forth automatically in the courts in the general
                        way that a treaty would, it was nevertheless an important declaration,
                        carrying with it the moral weight of the General Assembly. Mr. Sandifer
                        further called attention to the limiting clause in Article 27 of the
                        Declaration. He pointed out that this clause made the application of the
                        Declaration subject to interpretation by each state. He assumed,
                        accordingly, that Mr. Dulles’ question regarding the rights of all
                        individuals to public employment would be answered in that way as regards
                        Communists. Mr. Thorp observed that there were a number of things in the
                        Declaration which did not represent established United States practice but
                        did represent an atmosphere of intention, as had the American Declaration of
                        Independence.</p>
                    <p>The Delegation thereupon approved the position paper.<note n="7"

                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. Dulles inquired whether the Delegation had completed consideration of the
                        Declaration of Human Eights at its previous meeting. <pb n="292"
                            xml:id="pg_292" facs="0312"/>Mr. Sandifer said he regarded the
                        discussion as completed for present purposes. The United States position was
                        simply to seek action on the Declaration on the basis of general debate
                        without article by article discussion. Messrs. McNeil (UK) and Santa Cruz
                        (Chile) had agreed to this procedure. Mrs. Roosevelt noted that the Belgian
                        representative, while himself expressing willingness to forego further
                        detailed debate, wanted to give other states, not members of the Human
                        Rights Commission, an opportunity to express their views on the Declaration.
                        She said that Santa Cruz was suddenly most amenable and cooperative on this
                        matter and had volunteered to attempt to work out a common program with the
                        other Latin American states. There was a general feeling that the
                        Declaration should go through the Assembly as quickly as possible with only
                        brief discussion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dulles believed it was important for the Delegation to make clear just
                        what its view of the Declaration was, stating his own great sympathy with
                        the Declaration and his feeling that the provisions of the Declaration
                        dealing with human rights were very important. He pointed out that
                        unexplained United States support of the Declaration, however, might lead to
                        misunderstanding, if it were not made clear that the Declaration is a
                        general statement of principle and aspiration and not a legal document,
                        standing in relation to a future covenant of human rights, in the same way
                        that the American Declaration of Independence was related to the Bill of
                        Rights. He emphasized that it was important to make this very clear to avoid
                        any unfortunate inferences. He referred again to the statement regarding the
                        right of any person to public employment.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Roosevelt emphasized that the Declaration was the result of a
                        combination of compromises. The particular point on government employment
                        was a French proposal. She believed that the opening statement of the United
                        States Delegation should carefully point out the exact status of the
                        Declaration and that an attempt should be made to get this statement
                        published in the American press. As regarded the possibility of Communists
                        in government positions, Mrs. Roosevelt commented on the fact that the
                        Communist party had not been outlawed and emphasized that there was a
                        security clause in the Declaration. Mr. Dulles explained that his only
                        concern was to make the status of the Declaration very plain. He referred to
                        the possibility of the Republican Party picking up an isolated clause such
                        as that on public employment and interpreting it as a commitment by the
                        United States Delegation agreeing to employment of Communists in such
                        agencies as the Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rusk noted that the Canadians had appointed a parliamentary commission to
                        examine the Declaration on the basis that, if approved <pb n="293"
                            xml:id="pg_293" facs="0313"/>by the General Assembly, it would in fact
                        set up certain standards which would have to be followed by Canada. There
                        were certain things in the Declaration which frankly worried the Canadians
                        who were anxious to discuss them in detail. Mrs. Roosevelt pointed out that
                        there was no way to prevent discussion but warned that if detailed
                        discussion was begun, there was serious question as to whether the
                        Declaration would be gotten through at all. Mr. Rusk said the Canadians
                        would very much like to meet with Mrs. Roosevelt on this matter; he believed
                        they had a legitimate serious concern since they expected to apply the
                        Declaration in Canada.</p>

                            Proposal on Violation by the USSR of Fundamental Human Rights,
                            Traditional Diplomatic Practices, and Other Principles of the
                            Charter</hi>. (Mr. Sandifer)</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sandifer explained that this item had been proposed by Chile as the
                        result of the detention in the USSR of the Chilean Ambassador and his staff,
                        after his refusal to leave the country without his son’s Soviet wife, who
                        was refused an exit visa. The actual complaint was in two parts: a general
                        proposal charging the USSR with the violation of fundamental human rights in
                        preventing the Soviet wives of foreign nationals from leaving the USSR, and
                        a specific proposal regarding the violation by the USSR of fundamental human
                        rights in refusing to allow a member of the family of the ex-Ambassador of
                        Chile to the USSR to leave that country. Chile had broken diplomatic
                        relations with the USSR as a result of this case, and the Chilean Ambassador
                        to the USSR and the Soviet Ambassador to Chile had both been held in custody
                        in the respective countries until September, 1948 when an exchange had been
                        worked out.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sandifer pointed out that the Soviet government had consistently refused
                        visas to Soviet wives of foreign nationals and stated that there were about
                        1,000 United States citizens whose wives had been refused exit visas.<note

                    <p>The USSR had advised the Secretary-General of the United Nations that it
                        regarded the Chilean proposal as illegal and unfounded and as representing
                        interference in matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of
                        states. Mr. Sandifer noted that Mr. Vyshinsky,<note n="2" xml:id="d184fn2"
                            >Andrei Y. Vyshinsky, Chairman of the Soviet Delegation to the General
                            Assembly.</note> in the General Committee discussion of the Chilean
                        item, had referred to the hostile unfriendly attitude toward Soviet citizens
                        abroad, and had stated that it was better to keep such Soviet wives in the
                        Soviet Union than to permit them to go abroad where they would <pb n="294"
                            xml:id="pg_294" facs="0314"/>be subjected to unfriendly treatment. A
                        Soviet law, moreover, now forbids the marriage of Soviet citizens to
                        foreigners.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sandifer observed that there had been general debate of this whole
                        problem in both the Economic and Social Council and the Human Rights
                        Commission, and a resolution had been adopted by the Economic and Social
                        Council deploring legislation forbidding mixed marriages, or any legislation
                        limiting the freedom to choose one’s spouse or to leave one’s country. The
                        Draft Declaration of Human Rights in Article 11(2) had provision on this
                        matter: everyone has the right to leave freely any country, including his
                        own. The Soviets had tried to amend this by the addition of a clause, making
                        this provision subject to the application of national laws, which would have
                        completely nullified the provision.</p>
                    <p>The staff recommendations were as follows: (1) the United States should
                        support a resolution requesting the International Court of Justice to give
                        an advisory opinion as to whether the refusal by the USSR to permit the
                        Soviet daughter-in-law of the former Ambassador of Chile to leave that
                        country is or is not in conformity with international law. Mr. Sandifer
                        indicated that this was a proper question for an advisory opinion,
                        indicating that in general, under established principles of international
                        law, with some variations, the family of an Ambassador shares his privileges
                        and immunities. (2) As to the general problem of the detention of the Soviet
                        wives of citizens of various countries, the United States should present to
                        the Assembly its own experience, pointing out the undesirability of
                        separating families, the inhuman character of such treatment of Soviet wives
                        of foreign nationals, but indicating that it is recognized that there is no
                        legal obligation on the part of the Soviet Union to permit these persons to
                        leave.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Roosevelt observed that many of the persons involved were married to
                        British and American soldiers before the adoption of the law prohibiting
                        marriage to foreigners. She believed this was an added argument to be made
                        in the case of a number of Soviet wives. She noted that Mrs. Churchill,
                        acting for the Red Cross, had succeeded in obtaining exit visas for certain
                        wives.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Austin asked whether traditional diplomatic practices, the basis
                        of Chile’s case, actually made a rule of law. Mr. Sandifer replied that the
                        International Court would have before it the question whether, as a matter
                        of practice, a rule of international law has developed which included the
                        family of the son of the Ambassador in the privileges and immunities enjoyed
                        by the Ambassador. Mr. Gross pointed out that there were well established
                        rules of international law, as to which there was no dispute, regarding the
                        status of the retinue of a diplomatic envoy. The question of the status of
                        members of their <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0315"/>families was still
                        an open one. He commented that it was unfortunate that this item had been
                        referred to Committee 6 since it meant that it would be discussed by lawyers
                        who might miss the broad questions of human rights which were involved.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Thorp commented that the USSR has had a difficult time putting forward
                        any logical arguments on this matter. For example, it would argue that any
                        action in connection with Soviet wives would infringe upon domestic
                        jurisdiction, but at the same time would urge action calling for woman
                        suffrage in all states, certainly a purely domestic matter. He thought this
                        agenda item afforded the United States a beautiful propaganda opportunity.
                        Mrs. Roosevelt said her private conversations with the Soviets had reflected
                        this same Soviet logical difficulty. A Ukrainian delegate, for example, had
                        told her that there were not enough women affected for this to be a problem
                        deserving United Nations consideration, and later had fallen back on the
                        argument that none of the women in question were Ukrainian. Agreeing that
                        this was a good propaganda case, she went on to recount that Bogomolov<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d184fn3">Alexandre Bogomolov, Soviet Ambassador to France
                            and at this time also one of the Representatives on the Soviet
                            Delegation to the General Assembly.</note> had indicated to her the
                        Soviet position grew out of the situation of certain Soviet women who had
                        married French prisoners and had then returned to France with their
                        husbands. Those women now wished to return to the USSR but under French law
                        were not permitted to take their children with them and so were forced to
                        stay in France.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary noted that the recommendations in the position paper<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d184fn4">Not printed.</note> stated that the United States
                        should “take the initiative”. He wondered whether this meant the United
                        States should push the case propaganda-wise. Mr. Sandifer indicated that it
                        simply meant we would press this case ourselves in the Committee.</p>
                    <p>The position paper was approved without further discussion.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Gross explained that this was the first item to be considered by
                        Committee 6. Reviewing the history of the action taken by the United <pb
                            n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0316"/>Nations on genocide, Mr. Gross
                        referred to the fact that the Assembly in 1946 had declared genocide to be a
                        crime under international law, and had gone on record in favor of a
                        declaration on this subject. Subsequently, an <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi>
                        committee of <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> had drafted the
                        actual convention<note n="1" xml:id="d185fn1">For text of the <hi
                                rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> committee draft (United Nations document
                            E/794), see United Nations, <hi rend="italic">Official Records of the
                                Economic and Social Council, Third Year, Seventh Session, Supplement
                                No. 6</hi>.</note> which was before the Assembly for decision. He
                        noted that, while the United States favored international enforcement of the
                        convention, the U.S.S.R. had consistently taken the line that enforcement
                        should be by national courts alone. In addition, the United Kingdom opposed
                        the United States position, and favored the reference of the convention for
                        detailed study to the International Law Commission, which could, in
                        particular, perform more work on the definition of genocide. This would, of
                        course, delay adoption of a convention which suited the British, since they
                        were actually opposed to any convention. So far as the U.S.S.R. was
                        concerned, while it had attempted to make propaganda out of the convention,
                        in the last analysis, because of its position on national enforcement, Mr.
                        Gross thought it would not adhere to a convention acceptable to the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>He recommended that the United States support the convention, which he noted
                        was favored by many civic and religious organizations in the United States.
                        Mr. Gross presented the following recommendations to the Delegation: (1) the
                        United States should support in general the text of the convention; (2) the
                        Delegation should endeavor to add to Articled “economic” and “social”
                        groups, although the position here would be flexible in terms of the
                        position taken by other states; and (3) if a number of states strongly
                        opposed the inclusion of “political” groups in the convention, the
                        Delegation should reconsider this matter. Mr. Gross explained that it had
                        been felt that it was not appropriate to press for the inclusion of
                        “economic” and “social” groups at the price of losing support for the
                        convention. He noted also that some of the Latin American states and the
                        Soviet bloc did not like the reference to “political” groups, which the
                        United State thought very important. He did not wish any final decision to
                        be taken on this matter until the positions of other states had been
                        disclosed by debate in Committee 6. There were also likely to be proposals
                        to include “religious” or “cultural” groups in the convention. He would
                        regard this as a dangerous extension, particularly because it would not seem
                        desirable to apply the convention to individuals. It should be strictly
                        limited to “actions against individuals.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dulles thought it was important to try to add provisions for “economic”
                        and “social” groups to the convention. After all, the idea <pb n="297"
                            xml:id="pg_297" facs="0317"/>behind the convention was that people
                        should not be killed except for malfeasance. He thought persecution for
                        economic and social views was a great danger, and if it were not dealt with
                        in the convention, the United Nations was almost, by silence, implicitly
                        approving attacks on such groups. Mrs. Roosevelt agreed that, while it was
                        probably desirable to include economic and social groups, their inclusion
                        was at the same time an argument for the inclusion of cultural genocide, to
                        which the United States was opposed. Mr. Dulles, however, did not think it
                        was necessarily desirable to perpetuate foreign language groups, for
                        example, within another country, referring to his experience in the Italian
                        Peace Treaty negotiations. Mrs. Roosevelt said she had meant that those who
                        wished to continue the use of their own language and follow their own
                        customs should be permitted to do so. She noted that some States forbade
                        this sort of thing; in such a situation that the concept of cultural
                        genocide would be helpful.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Thorp observed that the real question was whether the convention should
                        be limited to the right of the minority to survive, or whether it should
                        also describe their rights and privileges. He thought these latter
                        principles could be developed elsewhere. Mr. Jessup thought it might be
                        undesirable to oppose Article 3 in terms of the general American position on
                        the protection of minority rights. It should be made clear that our
                        opposition to this article did not indicate any lack of support for the
                        rights of minorities. Mr. Gross thought that, in discussion, it would be
                        important to emphasize the relationship of the convention on genocide to the
                        Declaration on Human Rights. In his opinion, it was better to preserve the
                        integrity of this convention to the issue of life and death. The Secretary
                        pointed out that if the term “cultural” were used, it would lead to endless
                        debates on its definition.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then asked for the Delegation’s views on the recommendations,
                        and the recommendations were accepted; except that, on the recommendation of
                        Mr. Gross, the Delegation decided that it would be appropriate not to
                        include social groups. It would, however, favor the inclusion of economic
                        groups.</p>

                                    xml:id="pg_299" facs="0319"/>by a vote of twenty-nine to twelve
                                with nine abstentions. Subsequently, when it appeared that some
                                states might refrain from ratifying the Convention because of the
                                retention of these groups therein, the United States delegate stated
                                that he would support the proposal for deletion of political groups
                                in the hope that there would be a maximum number of ratifications,
                                and in the further hope that at a future date the Convention might
                                be amended to include them. By a two-thirds majority vote of
                                twenty-six to four with nine abstentions, the Committee decided to
                                reconsider this question. Following this, the Committee by a second
                                vote of twenty-two to six with twelve abstentions, decided to
                                exclude political groups from the Convention.</item>

                                    provision reading as follows: “Having taken note of the legal
                                    precedent established by the judgment of the International
                                    Military Tribunal at Nurnberg, of 30 September–1 October, 1946”.

                                    the Soviet Delegation has now proposed for adoption in the
                                    Plenary Session. In this connection, it should also be borne in
                                    mind that the Sixth Committee has submitted for approval by the
                                    Assembly a draft resolution presented by the representative of
                                    Iran (Resolution C), recommending that members of the United
                                    Nations administering dependent territories take such measures
                                    as are necessary and feasible to enable the provisions of the
                                    Convention to be extended to those territories as soon as
                                    possible.</item>

                                <item>It is unlikely that the Iranian delegation would reintroduce
                                    its proposal (Document A/C.6/218) to add to Article VII a new
                                    paragraph reading as follows: “They may also be tried by
                                    tribunals other than those of the states in the territories of
                                    which the act was committed, if they have been arrested by the
                                    authories of such states, and provided no request has been made
                                    for their extradition.” The Committee rejected the principle of
                                    universal repression involved in the provision just quoted by a

                        finally approved by the Committee on December 6 by a vote of 29 to 0 with 7

                    <p>There is a possibility that some amendments to the Declaration may be moved
                        in the Plenary session. There has been no specific indication that the
                        Soviet Delegation would introduce amendments. It did not contest vigorously
                        the decisions taken in the final reading of the text of the Declaration in
                        Committee. However, in view of the number of Soviet amendments rejected by
                        the Committee, it is possible that an effort may be made to obtain favorable
                        action in the Plenary session on some of them. So far as can be anticipated,
                        all such amendments should be opposed by the United States Delegation.</p>
                    <p>The British Delegation has indicated that it would move for the deletion of

                        the Declaration to the inhabitants of trust and non-self-governing
                        territories. The United States Delegation should vote for the deletion of
                        this Article, if such move is made, but should not speak on the
                            subject.<note n="3" xml:id="d187fn3">For developments in the plenary,

                            Mrs. Roosevelt, hailing the declaration as “a great event both in the
                            life of the United Nations and in the life of mankind”, stressed the
                            United States view as to the intrinsic importance of the document:
                                <p>“In giving our approval to the declaration today, it is of
                                primary importance that we keep clearly in mind the basic character
                                of the document. It is not a treaty; it is not an international
                                agreement. It is not and does not purport to be a statement of law
                                or of legal obligation. It is a declaration of basic principles of
                                human rights and freedoms, to be stamped with the approval of the
                                General Assembly by formal vote of its members, and to serve as a
                                common standard of achievement for all peoples of all nations.” (<hi

                        freedom of information and of the press, the United Nations Conference on
                        Freedom of Information convened at Geneva, Switzerland on March 23, 1948.
                        This was the culmination of a series of events relating to freedom of
                        information that occurred in several United Nations bodies from the
                        beginning of the Organization in 1946: (1) the January 4, 1946 proposal of
                        the Philippine Commonwealth at the initiatory meetings of the General
                        Assembly in London that there be convened an international conference of the
                        press; and the action of the General Assembly in placing the item on the
                        agenda, for its session in New York later in 1946. (2) <gloss
                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> approval on June 21, 1946 of a
                        modified United States proposal for the establishment by the Commission on
                        Human Rights of a Sub-Commission on Freedom of Information and of the Press.
                        (3) Adoption by the General Assembly on December 14, 1946 of a revised
                        Philippine proposal for the holding of an international conference on
                        freedom of information during the year 1947. (4) Establishment on May 19,
                        1947 of the Sub-Commission on Freedom of Information and of the Press and
                        its drafting of an agenda for the proposed conference. (5) The <gloss
                            target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> resolutions of August 15, 1947 in
                        which were formulated the projected organization and provisional agenda of
                        the conference: (6) The very extensive discussion of the draft agenda by the
                        Third Committee of the General Assembly, at the General Assembly’s second
                        session in New York, on October 3, 4, 6, and 7, 1947 in connection ‘with a
                        draft resolution of the Soviet’: Union; and later on October 24, 25, 28, and
                        29, 1947 in connection with a draft resolution of Yugoslavia on the
                        dissemination of slanderous reports. (7) The approval by the General
                        Assembly on November 17, 1947 of Resolution 132 (III), taking note of the
                        provisional agenda prepared by <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> for
                        the impending freedom of information conference; and calling <gloss

                    <p>The United States approached the freedom of information conference with
                        “considerable pessimism”, attested to in public documentation by the
                        Official Report itself of the United States Delegation (Department of State
                        Publication 3150, <hi rend="italic">Report of the United States Delegates
                            with Related Documents</hi>, United Nations Conference on Freedom
                        Information, Geneva, Switzerland, March 23–April 21, 1948, United States
                        Government Printing Office, 1948). A principal reason for this pessimism was
                        the “Communist-propaganda attack, which made considerable headway, carried
                        on both within and without the United Nations against the American press and
                        other organs of opinion.” (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, page 2) These
                        developments had occurred at the second regular session of the General
                        Assembly in the autumn of 1947, as evidenced by Communist-bloc charges of
                        “warmongering” by the United States, the Yugoslav draft resolution on
                        slanderous reporting, and the debate in the Third Committee on the draft
                        agenda of the impending conference and the issue of freedom of information
                        itself. The deep concern of the United States Government at these events,
                        and the planning that went into the formulation of pre-conference potions to
                        counter-act these developments at the conference itself, is amply reflected
                        in the official files of the United States Delegation to the conference (see
                        last paragraph).</p>
                    <p>The United States Delegation the Freedom of Information Conference consisted
                        of ten members, with an advisory staff of fifteen officers most of whom were
                        from the Department of State. The Delegation was led by William Benton,
                        Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs until shortly before the
                        conference met. The public members of the Delegation were all persons of
                        prominence in the media. For the official list see Department of State <hi
                            rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, March 21, 1948, page 378.</p>
                    <p>The overall conference strategy of the United States Delegation as described
                        by the Delegation Chairman was to orient the conference to “freedom of
                        information” rather than “obligations of the press” which meant legal
                        controls. Thus at the outset of the conference the United States Delegation
                        introduced a draft resolution on the general principles of freedom of
                        information; and also a proposal for an international convention to
                        guarantee newspaper correspondents greater access to news and greater
                        freedom in its transmission (a “news-gathering” convention). Also as
                        described by the Delegation Chairman, the United States program also
                        projected taking the initiative in proposing nonrestrictive remedies (as
                        opposed to legal controls) for abuses of the press, based primarily on the
                        moral responsibility of information agencies. Thus, the United States
                        proposed the right of official correction, that is, a plan for international
                        procedures whereby <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0329"/>a government
                        might submit its refutation of damaging press reports to the
                        Secretary-General of the United Nations. The Delegation also introduced a
                        draft resolution condemning “warmongering” rand the dissemination of
                        slanderous information. On the other; hand, the United States was unwilling
                        to support the establishment of elaborate United Nations machinery with wide
                        authority for investigatory or even coercive powers. The United States
                        program was to counter such a move with a proposal to establish on a
                        permanent basis the <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> Sub-Commission
                        on Freedom of Information and of the Press. All of the United States
                        proposals were adopted in one form or another, some substantially intact (as
                        the resolution on general principles), others in varying degrees of
                        modification (as the resolution on propaganda inciting to war and false
                        reporting, and the newsgathering convention).</p>
                    <p>The results of the United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information, which
                        extended from March 23 to April 21, 1948, were incorporated into a Final Act
                        which consisted of a general statement on conference organization and
                        procedures (including the implementing of decisions in the post-conference
                        period) and three annexes. Annex A consisted of the three draft conventions
                        adopted by the Conference: (1) the Draft Convention on the Gathering and
                        International Transmission of News (“the United States Convention”); (2) the
                        Draft Convention Concerning the Institution of an International Eight of
                        Correction (“the French Convention”) (on the basis of an initial United
                        States proposal); and (3) the Draft Convention on Freedom of Information

                                Mr. Osborn took the position that it was premature to appoint a
                                subcommittee to deal with resolutions on Item II, a position in
                                accord with Departmental thinking.</item>

                            <item>The day following the meeting, we received a draft of the proposed
                                joint U.K.-Australian Resolution on Item II<note n="9"
                                    xml:id="d191fn9">Not printed.</note> for our suggestions. I was
                                given to understand that this was on the initiative of the U.K.
                                Delegation. The joint Resolution contained a few points to which we
                                had major objections. Mr. Osborn sent Mr. Burton and me to the
                                British to give them our views in an informal way. We emphasized
                                that such views as we expressed were in no sense official and that
                                we were not prepared, as yet, to commit ourselves to support any of
                                the resolutions so far submitted. The British appeared to be in
                                sympathy with our views and said they would discuss them with the
                                Australians. A revision subsequent to such discussion has been
                                forwarded to <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> (<gloss

                            <item>The tactics tentatively decided upon by <gloss target="#t_USUN1"
                                    >USUN</gloss> for the next few weeks are as follows:</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>When the joint U.K.-Australian Resolution is introduced to the
                                Committee, <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> proposes to offer,
                                as amendments, those important changes which have not been accepted.
                                It is even possible that we shall introduce a resolution of our own,
                                although the former method would be preferable since our resolution
                                would be similar in many respects to that of the other two
                                delegations. A vote on Item II will almost certainly be taken before
                                the end of the month. This means that the Commission will be faced
                                with the alternatives of either going on to Item III or not meeting
                                at all for an indefinite period. Mr. Osborn’s present instructions
                                call for proceeding with Item III.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>While Mr. Osborn agrees with those who feel that there may be-a
                                good deal of logic in stopping after the vote on a Resolution on
                                Item II, he feels that the general principles are so general, that
                                even a 9 to 2 vote on them would not make the strong record we
                                should like. He, therefore, believes it desirable to proceed far
                                enough into Item III to develop a majority supported statement
                                regarding elements of safeguards. By developing such an agreed
                                statement, Mr. Osborn feels that the majority and ourselves would be
                                in the strong position of having made constructive proposals both in
                                the atomic energy field and in that of conventional armaments which
                                the Soviets and their satellites alone had refused to accept.
                                Furthermore, he thinks that the Soviet <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315"
                                    facs="0335"/>rejection of proposals on safeguards would mean
                                much more to the “man-in-the-street” than a difference merely on
                                principles—important as these principles may be.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>I asked Mr. Osborn whether he thought the discussion of safeguards
                                could be controlled in such a way as not to involve us too deeply in
                                the details of Item III, or so as not to invite a discussion on Item
                                IV, either one of which would at this time seriously embarrass us.
                                Mr. Osborn seemed confident that such discussion, could be avoided
                                in the light of his experience in the <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1"
                                    >UNAEC</gloss> where a similar danger had existed. He said,
                                however, his final attitude on the matter would be strongly
                                influenced by the reaction of friendly delegations, notably the
                                Canadian, French, and United Kingdom Delegations. With their
                                cooperation he had no doubt that the discussion could be limited to
                                the desired scope.</item>

                                whether I thought the Department would feel it worthwhile for him to
                                see them, provided the conversation were kept on a highly personal
                                basis with a clear understanding that no decision has as yet been
                                reached by the State Department I told him I was sure the Department
                                would approve such action on the basis contemplated. Both men, when
                                consulted, seemed, favorable to Mr. Osborn’s suggestion.</item>

                        <p>Mr. Leith and Mr. Osborn called on General McNaughton Tuesday afternoon,
                            January 27, 1948. George Ignatieff, General McNaughton’s top
                            assistant,-was present.</p>
                        <p>General McNaughton went over with them the situation in the Commission
                            for Conventional Armaments, with which he was relatively unacquainted.
                            He considered the plan of work and the draft of the British-Australian
                            resolution covering Item II—General Principles, immediately pointing out
                            the weakness of the Australian proposal for progress on disarmament by
                            stages.</p>
                        <p>General McNaughton then discussed the advisability of continuing through
                            Item III—Safeguards, attempting to get a majority report setting up the
                            general principles of safeguards, without, however, developing any
                            specific proposals. He rather indicated that he thought this could be
                            done in a four or five page document and that it would be worth doing
                            because if it got majority approval and the Soviets opposed it, as they
                            certainly would, it would again put the Soviets in the position of
                            refusing to come into a plan and a system of inspection which the
                            majority felt was essential to world security. General McNaughton did
                            not think there was any danger of our being drawn into a discussion of
                            actual reduction (Item IV). He suggested that we not make up our minds
                            at once on whether to proceed with Item III, but see how we made out on
                            Item II. In any event, he felt there could be no possibility of
                            considering Item IV; in other words, that the present work of the
                            Commission must be concluded either with Item II or with Item III.</p>
                        <p>Ignatieff was more diffuse in his statements and did not appear to
                            support the idea of a majority expression on principles covering
                            safeguards. (Mr. Osborn noted that on the Atomic Energy Commission
                            General McNaughton’s own views always prevailed, and always overruled
                            Ignatieff’s position, but this might not be the case in the Conventional
                            Armaments Commission:; with which General McNaughton was not as much
                            concerned.)</p>

                                Leith of the Division of International Security Affairs</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Osborn called me Friday afternoon January 30, 1948, to report on his
                            conversation with Baron de la Tournelle of the French Delegation
                            regarding the subject of future activities in the <gloss
                                target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss>. The Baron indicated that he was much
                            disappointed with the lack of progress so far made in the <gloss
                                target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss>. He had expected that since the United
                            States had taken a position of leadership in the beginning, especially
                            respecting the Plan of Work and Item I, we would have had much more
                            concrete proposals to make respecting Items II and III and would have
                            been more eager to make them. He himself thought that it would be most
                            desirable at this point to develop a basic statement on safeguards which
                            could in turn become the basis for a vote on Item III. He felt very
                            definitely that the Russians would be in no position to agree to such a
                            statement in as much as it had already been made evident that a thorough
                            going system of inspection would be contrary to what they believed their
                            interests to be. He felt definitely that any discussions on Item III
                            could be controlled to such an extent that it would not be necessary to
                            deal with material that might be embarrassing to us at this time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Osborn stated that in talking with Baron de la Tournelle the above
                            suggestions had been made on the initiative of the Baron.</p>

                        this time the question as to what will be done after December 1. To take the
                        initiative now in stopping and accepting an arms race puts us under an
                        unnecessary political handicap.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lovett stated that all countries involved were absolutely in accord on
                        the procedure. He was concerned that there is any doubt that we have reached
                        the end of the road. The time had come to be frank and he felt the time had
                        come to stop.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rusk read Mr. Lovett’s memorandum of March 12,<note n="10"
                            xml:id="d193fn10">In the memorandum under reference, in which he had

                                >RAC</gloss> D–30/1a, Lovett stated the following: <p>… I want to
                                make clear that I know of nothing in the evolution of the atomic
                                energy debate in the United Nations or in the development of the
                                world political situation which would indicate that there is any
                                useful purpose in continuing discussions on their present terms of
                                reference at the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> level. I
                                believe, therefore, that the Third Report should make this as clear
                                as possible, while leaving a loophole for renewal of discussion in
                                the unlikely event that there should be significant new proposals or
                                concessions on the part of the governments of the majority, or of
                                the Soviet Union and Poland, This saving clause should not be dwelt
                                on or emphasized in such a manner as to dilute the definitive
                                character of the report.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, while I agree that we do not at this time want to bind
                                ourselves absolutely to discuss the matter in the General Assembly,
                                it should certainly be our decision in principle to do so. …

                        </note> which stated that the Third Report should leave “a loophole for
                        renewal of discussions in the unlikely event that there should be
                        significant <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0340"/>new proposals or
                        concessions on the, part of governments of the majority, or of the Soviet
                        Union”. He stated that <gloss target="#t_UNA1">UNA</gloss> wanted to be sure
                        to leave this loophole. Mr. Lovett replied that he wanted to reserve only
                        the United States right to re-open.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rusk indicated that we had looked at no other alternatives and that we
                        might wish to have <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> support other
                        arrangements.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lovett replied that if we say we are through, that does not prevent us
                        from re-opening the question but the others should not be given the
                        opportunity to do so.</p>
                    <p>In response to a request from Mr. Lovett Mr. Osborn indicated that we must
                        call off negotiations on the broadest possible basis until the Soviets give
                        some indication of the change in their position, but that this must be done
                        in such a way as to indicate that we are not taking the problem out of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rusk indicated the desire to leave the greatest flexibility. The U.S.
                        might wish to have <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> back some sort of
                        alliance. Mr. Gullion indicated that this would not be done in AEG. Mr. Rusk
                        replied that AEG was established to consider atomic energy on the broadest
                        possible basis. Mr. Lovett felt that this would not apply to an
                        alliance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rusk referred to material proposed for inclusion in the Third Report
                        (Appendix “A”), and expressed the hope that everyone should agree upon what
                        it means. In his view, if later studies indicate that we wish to take some
                        additional steps in this field in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                        this should not be foreclosed, Mr. Lovett replied that the loophole is for
                        the U.S., not for others.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rusk referred to the minutes of the Secretaries of State, War and Navy,
                        September 11, 1947,<note n="11" xml:id="d193fn11">For the pertinent portion

                        secretaries agreed that, “It was also the sense of the discussion that the
                        U.S. take no initiative at this juncture in the <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1"
                            >UNAEC</gloss>, in the Security Council, or in the General Assembly, to
                        terminate negotiations looking toward international control of atomic
                        energy. We should, however, review our whole position in view of the
                        situation arising out of failure to reach agreement in <gloss
                            target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> thus far, particularly with respect to
                        our defense plans and our atomic energy relationship with Great Britain and
                        Canada.” He also referred to Secretary Marshall’s statement at this meeting:
                        “That it appeared certain that we should not break off negotiations in the
                            <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> until we have considered and
                        decided our position following the break off.” Mr. Rusk expressed the view
                        that we should not break off one thing until we know where we are He was
                        worried about a flat break-off. Mr. Lovett replied that the situation
                        referred to by General Marshall had been taken care of by <pb n="321"

                                >passim</hi>.</note> Mr. Lovett felt that the position paper should
                        indicate a clear decision.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rusk stated that there was no question of dissolving the <gloss
                            target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> or withdrawing the United States offer. Mr.
                        Lovett indicated that no mention should be made of withdrawal. However, it
                        was his view that Congress would not authorize the making of the offer
                        today.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rusk indicated that the U.S. Government’s work on the Baruch: proposal on
                        international control should not be suspended. Mr. Lovett indicated that he
                        did not object.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gullion pointed out that it was dangerous to discuss stages. Mr.
                        Hickerson agreed and Mr. Lovett indicated that we could not do that.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lovett indicated that others should take the initiative rather than the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lovett asked what the advantage was of paragraph 2 of the Appendix. Mr.
                        Osborn indicated that the General Assembly should debate the question of
                        atomic energy with a specific purpose in mind and that this recommendation
                        provided such a purpose. Mr. Lovett was: fearful of the open-end offer of
                        this paragraph and asked why it might not be omitted. Mr. Osborn replied
                        that others feel that it would lay us open to a charge of calling off, and
                        that by this formula we can more effectively sell our position that
                        negotiations be moved to a higher level.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hickerson expressed concern that winding up at this time in connection
                        with other contemplated actions, might have an unusual effect, and might
                        enable Communists to say this was an atomic alliance-Mr. Gullion replied
                        that this would be a good effect. Mr. Hickerson indicated that the paragraph
                        would help.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rusk indicated that the paragraph would be very important in convincing
                        people that we want to continue negotiations whenever there is a basis. Mr.
                        Gullion feared that it might be interpreted as indicating that we wished to
                        continue negotiations. Mr. Rusk replied that we never want to close and lock
                        the door.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Blaisdell interpreted paragraph 2 of the Appendix as requiring agreement
                        of all sponsors. Mr. Rusk indicated that it was not necessary to decide this
                        at this time. Mr. Arneson and Mr. Hickerson expressed the view that the
                        paragraph in question contemplated agreement by all sponsoring governments.
                        Mr. Rusk stated that we should not create another veto. Mr. Lovett agreed
                        with Messrs. Arneson and Hickerson and asked that the policy paper be
                        brought in line with this.<note n="13" xml:id="d193fn13">The policy paper

                        <p>In the course of nearly two years of negotiation and study the
                            Governments of the majority have agreed on the principles essential to
                            any fully effective system of international control of atomic energy.
                            The Commission has been unable to secure Soviet agreement to even the
                            essential elements of such a system. The Commission has not found any
                            willingness on the part of the Soviet Union to accept the nature and
                            extent of participation in the world community required of all nations
                            in this field by the First and Second Reports of the Atomic Energy

                            has created a situation that is beyond the competence of this

                            that no useful purpose can be served by carrying on negotiations at the
                            Commission level.</p>
                        <p>The Commission therefore recommends that until such time as the sponsors

                            France, U.S.S.R., United Kingdom and United States) find, through prior
                            consultation, that there exists a basis for negotiations on the
                            international control of atomic energy and so report to the General
                            Assembly, negotiations in the Atomic Energy Commission should be
                            deferred.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with its terms of reference, the Atomic Energy Commission
                            reports this evaluation of the situation and its recommendations.,
                            thereon to the Security Council for its consideration and transmittal,

                    </p>
                    <p>2. Soviet opposition to the essential elements of an effective system of
                        international control as supported by the majority of the Commission in its
                        First and Second Reports derives not merely from specific disagreement with
                        the essential elements themselves but is an expression of the overall Soviet
                        policy of obstruction of the aims and principles of the non-Soviet
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>3. It is, therefore, unrealistic to expect to obtain Soviet acceptance of the
                        essential bases for an effective system of international control except as a
                        major reversal of fundamental Soviet policy may occur. Thus, the impasse
                        resulting from Soviet refusal to accept the majority-supported proposals for
                        control of atomic energy is such as to be beyond the competence of the U.N.
                        Atomic Energy Commission to resolve.</p>
                    <p>4. This fact should be brought to the attention of the world through a Third
                        Report of the <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> which will expose the
                        unwillingness of the Soviet Union to accept the obligations of membership in
                        a world <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0344"/>community required for
                        effective international control and the complete inadequacy of the Soviet
                        counter proposals.</p>
                    <p>5. The existence of the impasse precludes any useful purpose being served by
                        continuing negotiations in the <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss>. The
                        record of the USSR in the <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> and the
                        course of USSR relations with the rest of the world in the past two years
                        does not warrant the degree of mutual confidence necessary to permit
                        effective negotiation in the <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> on
                        those strategic and political details of the majority plan which would still
                        require elaboration before a draft treaty could be submitted. To continue
                        discussions in the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> under these
                        circumstances would be prejudicial to U.S. security and would give the
                        peoples of the world a false idea of the prospects for international
                        control.</p>
                    <p>6. In order to focus world opinion on the situation created by Soviet
                        intransigeance, the Third Report of the <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1"

                            conversations initiated by the United States, stated: “In order to
                            attain the most effective means of entirely eliminating the use of
                            atomic energy for destructive purposes and promoting its widest use for
                            industrial and humanitarian purposes, we are of the opinion that at the
                            earliest practicable date a Commission should be set up under the United
                            Nations Organization to prepare recommendations for submission to the
                            Organization.” The Declaration recommended that the Commission make
                            specific proposals with regard to the following phases of the

                                            This Government and the majority of the Atomic Energy
                                            Commission have insisted that there can be no assurance

                                            ownership of all source material after it is mined. The
                                            Soviet Union, on the other hand, considers that periodic
                                            inspection of mining facilities is sufficient. In the
                                            Soviet view source material should be left in national

                                            The Soviet Union, on the other hand, considers that
                                            dangerous facilities should be left in national hands

                                            in principle that the international agency would itself
                                            conduct research and development activities, the Soviet
                                            Union would permit national research and development of

                                            States. In addition, the Soviet Union would make no

                                            development activities of a non-dangerous

                                            would clearly signify to the world that the safeguards

                                            once and that international control including safeguards
                                            should be worked out and established later.</item>

                                            punishment of treaty violations must be swift and
                                            certain, and that there must be no procedure, including

                                            forward either as amendments and additions to the First
                                            Report or as separate proposals submitted on 11 June.
                                            The discussion on the Soviet Union amendments, which is
                                            summarized in part III of this Report, has not led the

                                            summarized in part IV, has led to the conclusion that
                                            ‘these proposals as they now stand and the explanations
                                            given thereon do not provide an adequate basis for the
                                            development by the Committee of specific proposals for
                                            an effective system of international control of atomic
                                            energy’. It is evident, therefore, that these
                                            discussions have not led to a reconciliation of the
                                            views of the Soviet Union with those of the majority of

                                            proposals on other topics in the Summary of Principal
                                            Subjects can be worked out in detail. Clearly, much
                                            remains to be done before the final terms of a treaty or
                                            convention can be drafted. The Commission intends to
                                            proceed with the remaining topics in the summary and, at
                                            the same time, will continue its endeavors to clarify
                                            and resolve, where possible, the existing points of
                                            disagreement.”</p>

                        <p>13. Had there been an early meeting of minds on any point between the
                            Soviets and the majority, or had the course of Western-Soviet relations
                            in the last two years developed any cause for mutual confidence, it
                            would have been possible before now for the United States to have
                            entertained some definite proposals for negotiating a phasing plan, or
                            even a plan for strategic location of dangerous activities. The task has
                            now been rendered practically impossible as the disagreement has
                            crystallized and as Soviet-U.S. relations have deteriorated across the
                            board.</p>
                        <p>14. In the course of nearly two years of negotiation and study the
                            Governments of a majority of the Commission have agreed on the
                            principles essential to any fully effective system of international
                            control of atomic energy. The Commission has been unable to secure the
                            agreements of the Soviet Union to even the essential elements of such a
                            system. The Commission has not found any willingness on the part of the
                            Soviet Union to accept the nature and extent of participation in the
                            world community required of all nations in this field by the First and
                            Second Reports of the Atomic Energy Commission. In this situation no
                            useful purpose can be served by carrying on negotiations at the
                            Commission level. The failure to achieve agreement on the international
                            control of atomic energy arises from a situation that is beyond the
                            competence of the Commission.</p>

                                    entirely appropriate for the General Assembly to consider the
                                    matter again. Furthermore, the recommendation in paragraph 16,
                                    being in effect a modification of the Commission’s terms of
                                    reference contained in the General Assembly Resolution of

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Lovett</hi>—I learn from New York that the Canadian
                        Ambassador will probably tell you that his Government does not believe that
                        the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission’s Third Report should include in
                        it a specific recommendation that the Report be considered by the General
                        Assembly. Their view is that it is not necessary so long ahead of time to
                        announce our intention to go before the Assembly. All the other nations on
                        the Commission agree with Osborn that consideration by the Assembly is
                        imperative, and that the report should indicate this intention.</p>
                    <p>I imagine that there is somewhere in the Canadian Department of External
                        Affairs the same reluctance to face up to the impasse as you have
                        encountered here and there in this Department. The provision for reference
                        to the Assembly has come to be the test of a firm intention to bring an end
                        to the filibuster. Those who do not wish to suspend talk are reluctant to go
                        on record in favor of Assembly consideration. There is a Micawberish hope
                        that something will turn up.</p>
                    <p>The arguments for Assembly consideration are well known to you and I need not
                        review them here. The need for spelling out the intention to go before the
                        Assembly can be summarized briefly:</p>

                    <p>On February 16, 1946, the Security Council directed the Military Staff
                        Committee to examine Article 43 from the military point of view and report
                        on it “in due course.” The dilatory and obstructive tactics of the Soviet
                        delegation made progress very slow until the early part of 1947.</p>
                    <p>On December 14, 1946, the General Assembly recommended that the Council
                        “accelerate as much as possible” the conclusion of agreements under Article
                        43. On February 13, 1947, the Council requested the Military Staff Committee
                        to submit not later than April 30, 1947, “its recommendations with regard to
                        the basic principles which should govern the organization of the United
                        Nations Armed Force.” The outcome was a report<note n="3" xml:id="d196fn3"

                        those of the USSR on 1) the principle which should govern the strength and
                        composition of the forces made available to the Council on call by each
                        permanent member, 2) the areas within which forces made available should
                        remain when not employed by the Council, 3) the arrangements governing the
                        return <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0358"/>of the forces to these areas
                        after carrying out any task assigned to them by the Council, and 4) the
                        question of whether or not bases are embraced in the “assistance and
                        facilities” mentioned in Article 43.</p>
                    <p>The Security Council considered this report at eleven meetings held from June
                        4 to July 15, 1947. No apparent progress was made toward the resolution of
                        the divergences of view; the Soviet representative plainly indicated that
                        the USSR does not intend to modify its views and that it considers
                        acceptance of its version of each of the disputed principles to be a
                        prerequisite to the negotiation of agreements under Article 43.</p>
                    <p>On December 15, 1947, a subcommittee submitted to the Military Staff
                        Committee a report on the overall strength and the composition of forces
                        which should be made available to the Security Council on its call. On land
                        forces the tentative estimates of the five delegations given in this report
                        are substantially in agreement. On naval forces, there is a considerable
                        area of agreement with three important exceptions: the USSR will not agree
                        to the inclusion of battleships or aircraft carriers; the US estimate of
                        submarines is considerably higher than the agreed estimates of the other
                        four; and with respect to the number of divisions for which assault shipping
                        should be made available, the US, France and China are close to agreement,
                        whereas the Soviet Union considers that none should be made available, and
                        the UK considers it premature to discuss the question. On aircraft the
                        permanent members other than the US are close to agreement; and the US,
                        whose original figures were over three times those of the others, has
                        indicated its willingness to reduce its figures to approximately twice those
                        of the others in order to reach agreement. The Military Staff Committee is
                        now considering the subcommittee report.</p>

                        We are unable to see what practical purpose this could serve; and it is our
                        view that it is unprofitable for this Government in the long run to strike
                        attitudes, for the sake of appearing virtuous, when there is no intrinsic
                        consideration of national interest involved. The real problems of world
                        security at this juncture are plainly the ones created by the policies of
                        the Soviet Union itself. The Security Council is generally powerless to act
                        in these matters; and even if it were able to take decisions, no forces
                        which might be placed at its disposal in present conditions could
                        conceivably be great enough to enable it to enforce its decisions against
                        the will of the Soviet Union.</p>

                    <p>As for disarmament, we consider it useless and misleading to speak of the
                        regulation and reduction of armaments before peace treaties have been
                        concluded to liquidate the recent war and before there has been a general
                        and adequate relaxation of tension between the Soviet Union and the western
                        world.</p>
                    <p>If a favorable opportunity should present itself, I would still urge that an
                        effort be made to induce the Senator to omit or modify this passage. The
                        phrase about disarmament, for example, could be modified by the words: “as
                        soon as the world situation permits.”</p>
                    <p>There are other points in the language of the resolution which I would have
                        wished could have been omitted; but I assume that Senator Vandenberg is
                        already so deeply committed to most of these formulae that there is no use
                        in trying to get him to depart from them.</p>

                            Union and the Ukraine). It formed the substance of the Third Report of

                        because the latter might have blurred the issue. He said that he anticipated
                        that Mr. Gromyko would attempt to draw some advantage from the fact that
                        this Government had not yet stated whether it was for ultimate “destruction”
                        or “disposal of” atomic weapons tinder the majority plan.</p>

                    <p>I said that we were working on a position statement, based on the Joint
                        Chiefs of Staff’s position of July 23, 1947, “that they saw no objection,
                        after successful establishment by treaty or convention, of control agreement
                        embodying the plans of the U.S. (Baruch plan) proposal for the control of
                        atomic energy, and after adequate demonstration of the plan’s effectiveness,
                        to the disposal of existing atomic weapons by any means, <hi rend="italic"

                    <p>Mr. Osborn said that he thought the statement ought to make clear that the
                        word “destruction” was relatively meaningless if it were meant only to apply
                        to weapons and not to the nuclear fuel contained therein, and that when the
                        matter was last discussed in the <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> in
                        July 1947 several nations, including Canada, thought that the nuclear fuel
                        ought not to be destroyed.</p>
                    <p>I told Mr. Osborn that in his forthcoming press conference, the Secretary
                        might refer inquiries on the future course of <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1"
                            >UNAEC</gloss> to Mr. Osborn. Mr. Osborn said that he would be prepared
                        and would welcome such an opportunity, and that if the question were asked
                        as to what next steps were contemplated he would say that if the minority
                        showed a readiness to moderate its resistance to the majority plan, this
                        would be an example of the state of affairs which would be necessary to
                        warrant resumption.</p>
                    <p>He also indicated that for his part he would like to say that such a move by
                        the Soviets would be one indication of a genuine desire to improve relations
                        with the United States. (The Secretary was not questioned on this matter; I
                        believe that we can safely use the Atomic Energy Commission as an example of
                        what the Secretary described “as fields when action is possible and urgently
                        necessary at the present time … matters before the Security Council,
                            etc.”<note n="4" xml:id="d198fn4">This quotation is taken from the
                            Secretary of State’s press and rad<gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> news

                            relations.</note>)</p>
                    <p>I cited the remote possibility that Gromyko might choose this moment to
                        announce some real or pertinent concession to the majority views. Mr. Osborn
                        said that if this were done he would refer to the two years in which the
                        Soviet had had an opportunity to make some offer and state that the Russians
                        would have ample opportunity to present it, and the nations to consider it,
                        in the Security Council debate which was coming up. I observed that if, in
                        the unlikely event that Gromyko should offer anything which, in Mr. Osborn’s
                        judgment, was really a concession, the latter would, no doubt, consider with
                        the majority whether the vote on the Third Report should be postponed.</p>

                    <p>At their request, Messrs. Maclean and Henderson of the British Embassy called
                        on me this morning and left the attached <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi>
                        (595/–/48, dated May 18, 1948). I asked Messrs. Gullion, Elliott and Leith
                        to be present at the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Upon finishing a reading of the attached <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi>,
                        I asked Mr. Gullion if he felt he wished to make any comments or any
                        observations at the present time. I said that so far as I was concerned I
                        would wish to have an opportunity to re-read the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Aide-Mémoire</hi> and reflect upon it before making any comment. Mr.
                        Gullion remarked that he too thought that the matter raised by the <hi
                            rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi> should be thoroughly “ingested” in the
                        Department before any reaction was forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Elliott asked if a similar <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi> were being
                        left with governments of the other members of the Atomic Energy Commission
                        majority. Mr. Maclean replied that only the French Government was being
                        approached.</p>
                    <p>Before concluding the discussion, Mr. Gullion inquired whether either Mr.
                        Maclean or Mr. Henderson was familiar with the study program which the
                        Foreign Office may be undertaking with respect to international atomic
                        energy control. Mr. Maclean replied that he was familiar only in a general
                        way; that the British Government would be reviewing the situation before the
                        next session of the General Assembly. At this point Mr. Henderson
                        interjected a comment that he was not clear whether paragraph 7 of the <hi
                            rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi> referred to a survey by the British
                        Government alone or by the British <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0363"
                        />and United States Governments. He said he was inclined to the latter
                        interpretation.</p>
                    <p>I said that the Department would give this prompt attention and that we would
                        be in touch with the British Embassy when we were prepared to comment.</p>

                                to the British Embassy, May 25, the Department of State acknowledged
                                receipt of the present document and requested information on the
                                nature of the action which the British Government would hope the

                        </head>
                        <p>The British Foreign Secretary has been reviewing the stage now reached in
                            the work of the Atomic Energy Commission, the Commission for
                            Conventional Armaments, and of the Military Staff Committee on the
                            agreements prescribed in Article 43 of the United Nations Charter.</p>
                        <p>2. As the United States Government is aware, the Atomic Energy Commission
                            is now considering a report to be made to the Security Council to the
                            general effect that no further progress in its present task can be
                            achieved without an improvement in the international situation and
                            recommending that the matter be brought to the attention of the General
                            Assembly (the Commission’s Parent Body).</p>
                        <p>3. The United States Government will be aware that in existing
                            circumstances no real progress is likely to be achieved in their
                            allotted tasks either by (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the Commission for
                            Conventional Armaments or by (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the Military
                            Staff Committee. As to (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) it appears highly
                            improbable that the Commission will agree on a report on the basic
                            principles on which a system of disarmament should be reached, failing
                            which there seems no use in taking up further items in the Commission’s
                            plan of work. As to (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the Military Staff
                            Committee has failed to reach agreement on several of the most important
                            of the general principles which it has formulated as requiring agreement
                            before the individual agreements between members of the United Nations
                            and the Security Council postulated in Article 43 can be drawn up. Its
                            report has for several months been before the Security Council which has
                            made little progress and shows no signs of making more. Discussion in
                            the Committee on the strength of the proposed security forces has also
                            failed to produce agreement and can hardly be usefully prolonged.</p>

                                of State for Foreign Affairs.</note> considers that if these three
                            bodies, in the circumstances described above, merely go on in their
                            present grooves, not only <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0364"/>can
                            no useful result be achieved, but the United Nations will be discredited
                            and the all-important issues at stake will become befogged and belittled
                            with very serious results. Mr. Bevin thinks therefore the time has come
                            when there ought to be a breathing space as regards work in all three
                            fields, and with this aim he proposes the following procedure.</p>
                        <p>5. During the next few weeks the work of the three bodies on the tasks at
                            present before them shall be allowed to come independently to a
                            standstill. The Security Council should receive successively reports
                            from the three bodies announcing the view of the majority that no
                            further progress can be made, and should thereupon direct those bodies
                            to suspend the work on which they are engaged. There would of course
                            (Mr. Bevin is particularly anxious to make this clear) be no question of
                            suspending the three bodies themselves. It could be recommended that the
                            Security Council report the situation to the next ordinary session of
                            the General Assembly as a matter of special concern.</p>
                        <p>6. In the Security Council Mr. Bevin would propose to instruct Sir A.
                            Cadogan to make it clear that His Majesty’s Government remain most
                            anxious to see progress made on these vital questions of atomic energy,
                            disarmament and security, and that this desire is not diminished by
                            their belief that the present discussions cannot usefully be continued
                            and should therefore be suspended.</p>
                        <p>7. His Majesty’s Government would then be prepared for a major discussion
                            of the issues involved at the General Assembly next autumn and in the
                            meantime they would carefully survey their policy in all three fields
                            with the aim of trying to give a fresh start to the work if conditions
                            at the time of the Assembly permit.</p>
                        <p>8. His Majesty’s Government must of course be ready to counter vigorously
                            accusations by the Soviet Government that the machinery as well as the
                            atmosphere of peace is being destroyed by an organized conspiracy. His
                            Majesty’s Government’s general line on this might fee, as stated above,
                            that they are most anxious to make progress, that no one disputes the
                            right of the Soviet Government to their own views, but that they have so
                            far shown themselves quite unwilling to try to adjust those views to the
                            views of other governments.</p>
                        <p>9. Though not optimistic, Mr. Bevin thinks it is conceivable that the
                            action proposed successively in the three fields in question may have
                            some effect on the Russians in thinking over their policy during the
                            intervening months before the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>10. The British Embassy have been asked to put the foregoing views to the
                            State Department and to express Mr. Bevin’s hope that the State
                            Department will agree to instruct the United States representative in
                            the Security Council on the above lines.</p>

                                        suspension in all three might put sufficient pressure on the

                            <item>Without going into the merits of the case for and against
                                continuance, I am suggesting a third possible course of action
                                between these two alternatives which seems to me worth consideration
                                by the Department in connection with its review of the problem. The
                                proposed interim report of the <gloss target="#t_CCA1"
                                    >C.C.A.</gloss> to the Security Council might state that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_CCA1">C.C.A.</gloss> is continuing its
                                discussions of the remaining items of the plan of work as it has
                                been instructed to do, but in view of the obstructive tactics of the
                                Soviet Union, it must be recognized that it is likely such
                                discussions will have little practical result. Such a statement
                                would, on the one hand, avoid the disadvantage of suspension at this
                                time, but, on the other hand, would achieve much of the objective of
                                suspension as conceived by the British by calling attention to
                                repetition in the <gloss target="#t_CCA1">C.C.A.</gloss> of tactics
                                employed by the Soviet in the <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1"

                            <item>In a recent informal talk with Mr. Miles of the United Kingdom

                                responsibility for failure in this organ would likewise be theirs.
                                (The suggestion was, of course, made on an informal basis as my own
                                impromptu suggestion which I have not yet discussed with my

                    <p>361. For Osborn. In <gloss target="#t_RAC1">RAC</gloss> meeting on May 24 it
                        was agreed that present policy favoring continuance of <gloss

                    <p>It was also agreed that <gloss target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss> should vote on
                        Item 2 and submit a Report to the Security Council prior to the next regular
                        session of the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> with a conclusion along the
                        following lines:</p>
                    <p>In accordance with the Security Council’s instructions the Commission will
                        continue its discussion of the remaining items of the Plan of Work. However,
                        the Commission feels obliged to inform the Council that the Soviet Union has
                        been unable to agree with the majority on principles considered by the
                        majority to be basic to the regulation of armaments. Until such agreement is
                        obtained, it is unlikely that the Commission will be able to formulate plans
                        for the establishment of a system for the regulation of armaments which will
                        be generally acceptable.</p>

                    <p>The Department of State refers to the <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi> of
                        the British Embassy dated May 18 (595/-/48) and the Department’s
                        acknowledgment of May 25<note n="1" xml:id="d202fn1">See footnote 3, <ref
                                target="#pg_343">p. 343</ref>.</note> concerning the proposal of the
                        British Government for a course of action to be taken in the United Nations
                        with respect to atomic energy control, regulation of conventional armaments,
                        and the agreements prescribed in Article 43 of the Charter.</p>
                    <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0367"/>
                    <p>2. The Department is now in a position to give its views respecting a course
                        of action to be followed in the Commission for Conventional Armaments.</p>
                    <p>3. While agreeing with the desirability of the objective stated in paragraph
                        9 of the British <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi>, the Department does
                        not share the view that steps should be taken to suspend the work of the
                        Commission for Conventional Armaments prior to the next session of the
                        General Assembly.</p>
                    <p>4. The Department agrees that the Commission for Conventional Armaments
                        should report to the Security Council before the next session of the General
                        Assembly. In view of paragraph 3 above, however, it is believed that such a
                        report should be <hi rend="italic">interim</hi> in character. It might
                        state, <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>, that in accordance with the
                        Security Council’s instructions the Commission will continue its discussions
                        of the remaining items of the Plan of Work; that the majority of the members
                        feel obliged to inform the Security Council that the Soviet Union has been
                        unable to agree with the majority on principles considered by the majority
                        to be basic to the regulation of armaments; and that until such agreement is
                        obtained, it is unlikely that the Commission will be able to formulate plans
                        for the establishment of a system for the regulation of armaments which will
                        be generally acceptable. Such a statement would avoid possible disadvantages
                        of suspension at this time, but nevertheless would achieve much of the
                        objective of suspension as conceived by the British Government by calling
                        attention to a repetition by the Soviet Union in the Commission for
                        Conventional Armaments of the obstructive tactics it has employed in the
                        United Nations Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
                    <p>5. The remaining questions raised by the United Kingdom in its note are still
                        under consideration. The British Embassy will be advised as promptly as
                        possible of the results of this consideration.</p>

                    <p>382. Following is the position to be followed by this Govt with respect to
                        Third Report of <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss>:<note n="1"
                            xml:id="d203fn1">The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission transmitted
                            its Third Report to the Security Council on May 26. The Council
                            considered it at its 318th, 321st, and 325th Meetings, June 11, 16, and
                            22. Philip C. Jessup, Deputy United States Representative, opened the
                            discussion, commending the Commission for having developed the majority
                            plan of international control. He noted that the refusal of the Soviet
                            Union to accept that plan was not due to the fact that the plan was
                            ineffective but rather that it was regarded as an infringement of
                            national sovereignty. On behalf of the United States, he then submitted
                            a draft resolution very nearly identical with that contained in the
                            present telegram. For text of Jessup’s address and the United States
                            resolution, see United Nations, <hi rend="italic">Official Records of

                            798–799. <p>On June 22, the Council voted in favor of the resolution 9
                                to 2 (the Soviet Union and the Ukraine). Following that vote, which
                                represented a veto by the Soviet Union, the Canadian Delegation
                                introduced a resolution calling merely for the transmittal of the
                                1st, 2nd, and 3rd <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> Reports to
                                the General assembly. This resolution was adopted 9–0, the Soviet
                                Union and the Ukraine abstaining.</p>

                            such a statement is made, it would be unnecessary to have a vote on the

                        <item>The foregoing suggests that an effort should be made to strengthen the

                            contemplated in the Charter and to respond to public opinion in this
                            regard. The objectives we have hitherto sought will be a fundamentally
                            sound thesis in terms of establishing an effective international force
                            as originally contemplated. Viewed in this light the creation of such a
                            force would be designed to meet the double objective of contributing to
                            an international sense of security and facilitating subsequent national
                            limitation of armament.</item>

                        <item>It is not anticipated, however, that agreement will be reached with
                            the Russians in any substantial way which would make possible the
                            creation of such an effective international force in the immediately
                            foreseeable future. On the contrary, as in the case of atomic energy,
                            conventional armaments, and other matters, it is very doubtful if the
                            Russians, despite their recent show of making concessions which are in
                            fact not very substantial, would be willing to agree to the
                            establishment of armed forces except on a basis falling short of what
                            was contemplated in the Charter. An agreement on such basis, which might
                            have plausible aspects, would be misleading and deceptive and thus give
                            false assurances to the public.</item>

                            serve either our national interests or the interests of international
                            peace and security to push forward to conclusion along lines hitherto
                            followed the Article 43 agreements, thus raising the consequent risk of
                            Soviet forces being used in certain areas of the world. Presumably, the
                            US would not want to be in the position of using its veto to prevent the
                            utilization of force in such areas because of an unwillingness to have
                            Soviet forces participate.</item>

                        <item>Although, as indicated above, there is widespread public opinion
                            feeling that some action should be taken to provide the <gloss

                        <item>From the point of view of considering possible action in the <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> or in the <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss> this year on this subject, it seems necessary to
                            contemplate the possibility of Soviet initiative in raising this issue.
                            If the issue were publicly raised either on Soviet or on any other
                            initiative it is believed that the US is in a position to make a good
                            case. Our case would not be as strong as it is in connection with the
                            report of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> where we are able to
                            point to our complete agreement with the powers other than Russia.
                            However, we can build strongly on our basic thesis that we have
                            throughout contended for the establishment of a really effective
                            international force while the Russians have consistently attempted to
                            establish a small force which would be clearly ineffective. It is
                            possible also for us in any public discussion of the <gloss
                                target="#t_MSC1">MSC</gloss> considerations of overall strength to
                            point to the fact that we are in very close agreement with the UK,
                            France and China on most items and that throughout we have made
                            considerable concessions, whereas the Soviet Union is out of line with
                            the other four powers in most categories and has throughout made
                            practically no concessions. In particular the US, UK, France and China
                            are in agreement on the basic principles reported by the <gloss
                                target="#t_MSC1">MSC</gloss> to the <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> last summer. As we see it, the only weakness in our
                            position from the point of view of public argument is that our estimates
                            of necessary air strength while reduced from our original estimates by a
                            thousand planes is still out of line with the UK, France and China.
                            Those three powers have increased their figures in an attempt to meet
                            ours but the disparity is still great. On the other hand, the Soviet
                            Union has made no variation in its overall estimates although it has
                            made a show of concessions through a redistribution in the various
                            categories. It would undoubtedly strengthen our position if it were
                            possible for us to revise our air estimates still further downward if by
                            that means we would come closer to agreement with the UK, France and
                            China. If it is assumed as we believe it may properly be, that the
                            establishment of an effective force is not likely, it can be argued that
                            a variation from our position politically despite its fundamental
                            soundness from the military point of view, would not be injurious.
                            Accordingly, a revision downward of our air estimates could be balanced
                            against the ensuing political advantage which would come from presenting
                            a united front all along the line with the UK, France and China.</item>

                        <item>Unless as a considered policy decision it is determined to make some
                            rather significant move in the field of the creation of a <gloss

                            contemplated, or unless such a decision is required for reasons of
                            public policy, it would-seem to be possible to <pb n="353"
                                xml:id="pg_353" facs="0373"/>avoid any deviation from the present
                            line of approach unless the matter is forced by the Soviet Union. If for
                            any of the above reasons some action becomes necessary, it would be
                            possible to resume in the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> the
                            discussion of the basic principles, but in our opinion it would then be
                            impossible to avoid a discussion of the estimates of overall strength.
                            If it becomes necessary to discuss this matter, the US is in a
                            fundamentally sound position from the point of view of public relations
                            and discussions in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> but could
                            greatly strengthen that position if the air estimates could be

                        <item>Holding to our original line of approach in this matter, as indicated
                            in the preceding paragraph, may well not be adequate in the light of our
                            own public opinion and opinion in the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>.
                            For reasons indicated above, it would seem neither feasible nor
                            realistic to deviate substantially from the objectives we have hitherto
                            sought if we are seeking the creation of Article 43 forces as originally
                            contemplated. However, in order to be in a position to deal in a
                            positive and affirmative manner with this question in the <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> should the necessity arise, we feel that
                            it is important to develop positions with regard to the two alternatives
                            set forth in the following paragraphs, namely, a <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> token force and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> armed
                            guards or a combination of both.</item>
                        <label>9.</label>
                        <item>If a basic policy decision were reached that the participation of the
                            Soviet Union in an international token force would not necessarily lead
                            to undesirable consequences, or if an irresistible public opinion:
                            seemed to require some action even at the cost of undesirable Russian
                            participation in certain areas, consideration might then be given to the
                            possibility of the creation of a small symbolic force. Such a force
                            would not be conceived or presented as one capable of really effective
                            military action in many situations which might be conceived. Such a
                            force, however, might, from the general point of view of support for
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> action, be useful as, e.g., in
                            supporting economic sanctions under Articles 41 and 42 or through
                            providing sea and air patrols in support of blockade measures. The
                            development of such an idea would need clearly to be based upon
                            political rather than military considerations. From the technical point
                            of view, agreement might conceivably be reached upon the establishment
                            of such a symbolic force through the contribution of a very small number
                            of naval vessels including one or more from each of a number of the
                            middle or smaller powers. A danger of experimentation with such an
                            approach would be that it might play into the hands of the Soviet
                            contention in favor of a small international force and might block
                            eventual development of a substantial effective force. The danger would
                            also have to be considered of creating a false sense of security and of
                            involving a token force in situation which would require subsequent
                            reinforcement which would not be available, <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354"

                            being to public agitation for some action. It is doubtful whether
                            contingents furnished under Article 43 agreements should ever be used
                            merely for guarding <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> personnel or

                            commissions in the field. Certainly such a function is not their primary
                            responsibility. On the other hand, it is clear that <gloss

                        Energy Reports in the General Assembly this fall.</p>
                    <p>Everyone agreed that the majority nations on the <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                            >AEC</gloss> must urge the General Assembly to approve the General
                        Findings and Recommendations <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0375"/>of the
                        First Report; the Specific Proposals of the Second Report, and the Report
                        and Recommendations of the Third Report. Anything less would represent a
                        failure to endorse the arduous work of the Atomic Energy Commission and the
                        action taken by the Security Council. It was felt, however, that the General
                        Assembly might be unwilling to vote for the suspension of negotiations in
                        the Atomic Energy Commission unless they could make some constructive
                        proposal to accompany the suspension. It was suggested that after the
                        General Assembly had voted approval of the first three Reports it might
                        then, vote a resolution instructing the sponsoring powers to get together
                        and report back to the General Assembly at its next meeting on whether they
                        had been able to reach any basis for agreement. This would give the General
                        Assembly a chance to keep its hands on the situation. It would put the onus
                        on the Soviet for refusing further negotiations; or, if they did agree to
                        meet with the sponsoring powers, it would be on the basis of the first three
                        Reports.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that this suggestion should be talked over with the Delegates
                        of Canada, the U.K. and France.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Henderson called this morning and said that he and Mr. Maclean wished to
                        come in for further discussion with Mr. Blaisdell and me on Conventional
                        Armaments and on Article 43. (Mr. Howard Johnson is writing up the portion
                        of the conversation pertaining to Article 43.) In Mr. Blaisdell’s absence, I
                        asked Mr. Howard Johnson to attend the meeting.</p>
                    <p>Messrs. Henderson and Maclean opened the conversation by saying they wanted
                        to be certain that we understood exactly what their proposal is. They
                        stressed that the Foreign Office desires to have the work of the
                        Conventional Armaments Commission suspended or adjourned <pb n="356"
                            xml:id="pg_356" facs="0376"/>until after the Assembly and that it is not
                        the British desire to have the Commission itself suppressed or terminated.
                        We explained that we understood that position.</p>
                    <p>They then gave us some information as to the British thinking as to what the
                        Assembly may do in this field. They stressed that they do not have in mind
                        in the Assembly merely a condemnation of the Russians. They thought the
                        Assembly should perhaps pass a resolution enjoining the Commission to resume
                        work and redouble its efforts in this field. Attached is an extract from a
                        Foreign Office telegram giving this view. They look on the matter as largely
                        a question of tactics rather than as a question of fundamental principle and
                        they realize that, except for some difference of views as to what the best
                        tactics would be, there is no great difference between their position and
                        ours.</p>
                    <p>As to the matter of tactics, they feel that because we have advocated
                        suspending the work of the Atomic Energy Commission where we are in a
                        stronger position and would be giving up more, and continuing: the work of
                        the Conventional Armaments Commission where the Russians are perhaps in the
                        stronger position and would be asked to give up, we are presenting the
                        Russians with an effective debating point.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Johnson and I raised the question as to whether the formula outlined in
                        our note of June 10, in answer to the British <hi rend="italic"
                            >aide-mémoire</hi>, of calling attention to the impasse without
                        suspending work did not, in a large measure, meet what the Foreign Office
                        has in mind. They replied that the British have considered this formula and
                        concluded that it did not meet their objectives. Mr. Henderson, after Mr.
                        Maclean had left, read further from his Foreign Office telegram to the
                        effect that, despite our view, the British propose to instruct Cadogan to
                        advocate suspension.</p>
                    <p>We talked in some detail about the advantages of our formula, the possibility
                        if suspension would not give the Russians even a more effective debating
                        point than the one the British predict, and about the undesirability of
                        pointing up Conventional Armaments in the Assembly. We explained that this
                        is a field where we are more vulnerable than in that of atomic energy. We
                        added that the Russians always try to confuse and mix up the two. We
                        wondered, therefore, if we were not in a stronger position to stress atomic
                        energy, and not to have Conventional Armaments on the agenda as a special
                        item.</p>
                    <p>We concluded the matter by stating that we would like to review our position
                        in the light of the additional information which the British had given us
                        with respect to their thinking as to possible Assembly action on this
                        subject.</p>

                        <p>2. At the worst the kind of resolution which would be required would be
                            one which, whilst regretting the lack of progress hitherto made, urged
                            the redoubling of efforts. Whether something more constructive can be
                            suggested cannot at present be forecast. We shall be considering this
                            carefully in the meantime and hope that the Americans will do likewise
                            and let us have the benefit of their thinking as we will let them have
                            that of ours. What however we have been aiming at throughout is a frank
                            public recognition of the fact that the present desultory discussions
                            are useless and misleading at the moment. We wish to secure an
                            adjournment so that all concerned may have a breathing space for
                            consideration with the aim of trying to get a concerted plan to restart
                            discussions after a lead has been given at the General Assembly.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Henderson and Mr. Maclean visited the Department at their request on the
                        subject of Conventional Armaments and Article 43 forces, the first of which
                        is being handled by a separate memorandum.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Henderson read an instruction from London to the effect that the Soviet
                        Union would probably not oppose a report of the Military Staff Committee to
                        the Security Council to the effect that no further progress can be made in
                        the Military Staff Committee until the Security Council resolves the general
                        principles. The Foreign Office would like to have the Security Council meet
                        once or twice during the summer on the subject of general principles in
                        order to see if there were any prospect of reaching agreement. If this
                        failed the Foreign Office suggested adjournment of the work of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on this subject, including the Military Staff
                        Committee, until after the General Assembly. He indicated that in the view
                        of the Foreign Office the Soviet <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0378"
                        />Union might try to obtain a Security Council discussion of overall
                        strength and that the British Government, principally out of deference to
                        the minority position of the United States, wished to avoid such
                        discussions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Johnson asked Mr. Henderson if he could give any indication of the
                        attitude of the British Government toward the General Assembly handling of
                        this question. He also inquired whether or not the British Government felt
                        that this was the time to take additional steps toward the implementation of
                        Article 43.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Henderson was told that the United States hopes to be able to discuss
                        this matter with the British Government within ten days or two weeks. Mr.
                        Henderson pointed out the urgency of the situation in view of the likelihood
                        that the Military Staff Committee on July 1 would decide to submit its
                        report to the Council.</p>

                    <p>According to a memorandum, dated March 26, 1948, to Mr. Lovett from Mr.

                        Charter, the Secretary indicated that subject to the views of the Under
                        Secretary the Policy Planning Staff should consider whether the United
                        States should submit an offer of the forces it will make available to the
                        United Nations Security Council. Mr. Lovett subsequently approved of a
                        suggested Planning Staff study.</p>

                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The House Committee on Foreign Affairs
                            proposed at the recent session a bill with a provision advocating
                            “Agreements to provide the United Nations with armed forces as
                            contemplated in the Charter”. In reporting out this bill, the House
                            Committee on Foreign Affairs stated that “the failure to provide the
                            Security Council with contingents of the armed forces of the member
                            nations as an instrument for maintaining peace and security has been a
                            negative default of obligations imposed by the Charter”; that
                            “Implementation of article 43 is a <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi>
                            to effective functioning of the Security Council.”</p>
                        <p>(3) The Soviet Government, on June 3, 1948, proposed several small
                            changes in the Soviet estimate of armed forces to be provided under
                            Article 43, apparently designed to bring their estimates closer to those
                            of the other four permanent members of the Security Council.
                            Specifically, they brought their ground forces estimate in line with <pb
                                n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0380"/>that of all the other members
                            of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Military Staff Committee. In
                            naval force categories other than battleships and aircraft carriers they
                            brought their estimates substantially in line with the other estimates.
                            In the category of air forces, without changing their total figure, they
                            revised their figures on bombers, fighters and miscellaneous in order to
                            bring them more closely in line with those of the British, French, and
                            Chinese. The purpose of this appears to be to make more conspicuous the
                            difference between the air estimates of the United States and the much
                            smaller estimates of the other four.</p>
                        <p>(4) Executive authority to negotiate agreements to make United States
                            armed forces available to the United Nations Security Council is
                            provided in Section 6 of the “United Nations Participation Act of 1945”
                            (Public Law 264—79th Congress), which reads in part as follows:</p>

                                    contrary the Charter specifically states that the agreements

                                    of the Security Council.” On the other hand, there is nothing in
                                    the Charter which would inhibit our taking such a step. (See

                                        Gross, in response to Kennan’s query, rendered the opinion
                                        that an offer of forces would be consistent with the United
                                        Nations Charter.</note>)</item>

                                <item>There is no positive consideration of national interest
                                    involved. On the contrary, the Policy Planning Staff considers
                                    it generally dangerous to U.S. interests for the Security
                                    Council to attempt to employ armed force in order to assert its
                                    security powers in the present state of international relations.
                                    The Kremlin has no abstract interest in the maintenance of peace
                                    and security. The Soviet leaders do nothing in foreign affairs
                                    which is not apt, in their opinion, to contribute to the
                                    strengthening of the position of the international communist
                                    movement at the expense of the position of the leading members
                                    of the western community of nations. If, therefore, in a given
                                    instance, the U.S.S.R. were to choose not to exercise its veto
                                    over a proposal to use <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0381"

                                    matter, this could be only because it had decided that such
                                        <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action would be apt to
                                    have the effect, in the last analysis, of furthering
                                    international communist purposes. In any joint undertakings for
                                    the use of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> facilities in
                                    security matters, the western powers are therefore betting
                                    against the Kremlin on the ultimate repercussions of such

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Elliott</hi>; This confirms our telephone
                        conversation of today. In conferences with the British Delegation day before
                        yesterday, and with General McNaughton and George Ignatieff of the Canadian
                        Delegation today, the following plan for the handling of atomic energy in
                        the General Assembly was developed, as the best method of getting a
                        satisfactory discussion in the General Assembly and a satisfactory Tote.</p>
                    <p>It would be proposed to introduce a resolution at the start of the debate,
                        under which resolution the General Assembly would— <list>

                                constituting the essential basis for effective international control
                                of atomic energy. (The exact wording of the latter part was not
                                agreed on and may provide some difficulties, particularly with the
                                British.)</item>

                                meeting.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>The introduction of such a resolution at the start would make it clear that
                        the General Assembly was not proposing to lose control of the situation, but
                        was simply referring the matter back to diplomatic channels, for which there
                        is good precedent. It is felt that the smaller nations particularly would be
                        pleased with this solution. If such a resolution were voted by the General
                        Assembly the Soviet would be forced either to enter negotiations on the
                        basis of the majority reports or refuse to negotiate and thus defy the
                        mandate of the General Assembly.</p>
                    <p>We would appreciate your views on this proposal and will be glad of an
                        opportunity to work with you on the exact wording of the resolution, about
                        which there may be some difficulty.</p>
                    <p>It was further proposed that the first presentation and the introduction of
                        the resolution should be made by the United States Delegate. General
                        McNaughton feels very strongly about this. As Canada is probably the only
                        other nation whom we can be entirely sure will handle the thing in the right
                        way, it will probably be necessary to take General McNaughton’s advice and
                        have the United States take the initiative.</p>
                    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

                            Conventional Armaments</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is understood that both Governments agree that a report should be made by
                            <gloss target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss> to the Security Council at an early
                        date. The only difference of view appears to lie in the conclusion of the
                        report and the action to be taken on it by the Security Council. The UK has
                        suggested that the report announce the view of the majority that no further
                        progress can be made and that the Security Council should direct the
                        Commission to suspend its work. The United States, on the other hand, is of
                        the opinion that the report should conclude that:</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>“In accordance with the Security Council’s instructions the Commission
                            will continue its discussion of the remaining items of the Plan of Work.
                            However, the Commission feels obliged to inform the Council that the
                            Soviet Union has been unable to agree with the majority on principles
                            considered by the majority to be basic to the regulation of armaments.
                            Until such agreement is obtained, it is unlikely that the Commission
                            will be able to formulate plans for the establishment of a system for
                            the regulation of armaments which will be generally acceptable.”</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>It is the US view that upon submission of the report to the Security Council,
                        the Commission should decide, as it did last year, not to meet until after
                        the General Assembly. The practical result of temporary suspension will be
                        the same under either plan.</p>
                    <p>Thus, the only difference appears to be one of the emphasis to be placed on
                        what is agreed to be only a temporary suspension until after the General
                        Assembly. The U.S. feels, however, that there are important reasons to avoid
                        placing public emphasis upon this temporary suspension by formalizing it: <list>

                        Nations Charter.]</p>
                    <p>5. It does not seem to me that a pressure campaign to get something done
                        about the Article 43 Agreements (which, as indicated above, I doubt would be
                        successful in any event) is very relevant to effective dealing with the
                        principal political problems confronting us. These may be divided into two
                        categories as follows: <list>

                            <item>With regard to the major problems confronting us, Berlin, for
                                example, I do not see that Article 43 forces would be of any use to
                                us in the present situation even if we had them. I cannot envisage
                                any set of circumstances involving major political problems between
                                the Soviet <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0386"/>Union and the
                                so-called western democracies with regard to which it would make the
                                slightest difference whether or not we had the Article 43
                                forces.</item>

                            <item>With regard to other international political problems, e.g.,
                                Palestine, Kashmir, Indonesia, Greece, Korea, these are on the whole
                                all being dealt with with reasonable effectiveness by the United
                                Nations, and I do not think it likely that we could deal with these
                                questions with any greater effectiveness if we had the Article 43
                                forces. In the present state of political relationships, it is
                                virtually certain that either we or the Russians would prevent the
                                employment of Article 43 forces if we had them in the settlement of
                                these secondary political issues.</item>

                    <p>6. With regard to the stage which has been reached in the development of the
                        United Nations, I do not feel that pressure for the Article 43 Agreements is
                        in tune for the following reasons: <list>
                            <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                            <item>It has seemed to me for some time past that there is an
                                inescapable correlation between the international control of atomic
                                energy, the reduction of conventional armaments, and creation of
                                Article 43 forces. Without developing this point in further detail,
                                it seems to me that we should not follow a policy with regard to any
                                one of these which is inconsistent with our policy with regard to
                                the other two. We do not expect and we are not pressing for any
                                substantial accomplishment in the atomic energy and conventional
                                armaments field, the primary reason being the present state of
                                relations between the Soviet Union and the western democracies. It
                                seems to me, therefore, that we should key our Article 43 policy
                                with our policy on the other two instead of, to mix the metaphor,
                                taking off on a different tack.</item>

                            <item>From the political viewpoint, the United Nations has just barely
                                readied in the Palestine case the stage of Chapter VII action.<note
                                    n="2" xml:id="d211fn2">Reference is to Chapter VII of the United

                                very gingerly; quite apart from the views of the Members on the
                                merits of the Palestine issue, a number of Members of the Council
                                were noticeably reluctant to move into Chapter VII. This political
                                diffidence, I am sure, will continue for some time and its
                                continuance will be in large measure dependent upon the continuance
                                of strained relations between the Soviet Union and the rest of the
                                world. Given the Palestine precedent, it is conceivable that in
                                other cases (Kashmir, Indonesia) the Security Council might the more
                                readily again take Chapter VII action limited to a finding of a
                                threat to the peace and the issuance of orders to the parties
                                appropriate to the circumstances. I have very great doubt, however,
                                whether the Council or the governments composing the Council are
                                likely in the predictable future to be at all prepared to move very
                                far beyond such action. In brief, therefore, I do not see what we
                                have to gain at the moment politically from pressing to make the
                                Article 43 forces available.</item>

                    <p>7. From the domestic political viewpoint we should, of course, pay due regard
                        to the expressed views of the Congress. On the other hand, we should bear in
                        mind that the Congress which expressed those views, will no longer be with
                        us next January. It would seem to me to involve less domestic political
                        confusion if we bide our time on the Article 43 question until next January
                        when we will have to work certainly with a new Congress and possibly with a
                        new Administration.</p>
                    <p>8. It seems to me that the wise course to follow is a simple one aimed at
                        initiating a policy enunciated in general terms at the Assembly this fall
                        and carefully prepared and built up during the course of the ensuing year
                        with the New Congress, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, in the
                        Military Staff Committee and the Security Council. I would certainly feel
                        that in the Secretary’s initial speech at the Assembly he should deal in two
                        or three paragraphs in very strong terms with the question of armed forces,
                        fixing the blame on the Russians’ failure to accomplish more in this
                            field.<note n="3" xml:id="d211fn3">On June 23, 1948, the Military Staff
                            Committee had completed its consideration of the report of its

                            23, 1947), but failed to achieve unanimity with respect to it. On July

                                <p>Subsequently, the Committee was unable to agree on the course of
                                its future work. On August 6, the United States, United Kingdom,
                                French and Chinese Delegations submitted a letter to the President
                                of the Security Council reiterating the view that the <gloss

                                Security Council took action with respect to general principles. On
                                August 16, however, in a similar letter, the Soviet Delegation
                                expressed the opinion that the <gloss target="#t_MSC1">MSC</gloss>

                            <p>The Military Staff Committee continued to meet as a matter of course
                                during the remainder of the year, but no further substantive
                                discussion occurred on the subject of forces to be provided under
                                Article 43 of the Charter. No other organ of the United Nations
                                concerned itself with the question during the second half of 1948.
                                Secretary Marshall’s address during the general debate phase of the
                                first part of the Third Session of the General Assembly, September
                                23, mentioned Article 43 forces only in passing.</p>

                    <p>9. A practical and progressive step we might take this fall would, be to take
                        over Trygve Lie’s armed guard idea<note n="4" xml:id="d211fn4">For
                            documentation on United States policy with respect to the
                            Secretary-General’s proposal for the creation of a United Nations armed
                            guard force, see <ref target="#pg_311">pp. 311</ref> ff.</note> and
                        press it through. It is clear to me that we have reached the stage in the
                        political development of the United Nations where a <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss> guard, if available, could perform a very useful service. I
                        do not mean to imply that we should, in any way let it be assumed that we
                        feel that a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> armed guard would be a
                        substitute for the Article 43 forces. We should rather make very clear the
                        distinction between the two. The creation of such a guard <pb n="368"
                            xml:id="pg_368" facs="0388"/>would, however, in my opinion, represent a
                        step towards the strengthening of the United Nations by providing a type of
                        police force which, although not specifically contemplated in the Charter,
                        experience has demonstrated there is a need for. It is very clear to me also
                        that such action by the United Nations, pursuant to leadership by the United
                        States, would be strongly supported publicly.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The first part of the discussion related to the handling of the atomic energy
                        debate in the General Assembly in Paris. Cadogan stated that the General
                        Assembly should vote approval of the plan developed by the Atomic Energy
                        Commission. He suggested that the resolution should be similar to the
                        resolution voted on in the Security Council and vetoed by the Soviet. Osborn
                        asked who should present the resolution and pointed out that if it was
                        presented by the United States, the Soviet Union would claim that the United
                        States again was attempting to coerce the other powers. Parodi then said he
                        felt strongly that all the states which are or have been members of the
                        Atomic Energy Commission voting with the majority should jointly sponsor the
                        resolution. On discussion all those present agreed.</p>
                    <p>DeRose then said that he believed the Soviet Union might make the whole
                        debate on the question of suspension instead of on the question of the
                        approval of the report. Osborn said if this likely attempt took place,
                        undoubtedly some of the smaller nations would desire to introduce a
                        resolution in the General Assembly instructing the sponsoring powers to get
                        together and report to the General Assembly at their next Meeting. If such a
                        resolution were introduced the United States would go along with it. DeRose
                        said that such a resolution might be in the form of an amendment to the main
                        resolution. Osborn said that this would be all right. The United States
                        would go along with such an amendment, but thought it most inadvisable that
                        such an amendment or resolution should be originally sponsored by any of the
                        major states.</p>
                    <p>McNaughton suggested that Brazil might suggest such an amendment, but Parodi
                        and deRose felt that it should be done by some outside country not
                        participating in the resolution, such as Norway or some other Nordic state.
                        Cadogan agreed and McNaughton said he was willing to go along with this
                        point of view.</p>
                    <p>There was some discussion as to whether arrangements for the introduction of
                        such a resolution or amendment should be made in advance or whether it could
                        be allowed to develop when we get to Paris. The general view was expressed
                        that it could be allowed to develop when we get together in Paris.</p>
                    <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0391"/>
                    <p>Osborn then advised of the action of the State Department in sending an
                        airgram to its diplomatic representatives in a number of countries
                        instructing them to inform the foreign offices to which they were accredited
                        that the General Assembly would be asked to vote on the question of
                        approving the reports of the Atomic Energy Commission, and that they should
                        study the matter carefully so they would know how they were going to vote
                        and be prepared to take an intelligent part in the debate.</p>
                    <p>Osborn then said that if agreeable, he would approach the delegations of the
                        States not present at this meeting and who were, or had been, members of the
                        Atomic Energy Commission, to ask them to join in sponsoring the resolution.
                        Osborn then presented a proposed form of resolution, given below, which is
                        in accordance with the Department’s telegram of July 27, No. 5938:<note

                            resolution.”</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>Osborn stated that the last paragraph was submitted simply for their
                        consideration, but all of those present said they liked it and would
                        consider whether any changes were necessary.</p>
                    <p>Cadogan suggested that Osborn defer his conversations with the other
                        Delegations until the four delegates present had heard from their
                        governments approving their joining in this resolution. Cadogan said he
                        would require only three days, but Parodi said he would want a week to get
                        in touch with his government and would be ready for another conference next
                        Wednesday or Thursday. Osborn said accordingly he would wait until they had
                        heard from their governments before approaching the other Delegations.</p>
                    <p>The meeting then turned to the consideration of the Commission for
                        Conventional Armaments. Osborn said that he was preparing a statement for
                        the press for use in Monday’s papers, refuting the articles in <pb n="372"
                            xml:id="pg_372" facs="0392"/>yesterday’s <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>
                        and <hi rend="italic">Herald Tribune</hi> to the effect that the Commission
                        for Conventional Armaments was to be discontinued.<note n="8"
                            xml:id="d213fn8">For the substance of the statement, see telegram 492 to
                            New York, July 30, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>Cadogan said he hoped that in such a statement the United States would make
                        it clear that there was little hope for progress in the Commission for
                        Conventional Armaments because of Soviet intransigence. Osborn said he would
                        go over the proposed statement with Mr. Falla of the United Kingdom. Cadogan
                        said that the subject of suspension of the work of the Commission for
                        Conventional Armaments had been discussed recently by the British Embassy
                        and the State Department. He would, however, take up with the Foreign Office
                        the subject of today’s discussion and ask for instructions.</p>
                    <p>Parodi then said that the French position on the Commission for Conventional
                        Armaments is different from that just expressed by Sir Alexander, and that
                        he will not easily get his government to change their position; that the
                        Commission for Conventional Armaments must not quit and that there is no
                        reason to add one more tension with the U.S.S.R. at this time. Further, it
                        would weaken the position and effectiveness of the Commission for
                        Conventional Armaments to make such a statement now. In atomic energy the
                        situation is quite different, and the French fully agree with the action of
                        the majority in which they have joined. In atomic energy a great amount of
                        work has been done, much time has been spent on a careful study of all
                        Soviet proposals and clear statements have been made, including all the
                        reasons for the position taken by the majority. Such is not the case in the
                        Commission for Conventional Armaments and a statement attacking the Soviet
                        for their intransigence at this time would therefore not carry proper
                        authority.</p>
                    <p>Osborn said that the position of his government was that the Commission for
                        Conventional Armaments must continue its work and the form of the resolution
                        or letter of transmittal, so long as it included a clear statement to this
                        effect, was largely a matter of agreement between the French and the United
                        Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>McNaughton agreed with Parodi that the work of the Commission for
                        Conventional Armaments has not yet gone far enough to justify pointing the
                        finger of scorn at the Soviet and the Ukraine at this time. To do so now
                        would weaken the position of the Commission for Conventional Armaments when
                        the time comes when they will be forced to report, after much study, that it
                        is evident progress is impossible because of the refusal of the Soviet.
                        Further, that we have not yet got sufficient evidence to justify such an
                        attack on the Soviet.</p>
                    <p>De la Tournelle asked whether the United States was ready to go on with
                        discussions of Items 3, 4 and 5 of the plan of work Osborn said <pb n="373"
                            xml:id="pg_373" facs="0393"/>that the United States was ready to discuss
                        Item 3, but did not desire to go on to Items 4 or 5, as it seemed
                        unrealistic to discuss anything beyond Item 3 until the Soviet showed by
                        their acts that they were serious. Item 3 itself will take some time to
                        discuss and its discussion will carry us well into the winter.</p>
                    <p>McNaughton said that while Canada was willing and anxious to discuss Item 3
                        they certainly did not desire to discuss Item 4 until conditions have
                        totally changed.</p>
                    <p>No decision was taken as to the wording of the interim report to the Security
                        Council. Both Cadogan and Parodi will get in touch with their governments
                        and will try to agree on a form of resolution, which they will then present
                        to a further meeting of the same group.</p>

                        <p>‘The United States … recognizes the importance of regulating conventional
                            armaments. We regret that much more progress has not been made in this
                            field . . . . it is very easy to pay lip service to the sincere
                            aspirations of all peoples for the limitation and reduction of armed
                            forces. This is a serious matter which should not be the subject of
                            demagogic appeals and irresponsible propaganda. I say frankly to the
                            General Assembly that it is the conviction of my Government that a
                            workable system for the regulation of armaments cannot be put into
                            operation until conditions of international confidence prevail. We have
                            consistently and repeatedly made it clear that the regulation of
                            armaments presupposes enough international understanding to make
                            possible the settlement of peace terms with Germany and Japan, the
                            implementation of agreements putting military forces and facilities at
                            the disposal of the Security Council, and an international arrangement

                        <p>Nevertheless, we believe it is important not to delay the formulation of
                            a system of arms regulation for implementation when conditions permit.
                            The Security Council has accepted a logical plan of work for the

                    <p>An informal meeting of members of the United States, United Kingdom, French,
                        Canadian and Chinese Delegations at New York was called by the United States
                        Delegation on the 28th of July to discuss the question of future tactics on
                        the control of atomic energy and disarmament.<note n="1" xml:id="d215fn1"
                            >For Osborn’s memorandum of conversation on that meeting, see <ref

                    </p>
                    <p>2. As regards atomic energy control, the United States representative
                        proposed a draft resolution to be submitted to the General Assembly jointly
                        by the countries that had subscribed to the major decisions of the United
                        Nations Atomic Energy Commission. The resolution would call upon all nations
                        to fulfil their responsibilities to the world community by accepting the
                        necessary basis for effective international control of atomic energy as set
                        forth in the relevant passages of the Atomic Energy Commission’s
                        reports.</p>
                    <p>3. As regards disarmament, the United States Delegation proposed a draft
                            resolution<note n="2" xml:id="d215fn2">For text, see footnote 1, <ref
                                target="#pg_377">p. 377</ref>.</note> for adoption by the Commission
                        on Conventional Armaments calling for the submission to the Security Council
                        as an interim report the records of the Commission’s proceedings and drawing
                        attention to the Soviet and Ukrainian Delegations’ obstruction of the
                        Commission’s work.</p>
                    <p>4. These proposals have doubtless been formulated by the United States
                        Delegation in pursuance of the policy described in the paper handed to the
                        British Embassy in Washington by the State Department on the 9th of July.
                        Under point two in that paper, it was stated that one of the principal
                        objectives of the United States in the coming <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376"
                            facs="0396"/>Assembly would be the adoption by the Assembly of the
                        majority proposals of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission and the
                        belief was expressed that this objective would be furthered by having the
                        least possible public recognition of the problem of Conventional Armaments.
                        Under point ten of the paper it was stated to be the hope of the United
                        States Government that the emphasis in the security field at the General
                        Assembly would be placed on atomic energy.</p>
                    <p>5. The Foreign Office are seriously concerned over these developments, which
                        indicate that the present views of the United States Government on this
                        whole question are at variance with their own.</p>
                    <p>6. The policy which the Foreign Office have hitherto had in mind is to use
                        the attitude of the Soviet Government not only in the Atomic Energy
                        Commission but also in the Conventional Armaments Commission (and, if
                        possible, also in the Military Staff Committee) to show how impossible it is
                        to make progress on all these subjects (whether in the Commissions or in the
                        Security Council itself) so long as the Soviet Government are determined to
                        stick to the letter of their rights on all matters on which they do not see
                        eye to eye with the majority views. The Foreign Office attach high
                        importance to tackling the matter on these lines rather than by attempting
                        the fruitless task of trying to push through the Assembly the majority
                        report of the Atomic Energy Commission by itself. They consider that there
                        is serious objection to making the subject of atomic energy as such a major
                        question at the next Assembly instead of using it as an illustration of a
                        wider thesis. The view of the Foreign Office is that the question of atomic
                        energy disarmament and security should be treated at the Assembly as
                        connected parts of the same major problem, namely, whether the United
                        Nations can make any real progress in such matters (or indeed in any matter
                        coming before the Security Council), so long as certain member governments
                        are unwilling to abandon in any degree in the common interest the letter of
                        their rights under the Charter. This ultimately involves the whole question
                        of the voting position, which of course lies at the root of all the three
                        issues mentioned above as well as of other issues which come before the
                        Security Council.</p>
                    <p>7. It is a matter which, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, requires most
                        careful thought as to handling. The Foreign Office hope to be in a position
                        during the next few weeks to put up some definite proposals for careful
                        study before the Assembly by the Governments who think in the same general
                        way as the British Government about the present abuse of voting rights.
                        Meanwhile, the Foreign Office cannot regard as an adequate or appropriate

                        the United States Delegation in New York.</p>
                    <p>8. It is of course a foregone conclusion that the inter-governmental exchange
                        of views which the Foreign Office have in mind will result, so far as the
                        United Kingdom are concerned, in the inclusion in any line of tactics and in
                        any resolution which may be worked out, of some phraseology which will
                        endorse the majority views of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission.
                        The British Government are not in any sense weakening in their general
                        support of those views. But they are convinced that to attempt to force
                        those views through as an isolated issue will not only prove fruitless but
                        will also make it impossible to secure any objective consideration of the
                        far wider point mentioned in paragraph 6 above.</p>
                    <p>9. The Foreign Office accordingly wish to urge the State Department, in
                        consideration of the views outlined above, to refrain from pressing for the
                        time being their view about the isolated handling of the atomic energy issue
                        at the Assembly. They strongly hope that the State Department will agree as
                        a matter of urgency to send appropriate instructions in this sense to the
                        United States Delegation in New York and to such of their representatives
                        elsewhere as may be concerned. It is understood that a further informal
                        meeting in New York has been planned for the 4th August, and it is hoped
                        that an expression of the State Department’s views may be forthcoming before
                        that date.</p>

                        opposition on the part of these Delegations to the adoption of a resolution
                        of this kind. Both Delegations expressed the view that the <gloss

                        would be to have those members of the majority who agreed to state their

                        that he thought there would be no difficulty in accomplishing this. The
                        statements of the members to this effect would appear as a part of the

                                Delegation informed the Secretariat that it could not accept the

                                the USSR. The Soviet Union also noted that it had voted against the

                        proposed resolution by which the General Assembly would approve <pb n="380"
                            xml:id="pg_380" facs="0400"/>the specific proposal of the <gloss
                            target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> as a necessary basis for effective control.
                        Since the UK is ready to vote approval, we do not see why it is necessary
                        for them to withhold sponsorship which the French, Canadians, and Chinese
                        are ready to give. If they approve sponsorship they are still in a position
                        to continue the general discussion which they propose on the handling of the
                        whole matter. The important paragraphs of the proposed resolution on atomic
                        energy are those which have to do with approval of the First, Second and
                        Third Reports and not the final paragraph which is quoted on page 1,
                        paragraph 2 of the UK note and which is general in its nature and not
                        considered essential.</p>
                    <p>All the views on this matter are strongly supported by General McNaughton of
                        Canada who feels it extremely urgent that a full debate and vote be taken on
                        the atomic energy control plan of the Commission. The French and Chinese
                        Delegations have also informed <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> that
                        their Governments are prepared to support joint sponsorship of a resolution
                        approving the three <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> Reports.</p>

                    <p>The United States is entirely ready to withdraw the proposed draft resolution
                        mentioned in paragraph 3, page 1 of the British memorandum and simply vote

                    <p>Mr. Osborn said that he would inform us when he had heard further from Sir

                        held in Washington. Mr. Osborn said that in his opinion the other four

                        referred to simply because of the uncertainty of the UK as to its projected

                        Ignatieff and discussed a wide range of Assembly topics (see <pb n="381"
                            xml:id="pg_381" facs="0401"/>separate memorandum of conversation,

                        particularly long time, (on the General’s initiative), on the subject of
                        atomic energy, as follows.</p>
                    <p>General McNaugton referred to the recent British <hi rend="italic"
                            >aide-mémoire</hi>

                            Osborn on August 9, not printed.</note> (which we had not yet seen) and
                        went on to discuss two possible alternative courses open to us at the
                        General Assembly this Fall.</p>
                    <p>The first alternative is: To explain patiently what atomic energy is all
                        about, the principles and objectives to which fourteen of seventeen members
                        at various times of the Atomic Energy Commission are committed; to educate
                        the other members of the General Assembly and get them to understand these
                        principles and objectives and commit, themselves thereto; to leave the door
                        open to take advantage of any opportunity (which would be a fleeting one) of
                        getting the Russians to go along with the effective control of atomic
                        energy, implying the continued work of the Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
                    <p>The second alternative is to choose the occasion of the Assembly for a
                        pitched propaganda battle with the Russians, demonstrating that they have
                        ruined the chances of attaining any effective international control of
                        atomic energy and in effect suspend the work of the Atomic Energy
                        Commission.</p>
                    <p>General McNaughton clearly favored the first alternative although he
                        indicated that there might of course be factors of a broad political
                        character which would indicate that the second alternative would be
                        preferable. In any event, he thought it was essential to choose immediately
                        one or the other of these alternatives, prepare actively for the General
                        Assembly along the lines indicated, and stick to this line. The worst
                        solution would be to get the two alternatives mixed up. If there were ever a
                        time when clear cut decisions are needed, this is the time.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Jessup observed that negotiations now in progress in Moscow with regard
                        to Berlin and Germany might have a bearing on which course was chosen and it
                        therefore might not be possible to make an immediate decision. McNaughton
                        admitted this point and said he thought we should therefore develop two
                        clear cut alternative plans along lines indicated and decide upon one or the
                        other, if not immediately then at the earliest possible moment.</p>
                    <p>On the “propaganda approach” McNaugton felt that we could not possibly beat
                        the Russians at this game. Moreover, our objective should be to get as much
                        support as possible from the other members of the United Nations. If we
                        engage in a propaganda battle with the Russians many members of the General
                        Assembly, desiring to keep out of a <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0402"
                        />Russian-American fight, will take no part in the discussion and simply
                        abstain on any vote. The most important of the arguments against the
                        propaganda approach was, the General feared, that it would close the door on
                        any hope of eventual agreement with the Russians with regard to atomic
                        energy.</p>
                    <p>On the latter point, the General said that as an engineer and military man,
                        and one who had devoted much time to atomic energy over the past three
                        years, he was more than ever convinced of the formidable character of the
                        atomic bomb which had unleashed a new era of warfare. He did not at all
                        share the view of some that the significance of the atomic bomb had
                        originally been exaggerated. Because of his view, he thought it would be a
                        tragic error (I gathered leading inevitably to war) to close the door on any
                        possibility, however slight, of agreement with the Russians. If the door
                        were clearly left open, he did not anticipate any immediate change in the
                        Russian position merely because a majority of the Assembly had endorsed the
                        Atomic Energy Report. It might be five years or even ten before the Russians
                        would see the light, but we should at least keep on trying.</p>
                    <p>To simplify his view of the Russian position in the world with particular
                        reference to atomic energy, the General classified the possibilities in
                        three categories, namely: evolution, revolution and war. War of course is
                        what we are trying to avoid.</p>
                    <p>Under the heading of evolution, the General has in mind the wearing effect of
                        internal and external pressures leading to the gradual modification of
                        policy by an “imperialistic” power. Given enough time, perhaps five years,
                        perhaps ten, this evolutionary process might lead the Russians to come
                        around to our way of thinking with regard to atomic energy.</p>
                    <p>Under the head of revolution, it was not inconceivable that because of
                        internal dissensions not only within the Eastern European area but also
                        within the Soviet Union itself, the death of Stalin or some similar
                        incident, might lead to the coalescence of anti-Communist forces. The
                        Western Powers would presumably wish to help such a coalition and might well
                        lay down as a condition of such help, agreement on the effective
                        international control of atomic energy.</p>
                    <p>In any event, whether the processes were evolutionary or revolutionary, any
                        opportunity which we might have to achieve Russian agreement would be a very
                        fleeting one; we must therefore keep all doors open and be ever keenly alert
                        to take advantage of any such fleeting opportunity.</p>
                    <p>On the “educational” approach, McNaughton’s idea seems to be that without any
                        polemic we should clearly and patiently explain to the members of the
                        General Assembly exactly what is involved in the <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383"
                            facs="0403"/>effective international control of atomic energy as set
                        forth in the three reports by the Atomic Energy Commission. These reports
                        stand unassailable on their merits. The character and necessity of the
                        sacrifice of sovereignty required for the effective control of atomic energy
                        should be stressed in terms of a broad concept of international
                        organization. Our efforts should be two-fold: first, to educate the other
                        members of the United Nations and get the maximum number of them committed;
                        two, in effect to “plead” with the Russians to see that their ultimate
                        security rests on a collective effort based on their willingness to make the
                        necessary sacrifice of sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>On the specific question of what sort of action might be taken by the General
                        Assembly, McNaughton felt that there should be a resolution which would in
                        the first place endorse the three reports of the Atomic Energy Commission
                        and would in the second place request the Atomic Energy Commission to
                        continue its efforts in such ways as in its judgement it considered
                        feasible. It was not entirely clear to me whether McNaughton would also
                        favor as an additional point consultations among the Powers which sponsored
                        the original General Assembly Resolution on atomic energy.</p>
                    <p>The General thought that General Osborn’s views were close to his own. He
                        doubted whether the British had really thought the problem through or really
                        knew enough about it. He urged further United States, Canadian discussions
                        as a first step towards concerted policy at the Assembly on this
                        subject.</p>

                            <item>We agree with the United Kingdom view expressed in the memorandum
                                of August 2, 1948 that the fundamental issue underlying the impasse
                                on atomic energy is much broader than the atomic energy issue
                                itself; that in fact, it includes the whole attitude and actions of
                                the USSR toward the world community. This, indeed, is a fundamental
                                tenet of the Third Report. But it is not clear from the United
                                Kingdom memorandum whether the United Kingdom plans a frontal attack
                                on the USSR on this broad basis or whether it merely plans to merge
                                the issue of atomic energy in the discussion of Soviet obstructive
                                tactics with respect to voting.</item>

                            <item>To follow the tactic suggested by the United Kingdom of inviting a
                                wide-open debate on atomic energy rather than restricting the
                                discussion to the concrete record already developed is to play right
                                into the hands of the Soviet Union. Such a tactic will give the
                                Soviets an opportunity for a general discussion and debate of their
                                positions, in which kind of propaganda they can be more effective
                                than the rest of us. We feel that by holding them down to a debate
                                on the specific proposals submitted by the <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                                    >AEC</gloss> after two years of work they will be forced to
                                debate realities while at the same timé the great majority of the
                                other nations will vote approval rather than repudiate the findings
                                of their own Commission.</item>

                            <item>In view of the short time before the General Assembly in
                                September, it is extremely desirable to concert plans with friendly
                                Governments at once. The atomic energy issue is unique in its
                                complexity and it will take all the time we have to prepare
                                    non-<gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> members for an informed
                                debate. The quickest and surest means through which the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> majority can lay plans to
                                provide concerted leadership on the atomic energy issue in the
                                General Assembly is through a continuation of the informal
                                conversations in New York—tentative conclusions of which will, of
                                course, be subject to review by the Governments concerned. The
                                informal discussions in New York are simply a continuation of the
                                discussions which have been held by the permanent members
                                represented in the <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> majority
                                during the past two years and which have made our work in this field
                                possible and successful. The purpose of such meetings is not to bind
                                the five Governments to any particular plan of action but to keep
                                them mutually informed of proposed action as a basis for preserving
                                their solidarity. It should also be pointed out that these
                                conversations were not primarily initiated by the United States
                                Delegation any more than by any other Delegation.</item>

                            <item>The atomic energy record of the majority is their strongest point
                                in the security field. Failure to make it a major issue and to have
                                an informed debate on it would not only run the danger of losing the
                                results of two years of work on the part of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> but would quite possibly make
                                it impossible to obtain a General Assembly vote of approval on the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> plan, a plan which is
                                the only firm basis for a resumption of <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1"
                                    >UNAEC</gloss> activities. Such a tactic would also make it
                                possible for the Soviets to shift the blame for the present
                                difficulties in the <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> to other
                                Governments since atomic energy would be merged with other

                    <p>Cadogan handed me a written memorandum of what he had in mind to say, which
                        is as follows:</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>“As far as the United Kingdom Delegation can see, the differences between
                            the United States and United Kingdom positions on this matter are of
                            procedure rather than substance. In particular, the Foreign <pb n="386"
                                xml:id="pg_386" facs="0406"/>Office have made it clear that His
                            Majesty’s Government do not in any way depart from their support of the
                            majority proposals of the Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
                        <p>“The central idea of the Foreign Office as regards tactics in the
                            Assembly is that the behaviour of the Soviet Delegations in the Atomic
                            Energy Commission, the Commission for Conventional Armaments and the
                            Military Staff Committee respectively is symptomatic of a wider problem,
                            namely the abuse by the Soviet Union of its voting rights within the
                            United Nations. They are strongly of the opinion that unless and until
                            there is some sign of reform on the part of the Soviet Union, further
                            discussions in these bodies will in all probability be useless and may
                            foster dangerous illusions.</p>
                        <p>“The Foreign Office are consequently unwilling to commit themselves at
                            present to the idea of presenting in the Assembly a <hi rend="italic"
                                >separate</hi> resolution endorsing the substance of the latest
                            atomic energy proposals. They fear that this would, distract attention
                            from the real difficulty, namely the Soviet attitude referred to above,
                            and would obscure the fact that Soviet tactics have been equally
                            obstructive in the Commission for Conventional Armaments and the
                            Military Staff Committee.</p>
                        <p>“The Foreign Office are actively considering the best way of presenting
                            the case in the Assembly on the lines suggested above. They hope
                            therefore that the question of tactics may be left in suspense for a
                            week or two, by which time they hope to be able to exchange further
                            views with the State Department.”</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>Cadogan modified this statement somewhat verbally, but with no addition to
                        its content. I stated that with regard to general tactics dealing with the
                        Soviet in the General Assembly on all three matters, any expression of
                        opinion on my part was outside of my competence, but I would like him to
                        know that I thought the United Kingdom proposal laid all of us wide open to
                        a general debate in which all sorts of charges would be made, and in which
                        Soviet propaganda was likely to make as much impression as the statements of
                        other nations.</p>
                    <p>On the matter of atomic energy, it seemed inconceivable to me that the
                        General Assembly should not debate and then vote upon a resolution similar
                        in form to the resolution voted nine to two in the Security Council,
                        approving the pertinent parts of the three Reports of the Atomic Energy
                        Commission. Since such a debate and such a resolution appeared inevitable,
                        it seemed best to prepare for it now, regardless of what tactics we adopted
                        on larger issues. Certainly the strongest preparation would be for all those
                        nations which have taken part in an expression of majority views in the
                        Atomic Energy Commission during the past two years jointly to sponsor the

                    <p>Under the circumstances of our conversation, and unless I receive further
                        instructions from the State Department, it is my opinion that it would be
                        unwise for me to contact the other delegations in New <pb n="387"

                        up. I recognize that this means that the whole question of sponsoring the
                        resolution may have to await our arrival in Paris.</p>
                    <p>Immediately following on this conversation, I telephoned Mr. Falla and asked
                        him to inform Cadogan as follows:</p>

                        Confirming telephone conversation Johnson to Osborn therefore, Dept suggests

                            under reference, August 12, indicates that Johnson communicated to
                            Osborn the instructions contained in the present telegram. Osborn
                            expressed doubt as to the wisdom of contacting other delegations until
                            the British position was cleared up. (Department of State Disarmament
                            Files) However, in telegram 1029 from New York, August 18, Osborn
                            reported that all majority delegations except Syria had been consulted
                            regarding debate on atomic energy in the General Assembly and the
                            possibility of joint majority sponsorship of a resolution similar to
                            that which had been submitted by the United States in the Security

                            York, June 11, <ref target="#pg_347">p. 347</ref>). Osborn stated that
                            all consulted delegations “show real enthusiasm and should hear from

                                technical information with the Soviet Union on a reciprocal basis.
                                In brief the argumentation was along these lines: (See Tab A, Bohr’s

                                    <item>As to the security aspect of this proposal Dr. Bohr
                                        maintains that the security of the United States would be
                                        strengthened rather than weakened if the offer were carried
                                        through. Under present security phobias the United States is
                                        strangulating itself and is in danger of falling behind in
                                        many fields of science and technology. Moreover, giving the
                                        Soviet Union all information concerning atomic energy
                                        processes including the making of bombs (but not the bombs
                                        themselves) would probably so confuse and over-awe them that
                                        no net advantage would accrue to them. The United States on
                                        the other hand would gain much knowledge of the Soviet Union
                                        and would have breached the Iron Curtain which stands as the
                                        greatest threat to world peace and security.</item>

                                    <item>If it were to make this offer, Dr. Bohr emphasizes that
                                        the United States would have to be prepared to carry it
                                        through in all honesty. This requires the most meticulous
                                        study preparatory to any final decision on the idea.</item>

                                        and that the greatest popular fear which would have to be
                                        overcome concerns security, concludes that the one man who
                                        could carry conviction to the country on this matter is the
                                        present Secretary of State. This is so not only because of

                                was done in a letter of June 10, 1948. (See Tab B.) The Secretary
                                asked Mr. Baruch for his views which were received on June 2. Mr.
                                Baruch commented that “a great issue was raised, suited to invoke
                                the highest aspirations of mankind” when the United States made its
                                atomic energy proposals of June 14, 1946. (See Tab D.)</item>

                            <item>On June 14, 1946, the U.S. made a sweeping offer of “openness”,
                                supported by adequate safeguards in the field of atomic energy. As
                                elaborated over the past two years by the <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1"
                                    >UNAEC</gloss>, the plan for atomic energy control would produce
                                in this one field, and as a prototype for other fields, an
                                atmosphere of complete openness. The majority has committed itself
                                in the Second Report of the <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss>
                                to a policy of no secrecy in this field, once a fully effective
                                system of control is established. The majority proposals place great
                                stress on adequate safeguards. Although the issue of “no veto”
                                received undue attention in the public press during the negotiations
                                and blurred the focus, the elements of safeguards required are
                                essential to the plan and would be equally required in the Bohr
                                proposal.</item>

                                dated May 17, 1948, has come to the conclusion, after more than two
                                years of intensive study, that the continued intransigence of the
                                Soviet Union and its satellites and their unwillingness to
                                participate in a cooperative world community, arises from a
                                situation beyond the competence of the Atomic Energy Commission.
                                Therefore the majority recommended that until such time as the
                                Soviet Union showed its willingness to participate in the world
                                community to the extent required by the majority proposals,
                                negotiations in <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> should be

                            <item>As far as the diagnosis of the disease is concerned the majority
                                of <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> and Dr. Bohr are in
                                agreement: The stumbling block is the attitude of the Soviet Union.
                                The difference lies in that Bohr proposes that we try again on a
                                much broader and more nebulous base. The majority considers that
                                those elements of cooperation essential not only to atomic energy
                                control but also to eventual control of other weapons of mass
                                destruction have been firmly established, and that it remains for
                                the Soviet Union to agree and that, in the absence of such
                                agreement, the peoples of the world should understand the nature of

                            <item>The Bohr proposal is admittedly made only in general terms. Bohr
                                feels that the details, while exceedingly important, are beyond his
                                competence and must be considered by those more familiar with the
                                political and military aspects involved. No one can quarrel with
                                what might ideally be achieved under his proposed offer. One must
                                raise sharply, however, queries concerning methods and tactics of
                                implementation. These queries can be answered only by most
                                thorough-going study, which would require imaginative people from
                                many areas of Government, notably the Department of State, the
                                National Defense Establishment and the Atomic Energy Commission.
                                What the net conclusions of such a study would be, no one can say at
                                this time.</item>

                            <item>The crucial ingredient in any complete examination of the proposal
                                is knowledge. This can come only from people in the various agencies
                                who would have full access to their particular phases of
                                information. This involves key people who could not take part in
                                such a study without making its existence known. It appears likely
                                that knowledge of the existence of such a project if initiated now
                                would be used in the election campaign with resulting jeopardy to
                                the study itself.</item>

                            <item>On so important a matter as this, it is evident that it could
                                succeed only if—after having been determined to be feasible in a
                                technical sense—it secured not only the support of key figures in
                                both political parties but the overwhelming understanding support of
                                the U.S. public. While the bi-partisan approach in foreign affairs
                                has been eminently successful during the war and since, and might in
                                fact prove possible on this matter, the current build up of the
                                election campaign makes a coordination of viewpoint on this proposal
                                exceedingly complicated. At minimum, the Administration would need
                                the support of <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0414"/>Governor

                                Hickenlooper. It may well be that these gentlemen would not wish to
                                indicate any reaction to the idea in its present general terms in
                                the absence of a thorough study and in the expectation of a
                                Republican victory at the polls this fall. It is reasonable to
                                assume that they would prefer, if any study is to be undertaken,
                                that it be done under a new Administration.</item>

                            <item>Apart from the specific technical aspects of the problem there are
                                certain points that can now be made in advance of a full examination
                                of all phases. These deal primarily with probable Soviet reactions.
                                Dr. Bohr has stated that the United States would stand to gain
                                whether the Soviet Union said “yes” or “no.” It seems evident that
                                real moral and psychological advantage would accrue to the United
                                States should the Soviet Union give a flat “no.” It may be presumed,
                                subject to further study, that the United States would stand to gain
                                if the Soviet Union accepted the offer. There is, however, a
                                twilight zone which appears to be the most likely contingency. It is
                                very much to be doubted that the Soviet Union would give either a
                                flat “yes” or “no” answer. In all probability the Soviet Union would
                                do something in between giving only the appearance of acceptance,
                                coupled with counter proposals and demands, similar to, if not
                                identical with, their actions in the <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1"
                                    >UNAEC</gloss> negotiations. The Soviet Union would probably
                                mount a terrific counter-attack along the following lines: <quote

                                        evidence of this is their proposal for “openness”. Such a
                                        proposal is a crude attempt to interfere in the internal
                                        affairs of states. It is a gross assault on national
                                        sovereignty of nations. It is an attempt to obtain
                                        intelligence the United States has been unable to obtain by
                                        other means. One need only observe that while the United
                                        States is making what it calls a sweeping proposal of
                                        openness it continues to manufacture, stockpile, and
                                        intimidate the world with, the atomic bomb. If the United
                                        States is serious in its protestations for a peaceful world
                                        why then do they not give up the weapon, outlaw its use, and
                                        destroy the present stockpiles?</p>

                                history of the atomic energy negotiations in the United Nations. As
                                Mr. Baruch rightly points out in his letter to the Secretary, the
                                original United States proposals for atomic energy control
                                constituted “a great issue suited to invoke the highest aspirations
                                of mankind.” It did indeed lift the hopes of men when it was made.
                                There is perhaps in history no greater offer and it was generally
                                recognized as such by all thinking people. But what happened? It is
                                significant to note that the Soviet Union has never claimed that the
                                proposals evolved from the United States offer, namely, the present
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> majority proposals, were
                                unsuited to the task of controlling atomic energy for peaceful
                                purposes only. The Soviet Union has never laid stress on the merits
                                of the proposals themselves but have sought—and to a degree
                                succeeded—in confusing the issue by appeals to national sovereignty,
                                independence of states, charges of imperialism and monopoly against
                                the United States, and demands that atomic bombs be outlawed and
                                destroyed. As a result the challenge of the great issue has become
                                so blurred that the man on the street doubts whether the offer ever
                                should have been made and many do not realize that the United States
                                has offered to give up its atomic bombs when an adequate control
                                system is in effect.</item>

                            <item>Mr. Baruch in his reply to the Secretary of June 2 (Tab D) points
                                out that Dr. Bohr had stated “a number of truisms, but he does not
                                say how we can arrive at them.” Bohr’s proposal lacks any spelling
                                out of stages although he does suggest the following general
                                approach: a preliminary conference to determine whether the
                                proposition were acceptable “in principle”. [Here one must point out
                                that the Soviet Union has already accepted many propositions “in
                                principle”, including “strict international control of atomic
                                    energy”.]<note n="13" xml:id="d222fn13">Brackets appear in the
                                    source text.</note> This conference would be followed by a
                                balancing out of information and access that nations would be
                                willing to provide. Once a rough balance had been struck and found
                                to be mutually advantageous to all, a regime of openness would be
                                implemented immediately. In commenting upon time scale and the
                                problem of stages in connection with the <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1"
                                    >UNAEC</gloss> plan of atomic energy control, Dr. Bohr considers
                                that failure to achieve agreement on that plan demonstrates the
                                necessity of “a line of policy, directly aimed at mutual openness on
                                a still broader and <hi rend="underline">more immediate basis</hi>
                                than contemplated in the, American proposal” (Tab B. <pb n="396"

                                he stated in his brief “Annotations” of June 19, that: “Altogether,
                                the eventual acceptance of an offer of full mutual openness and the
                                actual admittance of observers may, in fact, be said to be an
                                irreversible step.” (Tab C).</item>

                            <item>The issue of stages is a crucial one. It cannot be assumed that
                                any country would be prepared to enter into a regime of openness at
                                one leap. In working out what would appear to most reasonable men to
                                be a fair and just sequence, one can be sure that the Soviet Union
                                would find much material for propaganda charges. They could haggle,
                                delay, and accuse <hi rend="italic">ad infinitum, ad nauseam</hi>,
                                in the working out and the implementation of stages. This might
                                indeed be the method they would employ in sabotaging the whole offer
                                even if they agreed initially to the general idea, in
                                principle.</item>

                            <item>The Bohr proposal strikes at the heart of the difficulty between
                                the East and the West only in a limited sense. The Iron Curtain is a
                                major symptom of the disease that infects the Soviet Union. That
                                disease would appear to be primarily mental. The Soviet state is
                                characterized by a fanatical materialist ideology. It has
                                effectively harnessed Czarist Russian imperialism, traditional
                                Russian xenophobia, modern propaganda techniques, Marxian ideology,
                                and a police state so that its ability to impose its will on its own
                                people and those of other nations is tremendous.</item>

                            <item>All nations are guilty of a certain egocentrism. This is an easily
                                understood psychological and sociological phenomenon. Among nations,
                                however, with certain common traditions, culture patterns,
                                institutions, and ways of thought, this egocentrism need not give
                                rise to basic misunderstandings and conflict. Western nations may
                                quarrel with their friends but, in most instances at least, they
                                have a sufficient working knowledge of what their friends’ thought
                                processes, ambitions and needs are to give effective accommodation
                                to them. The Soviet Union, however, is not in this community of
                                nations. It has deliberately turned its back to it and suppressed
                                those elements and forces that would tend to foster Soviet
                                participation in the world community. It emphasizes its different
                                history and its long-standing isolation. Words, morals, and a code
                                of ethics do not mean the same to them as to us. Actions have
                                different meanings. Aspirations are of a different character. It is
                                as though the Western world considers that two and two make four,
                                while the Soviet Union considers that these two numbers add up to
                                different totals at different times. And this is <pb n="397"
                                    xml:id="pg_397" facs="0417"/>more than mere analogy. Soviet
                                philosophy in the fundamental sense rejects the Aristotelian
                                concepts of form and discreteness and is based on theories of
                                interaction and merging of identities along the lines of Bergsonian
                                creative evolution. One may indeed say that when the basic tools of
                                thought are different one can conclude that there can be no real
                                meeting of minds.</item>

                            <item>Complete openness would not in itself change this hard core of
                                difference. It would have, to be sure, positive effects. If the West
                                were able to make its thought and action known directly to the
                                people of the Soviet Union, the comparisons that the Soviet people
                                might make would not be invidious to the West. A long period of full
                                intercourse might bring about gradual changes in the basic premises
                                of the philosophy of the Soviet State and its tenets of faith. Most
                                important, it would be in the long run permit the masses of the
                                people to exert their influence on large issues. Openness would also
                                wipe out many of the physical paraphernalia of the police state and
                                lay it open to the fresh breezes of common sense and appreciation of
                                the nature of the rest of the world.</item>

                            <item>But because the police state paraphernalia is not the core of the
                                Soviet State itself but a manifestation of its different orientation
                                of thinking which is as real to the Soviet mind as Western thought
                                patterns are to Western peoples, it is inconceivable that the
                                Politburo could be induced to accept the offer in good faith. They
                                could not do so and continue to exist as they are. As has been
                                indicated above, such an offer would in all probability give rise to
                                a furious attack on the motives and objectives of those making

                                take in the next General Assembly. Thus far the plurality, if not
                                the majority, opinion is that the Soviet Union will launch a peace
                                offensive. This might take many forms. The Soviet Union may offer
                                crumbs of concessions in Germany, in Korea; it may blandly suggest
                                that certain commercial air rights be granted in the Soviet Union,
                                that some increase in travel be permitted, that more consulates be
                                established. To accept such offers as moves toward openness would be
                                dangerous, for they would in all probability not indicate a change

                                problems. Throughout its history the United Nations has been faced
                                with “the everlasting no” of the Soviet Union. The most vital
                                example in this connection is the majority control plan for atomic
                                energy. If the Soviet Union intends to show a face of sweetness and
                                light in the next General Assembly, it should be asked politely but
                                firmly if this means it is ready to agree to the majority plan of
                                control. If its answer is “yes,” there is ground for restrained
                                optimism. If its answer is “no,” the peace offensive can be shown to
                                be lacking in substance.</item>

                                endeavor it has been joined by a preponderant majority of the
                                nations concerned. While not making an offer of openness along the
                                lines of the Bohr proposal, the United States can properly cite the
                                record over the past several years which demonstrates its efforts to
                                foster the development of the peaceful, cooperative world in which
                                we want to live. This is a world in which politically independent
                                states can work together to reach common solutions to common
                                problems. This is a world in which views can be freely exchanged and
                                information required for the solution of problems is made freely
                                available (it was the United States which gave to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> a large bulk of technical and
                                scientific information—properly declassified—which was required for
                                a proper understanding of the nature of the problem of atomic energy
                                control and the soundness of the United States proposals). This is a
                                world where decisions can be made on the basis of the combined
                                thinking of the nations concerned.</item>

                                appropriate that the blame for the impasse on many issues be placed

                                foregoing would meet frontally any Soviet peace offensive. It would
                                be possible with this approach to ask the Soviet Union again and
                                again precisely what it means, to point out that words are of little
                                consequence unless they are substantiated by deeds, and that the way
                                to demonstrate good faith in the interests of peace is to cooperate
                                not only in the solution of common problems but also in the
                                implementation of the decisions reached. The bellwether of this
                                approach can very well be atomic energy control, for it is in this
                                field that the record of the United States is clearest, the issues
                                are sharpest, and the intransigence of the Soviet Union is most
                                evident.</item>

                            <item>Whatever may be the ultimate decision on the Bohr proposal, a
                                General Assembly theme along the lines of the above would in no way
                                jeopardize either rejecting the Bohr proposals or accepting them in
                                full at a later date after they have been given the closest study.
                                Indeed Dr. Bohr himself in the closing paragraphs of his letter to
                                the Secretary (Tab B) has the following to say on this point. <quote
                                    rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“If the international and domestic situation favored it, the
                                        most direct step would be a concrete proposal of universal
                                        openness, aimed at prompt realization. Yet, if such a
                                        procedure would not be deemed timely, it might be found
                                        suitable, after proper preparations, to use an early
                                        occasion, when re-stating the general lines of American
                                        policy, to stress the urgency of fullest mutual openness and
                                        express readiness to entertain proposals to this effect.</p>
                                    <p>“Even the preliminary approach, consisting of a declaration
                                        of aspiration and intent, might perhaps elicit an answer
                                        which could serve as a further stepping stone. But
                                        irrespective of such response, this initiative should
                                        contribute decisively to clarify the situation; it would
                                        greatly strengthen the moral position of all advocates of
                                        genuine international cooperation and bring adversaries
                                        everywhere in rapidly increasing difficulties.”</p>

                        <p>We recognise and share the desire of the State Department to secure the
                            widest possible measure of acceptance in the General Assembly of the
                            majority decisions of the Atomic Energy Commission. Suppose, for the
                            moment, that we adopt the United States plan of procedure which, as we
                            understand it, is to concentrate entirely on this issue, and to procure
                            a two-thirds majority in the Assembly for a resolution (dealing solely
                            with the item on the Provisional Agenda comprising the Security
                            Council’s special report) endorsing the majority decisions of the Atomic
                            Energy Commission. We understand that in order to concentrate on this
                            aim (and for other reasons which include apparently some apprehension
                            about the record of the majority in the Disarmament Commission) the
                            State Department want to keep any discussion of disarmament in the
                            Assembly to the minimum if it cannot be altogether excluded.</p>
                        <p>2. We agree that it is likely (perhaps it should not be put higher) that
                            a two-thirds majority could be secured for such a resolution. We should
                            expect that it would provoke a heated debate, in the course of which the
                            Russians would argue along the following lines. Why, they would ask, was
                            this attempt being made to railroad through a majority decision on this
                            specific and isolated issue? This contrasted oddly with the marked lack
                            of enthusiasm for any discussion of disarmament in the Assembly. Is not
                            the reason that the Americans are anxious to get their own views
                            adopted, wind up the Atomic Energy Commission on the pretext that no
                            progress is possible, and thereby hang on to their own advantage in the
                            field of atomic energy? While, as regards disarmament, the Americans
                            have not felt any need to press for a decision one way or the other
                            because they are not interested in what happens in this field so long as
                            they retain the monopoly of the atomic bomb.</p>
                        <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0421"/>
                        <p>3. We think that this would be an embarrassing situation to Have to face
                            and that it is the Americans who will be presenting the Russians with
                            the opening for it. We do not of course suggest that such charges could
                            not be answered. But it is true that the Americans have shown no great
                            interest in the Disarmament Commission (what running there has been in
                            that body has been primarily made by ourselves) and we think that the
                            impression created on public opinion generally might well be to credit
                            the argument in the last sentence of paragraph 2 above.</p>
                        <p>4. Whilst, therefore, we should have secured the wide backing which the
                            Americans (and we ourselves) desire for a concrete plan for atomic
                            energy development and control, the objective would be a relatively
                            limited one: it would be secured in the face of damaging attacks in
                            other directions: and what is, in our view, the root of the matter would
                            have only been partially tackled.</p>
                        <p>5. This root point is, as we see it, that progress in the United Nations
                            is not possible unless a real attempt is made to regard majority views
                            (especially when the majority is overwhelming) as something to which
                            individual views (unless it is a question of life and death or of one
                            party being put in a demonstrably unequal position) should in general
                            defer.</p>
                        <p>6. No such attempt is made at present. In the Security Council this
                            results in the abuse of the right of veto. In the atomic energy,
                            disarmament and Article 43 fields, the veto lies in the background, but
                            as the ultimate sanction of the recalcitrant minority, not as the
                            immediate issue which confronts us.</p>
                        <p>7. The immediate issue in all the three fields concerned (and hence our
                            reason for bracketing them) is that there is a strong or overwhelming
                            majority view on basic principles which the minority refuses to accept.
                            The atomic energy position is admittedly the most serious because of the
                            far more advanced work done on it, which could speedily be made a
                            reality if there were general agreement. But in all three fields there
                            is a clear split on basic points. It is this common aspect of the
                            position which so perturbs us. The matters concerned are of fundamental
                            and vital importance to all Governments, and if the minority choose to
                            stand on their rights, they are entitled to do so. But how then can any
                            progress be made? It should be clear from the work of all three bodies
                            (and we can stress again the real magnanimity of the offer embodied in
                            the Baruch Plan) that no attempt is being made by the majority to put
                            any country in an inferior position vis-à-vis the rest in these
                            matters.</p>
                        <p>8. If we take this general line we foresee the following advantage over
                            the American line of tactics.</p>
                        <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0422"/>
                        <p>9. First, by taking the initiative ourselves on these general lines, we
                            should forestall any attempt by the Russians to claim that no real
                            attempt has been made to carry out the recommendations of the Assembly
                            Resolution of December 14th, 1946. Quite conceivably this may be a major
                            Russian intention as regards the work of the forthcoming Session.</p>
                        <p>10. Second, we should cover ourselves at our (or, rather, the Americans’)
                            weak pointy namely that there has been great vigour displayed over the
                            work of the Atomic Energy Commission, but very little over the work in
                            the other two fields. At least, in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of them
                            basic principles have been agreed by a majority and rejected by a
                            minority.</p>
                        <p>11. Third, we should in the course of our argument (and in the drawing of
                            any resolution) be able to request the Assembly specifically to endorse
                            the majority decisions of the Atomic Energy Commission and of the
                            Disarmament Commission (assuming the latter to be brought to the
                            attention of the Assembly) and thus to cover the main American
                            preoccupation.</p>
                        <p>12. Fourth, we should be able to try to conduct the discussions on an
                            objective basis (as an “all party” investigation into where the United
                            Nations has failed so far) and in this broader setting to avoid as far
                            as possible individual recriminations against the Russians which will
                            get us nowhere. The “wide open debate” would not be upon atomic energy,
                            but on fundamental problems of the United Nations: but in the course of
                            its development there would be a discussion of the “concrete record” of
                            the majority decisions of the Atomic Energy Commission as an <hi
                                rend="italic">illustration</hi> (to be followed by others) of the
                            situation described in paragraphs 6 and 7 above, not as the sole, even
                            if the most striking, example.</p>
                        <p>13. Fifth, we should try (and the procedural difficulties do not seem
                            insurmountable) to streamline the course of debate in Committee I so as
                            to have (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) a debate on the veto (as it emerges
                            from the report of the Interim Committee) and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                            a debate on the triple field of atomic energy, disarmament and Article
                            43 security (linked together by the Resolution of December 14th 1946)
                            rather than (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) one on the veto, (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) one on atomic energy, (<hi rend="italic"
                                >c</hi>) one on disarmament (whether proposed by the Russians or
                            arising from a special report by the Security Council) and perhaps (<hi
                                rend="italic">d</hi>) one on Article 43. All this might well save as
                            regards time and repetition of acrimonies with the Russians, without
                            sacrificing any major point of principle.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Mr. Jebb presented the United Kingdom views tentatively outlined in Tab
                            A.<note n="2" xml:id="d224fn2">Not printed.</note> He stated that the
                        United Kingdom position had apparently been misunderstood during the past
                        two or three weeks and that they had no idea whatever in Weakening in their
                        support of the report of the Atomic Energy Commission. According to Jebb,
                        the United Kingdom is 100% for the Atomic Energy Commision reports <hi
                            rend="italic">with publicity</hi>. Their principal interest was to
                        demonstrate that in the fields of atomic energy, disarmament, the Military
                        Staff Committee and the veto, that the attitude of the minority was blocking
                        effective United Nations action, and that this constitued one of the most
                        serious and fundamental problems confronting the United Nations. He made it
                        clear that he was thinking of a suspension of the work of the Commission for
                        Conventional Armaments and the Military Statff Committee on much the same
                        grounds as the work of the Atomic Energy Commission. He envisaged an omnibus
                        resolution covering all three points.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Pearson and Mr. Rusk repeated the known Canadian and United States views,
                        expressing concern that there be no attempt to play down the atomic energy
                            situation.<note n="3" xml:id="d224fn3">Pearson and Rusk had discussed
                            this question <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> at Washington on August
                            20. The memorandum of that conversation indicates that Pearson made it
                            clear that the Canadian Government favored the United States position
                            stressing atomic energy control and opposed the British plan of
                            combining atomic energy with the disarmament and Article 43 questions.
                            (Department of State Disarmament Files)</note> In order not to confuse
                        the three questions, which presented quite different problems, the
                        possibility of breaking an omnibus resolution up into three general sections
                            <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0424"/>was discussed, along with the
                        possibility of three quite separate resolutions.</p>
                    <p>All present agreed that a minimum requirement would be to educate the Members
                        of the Assembly on the issues raised by atomic energy control and to ensure
                        that all delegations understood the meaning of the three reports. Mr. Rusk
                        suggested that if it were desirable to extend the atomic energy debate into
                        regulation of armaments and Military Staff Committee matters for the purpose
                        of demonstrating the recalcitrant conduct of the minority, it might be well
                        to go one step further and point to the conduct of the minority in blocking
                        a political settlement across a broad front. He stated that it would be
                        possible to take the initiative and force the USSR to accept the
                        responsibility for the absence of political confidence which is prerequisite
                        to progress in the field of the regulation of armaments.</p>
                    <p>There was general agreement that the three subjects could be kept separate in
                        debate (for instance, a debate in three distinct parts), and possibly linked
                        at the end of the three-phase debate in a single resolution. Pearson and
                        ourselves pointed out certain procedural difficulties in such a plan. With
                        respect to the wording of the draft British resolution, Jebb admitted that
                        the British would be willing to insert stronger language than “taking note”
                        of the atomic energy reports. There seemed to be a tendency toward a
                        consensus that, if there should be an omnibus resolution, rather than
                        providing for suspension on conventional armaments and on the Military Staff
                        Committee, such a resolution could regret the lack of progress in these
                        fields and list the reasons preventing such progress.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that it would be important for Mr. Jebb, General McNaughton and
                        Mr. Osborn to discuss this subject further in. Washington during the present
                        week (this meeting has been set for Friday morning, September 3).</p>

                                implied that the United Nations had no objection to the stationing

                    <p>The General Assembly of the United Nations on December 14, 1946 passed by
                        acclamation a resolution on the Principles Governing the General Regulation
                        and Reduction of Armaments (A/267) which contained the paragraph quoted
                        above in the statement of the problem.</p>
                    <p>The inclusion of that paragraph in the resolution was the outgrowth of an
                        Egyptian proposal to add a somewhat similar provision to a resolution
                        calling for certain information about the armed forces of Member States on
                        foreign territory which the Soviet Government introduced first in the
                        Security Council later in the General Assembly in the hope that it would
                        prove embarrassing to the governments of the United States and the United
                        Kingdom. The Soviet proposal was introduced in the Security Council, on
                        August 29, 1946 (S/144) but after debate a majority of the members of that
                        body voted not to place the matter on the Council’s agenda. The Soviet
                        Government then introduced a similar resolution in the General Assembly, but
                        that body adopted in place of it the part of the reduction of armaments
                        resolution quoted above and a resolution (A/269) calling upon the Security
                        Council to determine, as soon as possible, the information which United
                        Nations Members should be called upon to furnish in order to give effect to
                        the regulation of armaments resolution.</p>
                    <p>It will be noted that the General assembly, by its adoption of the resolution
                        paragraph quoted above, gave its sanction to the stationing of armed forces
                        of one United Nations Member in the territories of other United Nations
                        Members in the circumstances stated.</p>

                        (other than members of Military, Naval, or Air Attachés’ offices) are not
                        covered by a published agreement, arrangements should be made for the
                        negotiation of an exchange of notes between the United States and the other

                        of satisfying in some other manner the requirements of the resolution.</p>
                    <p>Any treaty, agreement, exchange of notes, or the like, which is available to
                        the public in printed form (that is true of every instrument designated by a

                        General Assembly Resolution of December 14, 1946, on the registration and
                        publication of agreements), is considered to have been made public.</p>
                    <p>There now remain only a few cases in which the presence of personnel of the
                        U.S. Armed Forces on the territory of another United Nations Member is not
                        covered by the Member’s consent expressed in a manner which meets the
                        requirements of the paragraph of the General Assembly Resolution of December
                        14, 1946, quoted in the statement of the problem, No attempt is being made
                        to obtain agreements covering very small contingents of such personnel on
                        missions of an obviously temporary nature, such, for example, as grave
                        registration units, and groups which are conducting negotiations. The
                        Department is of the opinion that the resolution was not directed at
                        situations of that sort. The U.S. Delegation to the General Assembly will be
                        furnished with a summary of the latest available information regarding
                        personnel of the U.S. Armed Forces on the territory of other United Nations
                        Members and the status of covering agreement or negotiations.</p>

                        Jebb agreed to recommend four separate resolutions instead of one omnibus
                        resolution. The strategy in question would generally be as follows:</p>

                        remain clear-cut. These resolutions would be as follows: <list>

                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. This Resolution would refer
                                particularly to what the British call the “root point” or “problem”,
                                namely, the unwillingness of the Soviets to abide by majority
                                decisions in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> organs and in general
                                their completely obstructive tactics which prevent constructive

                    </p>
                    <p>Having four separate resolutions would mean advance planning and lobbying to
                        control the situation in the manner outlined above. (Provisions for securing
                        joint-sponsorship of each are discussed below, pp. 6 and 7.)</p>
                    <p>With the exception of the atomic energy resolution, the substance of the four
                        resolutions was not discussed in any detail but discussion revolved around
                        the general idea of separate resolutions.</p>
                    <p>There was general agreement that the “majority” sponsors of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> should meet in Paris upon arrival to
                        develop the best method of handling the problem of educating the other
                        delegations. It was agreed that there should be a division of labor for this
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>Respecting a possible proposal’s being made in the <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                            >GA</gloss> to go on in <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> with a
                        discussion of other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction, there was
                        general agreement that “we need not fear any such tactics since we have
                        already answered such proposals several times on previous occasions. Our
                        answers have generally been along the lines that since a strong and
                        effective safeguards system has already been developed in the field of
                        atomic energy, which is by all odds the most important field over which
                        control must be established, the first task is to get acceptance of this
                        control system. Once it has been accepted the international atmosphere will
                        be so changed that all manner of things may then be possible, including
                        measures of control in the field of other mass weapons. At this time,
                        however, it is clear that the same obstacles to establishing effective
                        control will be manifest in the field of other mass weapons as have been
                        experienced in the field of atomic energy.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Rusk</hi> started off the meeting by stating that
                        he thought it would be most fruitful perhaps if Mr. Osborn would outline the
                        position which the United States believed the majority should take in the
                            <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and if Mr. Jebb would follow with a
                        presentation of the British point of view. Mr. Rusk stated that this was
                        only a suggestion, however, and that he would like others to make any
                        suggestions they wished.</p>
                    <p>There was general agreement to this mode of proceeding except that General
                        McNaughton said he desired to make a preliminary statement.</p>
                    <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0430"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">General McNaughton’s</hi> preliminary statement was a
                        very forceful presentation of the view that there was one thing of supreme
                        and transcendent importance in the security field and that was that the
                        atomic energy issue should be debated with as little confusion with other
                        issues as possible and should be followed, above all, by a resolution of
                        approval by the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> of the <gloss
                            target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> control plan. General McNaughton stated
                        that if these things were accomplished he personally did not feel it was of
                        too great moment what else was done in the security field.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Osborn</hi> then reviewed the position in which the
                        majority of the <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> delegates found
                        themselves at the seat of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> at the
                        present moment. Going back into the history of <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1"
                            >UNAEC</gloss> developments he pointed to the fact that the Second
                        Report was a majority report and was the product of the joint labors of all
                        the majority members who had worked so competently for a period of many
                        months on its development. Mr. Osborn stated after the <gloss
                            target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> reconvened in January, 1948, there was
                        a question as to what it should undertake in the immediate future. While
                        initially there was some thought of proceeding with the matter of
                        organization, it was soon felt by the members of the majority that the
                        Commission had gone as far as it could without getting into those problems
                        which were primarily political in nature and which could be settled only in
                        terms of the conditions existing at the time an agreement would be signed.
                        This point of view was crystalized by M. de Rose of the French Delegation
                        who drafted the essential content of the Third Report on his own initiative.
                        M. <hi rend="smallcaps">de Rose</hi> went so far as to recommend a <hi
                            rend="italic">final</hi> winding up of the activities of the Commission
                        as being a complete failure. It was particularly significant that M. de Rose
                        should take such an attitude since the French had started out with the idea
                        of mediating between the United States and the U.S.S.R. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                            >Mr. Osborn</hi> noted that the French particularly resented the idea of
                        calling the Third Report a United States Report.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Osborn</hi> added that the informal conversations
                        which had been held for the preparation of the Second and Third Reports had
                        been conducted on a personal basis and that the conclusions arrived at had
                        ultimately been submitted to the five governments in question for official
                        confirmation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Osborn</hi> noted that this pattern of procedure
                        had been going successfully and conclusions were being reached and agreed
                        upon in plenty of time to permit adequate preparation for the <gloss
                            target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> when the UK <gloss target="#t_FonOff1"
                            >FonOff</gloss> suddenly asked that the conversations be halted until
                        further conversations were held between the UK and the US as to <gloss
                            target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> strategy. Mr. Osborn, supported by General
                        McNaughton, emphasized the fact that six weeks had been lost as a result of
                        this action of the <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0431"/>UK <gloss
                            target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss>, and he added that the other nine
                        delegates had agreed on a joint resolution.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Jebb</hi> replied to Mr. Osborn by stating in the
                        first place that there had been considerable misunderstanding in regard to
                        this whole matter. He had been away when the question of stopping the
                        informal conversations had arisen. Without going into further explanations
                        and excuses he stated that what the <gloss target="#t_FonOff1"
                            >FonOff</gloss> wanted to do was to look at the matter as a whole,
                        though it did not wish to minimize atomic energy. By looking at the matter
                        as a Whole the <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> wished to call
                        attention to the thread which rah through all angles of the security problem
                        and other UK problems, namely, the damaging nature of the Soviet obstructive
                        tactics to the progress of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> generally
                        in their being unwilling to abide even by overwhelming majority votes in
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> organs.</p>
                    <p>However, <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Jebb</hi> stated that with further thought
                        on the matter the <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> had decided to
                        withdraw its proposal for one omnibus resolution since he could see that
                        there was danger of confusing the atomic energy discussions by combining it
                        With a discussion of more general matted and the <gloss target="#t_FonOff1"
                            >FonOff</gloss> would be satisfied with a separate resolution covering
                        the “root problem.”</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Jebb</hi> did say, however, that whereas the United
                        States apparently wished to give the impression that activities in the

                            >MSC</gloss> would be continued, his government felt that this would be
                        deluding the public and thought that both bodies should be adjourned.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Jebb</hi> concluded his initial remarks by saying
                        that it was the original intention of the <gloss target="#t_FonOff1"
                            >FonOff</gloss> to have one omnibus resolution, divided into parts I,
                        II, III, and IV, but that as long as IV was adequately taken care of he
                        believed that his government would be prepared to accept separate
                        resolutions on I, II and III.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">General McNaughton</hi> then took up the question of
                        the possible adjournment of the <gloss target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss> and the
                            <gloss target="#t_MSC1">MSC</gloss> to which Mr. Jebb had referred. He
                        pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss> and <gloss
                            target="#t_MSC1">MSC</gloss> activities were on an entirely different
                        basis from those of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>. The former were
                        still dealing with the initial phase of the problem whereas the latter had
                        completed the essentials of a control plan. General McNaughton felt that
                        until “we have been through the drill” in the <gloss target="#t_CCA1"
                            >CCA</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_MSC1">MSC</gloss> we have no
                        right to say that they cannot be carried further, nor would the members of
                        the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> be adequately prepared for supporting
                        an adjournment resolution in each case.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">General McNaughton</hi> again emphasized the fact that
                        whatever else happened we must get the approval of the majority <gloss
                            target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> plan of control because of the moral
                        victory it would represent and because with such approval we would be well
                        armed to take advantage of a <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0432"/>first
                        rift in the Iron Curtain which made it appear as though progress would be
                        possible in this field.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Rusk</hi> stated that apparently we were now all
                        agreed on a debate in separate stages followed by separate resolutions. He
                        added, however, that he did not believe we would want the atomic energy
                        issue or the other issues immediately referred to a sub-committee. He
                        thought we would want a general debate in Committee I which would be
                        sufficient to educate the general public as to the issues involved.
                        Following this general debate we could then table our joint resolution and
                        have it referred to a sub-committee along with other resolutions and
                        amendments. Meanwhile the general debate would continue in Committee I.</p>
                    <p>At this point there was a brief exchange between Mr. Raynor and Mr. Jebb
                        respecting the nature of Resolution IV. Both expressed the view that this
                        Resolution could perhaps include references to the veto question and then be
                        generalized to deal with the whole political question. General McNaughton
                        approved such a Resolution.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Osborn</hi> then returned to the question of the
                        handling of <gloss target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss> matters. He pointed out that
                        the Soviets fear of an effective safeguard system in the field of
                        conventional armaments was as real as in respect to such safeguards in the
                        atomic energy field. Therefore, he suggested that it would be a good idea to
                        spend time in the <gloss target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss> following the <gloss
                            target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> in elaborating that section of the Resolution
                        on Item II which briefly dealt with safeguards. Having done so the work of
                        the <gloss target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss> would then be somewhat comparable to
                        the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> in terms of completeness, the Soviet
                        attitude would be made clear to the public, and the majority of the <gloss
                            target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss> could then go to the 1949 <gloss
                            target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> and properly ask for suspension of the <gloss
                            target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Rusk</hi> suggested that while he was sure we all
                        felt this plan to be a good plan, it was still worth while to follow the
                        British suggestion of getting <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> approval in
                        this session of the principles in the majority resolution on Item II. At the
                        same time it was important to avoid any implications that we were closing
                        the door on further discussions in the <gloss target="#t_CCA1"
                        >CCA</gloss>.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Jebb</hi> said that if the Soviets advanced
                        sweeping disarmament proposals, we should join in exposing it as a
                        propaganda maneuver.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the question of a continuation of the <gloss
                            target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss> activities, <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr.
                            Osborn</hi> called attention to the hysterical attacks of the Soviet
                        representatives on the US for suggesting that the <gloss target="#t_CCA1"
                            >CCA</gloss> be continued rather than suspended. From this he deduced
                        that the Soviet line was to have been geared to a US proposal for suspension
                        and he felt it was particularly important, therefore, that we make no move
                        toward suspension at this time. Mr. Rusk then asked whether there was
                        general agreement that in respect to each of the four resolutions we should
                        get as broad joint sponsorship as possible.</p>
                    <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0433"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">General McNaughton</hi> felt this would be fine.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Jebb</hi> stated that at present this seemed a good
                        idea but he was not sure how his government would react and he wondered how
                        we would determine sponsorship, for example, in respect to Resolution IV,
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">General McNaughton</hi> replied that we could have
                        the joint sponsorship depend on those who made up the majority in each case,
                        and that on the general resolution, since there was no majority to fall back
                        on, the British should make up a list. They could best do this because of
                        their wider international contacts and great experience.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Rusk</hi> then inquired whether it would not be
                        well to divide up the generar security debate in Committee I so that
                        different nations could cover different aspects of the problem, for example,
                        the British might advance their views with respect to the “root problem”.
                        There was general agreement that this would be a good idea.</p>
                    <p>At this point <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Osborn</hi> thought it would be useful
                        for <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Jebb’s</hi> benefit to give a picture of how
                        the views of the majority in the <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss> had
                        evolved. The details of Mr. Osborn’s statement will be set forth in a
                        separate memorandum. In general the theme he advanced was to the effect that
                        the original Baruch plan contained elements which might have been elaborated
                        in one of two ways, either in the direction of creating an authoritative and
                        somewhat arbitrary agency or in the direction of an organization based on
                        democratic principled. He believed that the Second Report did the latter
                        through such things as the quota scheme, limitations upon the development of
                        power plants and emphasizing an adequate inspection system rather than a
                        system of sanctions.</p>
                    <p>There was general approval of this interpretation of the Second Report as a
                        useful instrument in winning popular support, provided statements along
                        these lines were sufficiently qualified as being interpretations of the
                        Second Report.</p>
                    <p>Some discussion on dividing up the task of “educating” other delegations in
                        Paris followed. The feeling, was expressed that this should be settled when
                        we got to Paris since little more could be done here.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the educational process referred to in the preceding
                        paragraph, Mr. Rusk questioned whether we should not establish a committee
                        to answer legitimate questions which various delegations might have with
                        respect to atomic energy. The reaction to such a suggestion was generally
                        unfavorable on grounds that this would invite fishing expeditions and could
                        not be properly controlled. It was proposed that instead, this be done
                        through the ordinary diplomatic channels. <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Jebb</hi>
                        suggested, for example, that the US might take upon itself the education of
                        the Latin American delegations. <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Johnson</hi>
                        proposed that in, respect to the Latin Americans, it would be <pb n="414"
                            xml:id="pg_414" facs="0434"/>better for one of their own number to do
                        the educating, for example Mexico.</p>
                    <p>The meeting next turned its attention to the question of what should be done
                        respecting a suggestion such as Secretary General Lie’s that mass weapons
                            considered.<note n="1" xml:id="d226fn1">Reference is to a statement

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">General McNaughton</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr.
                            Osborn</hi> both stated that it was their firm conviction that we need
                        not fear any such tactics since we had already answered such proposals
                        several times on previous occasions, Our answers had generally been along
                        the lines that since a strong and effective safeguards system had already
                        been enveloped in the field of atomic energy, which was by all odds the most
                        important field over which control must be established, the first task was
                        to get acceptance of this control system. Once it had been accepted the
                        international atmosphere would be so changed that all manner of things might
                        then he possible, including measures of control in the field of other mass
                        weapons. At this time, however, it was clear that the same obstacles to
                        establishing effective control would be manifest in the field of other mass
                        weapons as had been experienced in the field of atomic energy. <hi
                            rend="smallcaps">Mr. Osborn</hi> added that he thought there was far
                        less danger of a stampede on such an issue today than a year ago, because
                        the eyes of most of the nations had been opened to the real nature of Soviet
                        objectives. <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Rusk</hi> added the caution, however,
                        that we would need to do some lobbying on this matter and in this he was
                        generally supported.</p>
                    <p>The discussion then turned briefly to the question of whether we should take
                        any initiative in respect to <gloss target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss> and Article
                        48 matters if the Soviets or some small nation did not raise either matter.
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Jebb</hi> replied that he thought we should
                        take the initiative on each case but that we should be sure to instruct the
                        Chairman as to the necessity of discussing one at a time and keeping the
                        debate on an orderly basis in this way. In respect to Article 43 matters <hi
                            rend="smallcaps">Mr. Raynor</hi> suggested that he thought agreement had
                        been reached at Ottawa which would take care of the problem.<note n="2"

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">General McNaughton</hi> said that he was very much
                        against the armed guard proposal being developed in such a way as to create
                        as “young army”. He stated emphatically that he thought the armed guard
                        should be restricted to police work with emphasis on specialists in
                        communications. He added that in his talk with <hi rend="smallcaps"
                            >Secretary General Lie</hi> a couple of weeks ago, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                            >Lie</hi> had agreed completely with him and particularly had agreed
                        that any fighting which had <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0435"/>to be
                        done should be done in the second degree, namely, by national

                        climate of international relationships, and depends for solution on the

                        resulting from the meeting held with the Canadian and U.S. Representatives

                        operating under instructions from them. He indicated that the <gloss

                        until it saw how the four resolutions would work, that the <gloss

                        activities were suspended the Russians would have an effective propaganda
                        line based on US desire to go on to talk about other weapons when it was
                        assured of suspension of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>. He pointed
                        out to us the difficulties of the Labor Party with respect to the
                        disarmament question before the war and stated that the Labor Party’s
                        explanation is that disarmament, including atomic energy, must go hand in
                        hand with collective security. He indicated the <gloss target="#t_FonOff1"

                    <p>Mr. Allen was anxious to discuss this question further with the Department
                        before replying to London. He asked if the United States felt that it could
                        modify its position on Article 43 and the <gloss target="#t_CCA1"
                            >CCA</gloss> adjournment.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Johnson pointed out to Mr. Allen that the obligations which our
                        governments have assumed did not make atomic energy control dependent upon
                        collective security.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rusk suggested that the important parts of the jointly agreed concept
                        were resolutions 1 and 4 and that if the UK were satisfied with a strongly
                        worded resolution on Item 4 that we could probably accommodate our
                        differences of view on Items 2 and 3.<note n="3" xml:id="d229fn3">For
                            identification of the contemplated resolutions, see the record of the

                        connection he suggested that a resolution on these items might indicate
                        grave doubts as to whether or not under existing circumstances universally
                        accepted plans could be formulated.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that it would be advisable if the <gloss target="#t_FonOff1"
                            >FonOff</gloss> were to draft resolutions for further discussions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rusk told Mr. Allen that since the US delegation was leaving on the 13th
                        it would be extremely helpful if we could settle this question during the

                                    may be some feeling in the General Assembly on the part of some
                                    of the delegations that the activities of the United Nations
                                    Atomic Energy Commission should be continued in the hopes that,
                                    given the continuation of discussions and negotiations, it might
                                    be possible for an area of agreement to be reached from which
                                    might arise the possibilities of overall agreement on the
                                    assignment originally given to the Commission. It may be felt
                                    that making a specific assignment to the Commission of
                                    discussing the elimination of other major weapons of mass
                                    destruction would be the most fruitful way for the Commission to
                                    meet again in negotiations. The justification for such an idea
                                    would appear to lie in the facts that <pb n="421"

                                    might be that the circumstances and atmosphere under which it

                                            other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction would

                                            nation responsible for failure to achieve control of
                                            atomic energy would be destroyed by an acknowledgement
                                            that useful work can be done in a closely related field,
                                            and would invalidate the Commission’s conclusion that
                                            the causes of the impasse cannot be broken at the
                                            Commission level.</item>

                                            consider the specific problem of other major weapons
                                            adaptable to mass destruction, it would be difficult,
                                            short of a specific injunction against the possibility,
                                            for the United States or any other member of the
                                            majority of the Commission to prevent the raising of

                                            atomic energy. Thus, regardless of the probable censure
                                            which the Soviet Union might receive from the General
                                            Assembly, the Commission level and not the higher

                                            negotiations on the control of atomic energy would be

                                <item>The three reports of the Atomic Energy Commission have been
                                    transmitted by the Security Council to the General Assembly and
                                    are thus on the agenda of the General Assembly for consideration
                                    in Committee 1. Although the Secretary-General’s comments
                                    relative to other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction in
                                    effect constitute a recommendation to the General Assembly that
                                    it give consideration to the problem, the matter is not as yet
                                    on the agenda. If at some subsequent time it should be formally
                                    placed on the agenda any procedure whereby the Atomic Energy
                                    Commission’s reports and recommendations may be considered
                                    separately from or prior to the matter of other major weapons
                                    adaptable to mass destruction would strengthen the position of
                                    the United States in opposing any consideration at this time by
                                    the Atomic Energy Commission of the problem of other major
                                    weapons adaptable to mass destruction. Conversely, if the two
                                    problems should be considered simultaneously in Committee 1, it
                                    must be expected that it will be more difficult for the United
                                    States to oppose the consideration of other major weapons
                                    adaptable to mass destruction by the Atomic Energy Commission if
                                    the United States and the majority intend to place priority on
                                    the achievement of an endorsement by the General Assembly of the
                                    three reports of the Atomic Energy Commission.</item>

                                <item>In view of the already recognizable tactics of the Soviet
                                    Union in seeking to obscure the jurisdictions of the Atomic
                                    Energy Commission and the Commission for Conventional Armaments
                                    particularly through such tactics as persistent reference to the
                                    General Assembly resolution of December 14, 1946 calling for the
                                    abolition of atomic and other weapons adaptable to mass
                                    destruction, it must be borne in mind that the Soviet Union may
                                    attempt in the discussions in Committee 1 so to involve the
                                    considerations of that Committee that it will be forced to
                                    consider the problems of the international control of atomic
                                    energy, the regulation and reduction of conventional armaments
                                    and armed forces, and the control of other major weapons
                                    adaptable to mass destruction simultaneously. In view of this
                                    possibility this Government must be prepared to prevent any
                                    discussion on other major weapons of mass destruction being used
                                    as a smoke screen for any resolution, particularly if it is of
                                    an omnibus nature, which might threaten the maintenance of the
                                    present jurisdictions of the Atomic Energy Commission and the
                                    Commission for Conventional Armaments or which might jeopardize
                                    what progress has already been made on the assignment of the two

                    <p>On the S. S. <hi rend="italic">America</hi>, on September 17, 1948, Howard
                        Johnson asked me if I would meet with Mr. Osborn, Hayden Raynor, Mr.
                        Blaisdell, and Captain Page Smith,<note n="1" xml:id="d231fn1">Captain
                            Harold P. Smith, Adviser, United States Delegation to the General
                            Assembly; represented the Navy Department at most meetings of the
                            Executive Committee on Regulation of Armaments in 1948.</note> to
                        discuss the Third Report of the Atomic Energy Commission. We met at two
                        o’clock in my stateroom–U38.</p>
                    <p>I asked Mr. Johnson to invite Francis Wilcox, who is the Clerk of the Senate
                        Foreign Relations Committee, and he attended.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Osborn opened the conversation with special emphasis on the position of
                        the United Kingdom Delegation. He said that the Third Report was
                        substantially what the French Representative on the <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                            >AEC</gloss>, Count de Rose, had initiated, and that he wished to have a
                        Resolution for the adoption of the Report by the General Assembly sponsored
                        by all of the fourteen countries which had at one time, or another, favored
                        control through an international agency, under the plan described in the
                        First and Second Reports. He advocated a Resolution in the same language as
                        that one which had been offered in the Security Council and vetoed by the
                        Russian and Ukrainian Delegates. He feared that there was lacking entire
                        agreement with the United Kingdom because they had stated that they would
                        support the Resolution, but wanted to have discussed at the same time, the
                        situation in the <gloss target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss>, and in the Military
                        Staff Committee, with respect to Conventional Armaments and, Peace
                        Forces.</p>
                    <p>After a relatively long statement, Mr. Osborn turned and asked: “Who is going
                        to handle this matter in the General Assembly and in Committee I”?</p>
                    <p>I had been informed by Mr. Johnson that Mr. Osborn knew that that work was
                        assigned to me, but to free the matter from any question at all, I read
                        aloud the letter from Secretary of State Marshall which had been delivered
                        to me by hand in New York before our departure, which is as follows:<note

                    <p>[Here follows Austin’s account of the consideration in June by the Security
                        Council of the Third Report of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission.
                        His record of this exposition includes extracts from statements by various
                        members of the Council.]</p>
                    <p>I did not read all of the foregoing extracts, but did call attention to the
                        support which they show for consideration at a prior level of the
                        substantive question.</p>
                    <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0446"/>
                    <p>I strongly urged that it was unwise, from the point of view of the Senate
                        Resolution and the interest of the American people, to sponsor and advocate
                        such a defeatist resolution as one that suspended negotiations in the <gloss
                            target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> without holding out hope and encouragement
                        for discussions on a higher level.</p>
                    <p>Among the numerous suggestions that I asked them to consider were the
                        following: To so word the Resolution to be introduced in the General
                        Assembly that this defeatist language would be neutralised and that
                        affirmative encouragement for further work on the basis of the plan be
                        given.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Osborn seemed deeply stirred for fear that any change whatever in the
                        language of the Resolution might upset the support which had been gained at
                        great difficulty from the other members of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                            >AEC</gloss>. He expressed apprehension that it might open the door to
                        more difficult relations with Great Britain.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wilcox, at some stage of the negotiation, produced the Resolution adopted
                        by the Senate of which Section 5 contained language not expressly referring
                        to the atomic energy question, but which was of such a nature as to
                        comprehend it, and gave us the history of that language which included a
                        statement to the effect that Senator Vandenberg had called on Under
                        Secretary Lovett about it, and that he had stated that it would embarrass
                        the State Department to put it in there. Afterward, a suggestion was made
                        that atomic energy should be excluded by using the word “conventional”
                        before armaments. The Committee refused to accept that expressly because it
                        would exclude atomic energy.</p>
                    <p>Section (5) of the Resolution reads as follows:</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>“Maximum efforts to obtain agreements to provide the United Nations with
                            armed forces as provided by the Charter, and to obtain agreement among
                            member nations upon universal regulation and reduction of armaments
                            under adequate and dependable guaranty against violation.”</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>September 19, 1948.</p>
                    <p>We had another meeting at which the negotiation became difficult. In the
                        course of it, Hayden Raynor suggested that it would be appropriate to make
                        clear that the recommendation in the Third Report looked forward to
                        consultation by the Permanent Members to find out whether there exists a
                        basis for agreement. I asked Mr. Osborn if he would have any objection to
                        adding a paragraph to the Resolution that would comprehend that point in an
                        affirmative recommendation, that the Permanent Members of the <gloss

                        Resolution of 24 January 1946 continue to seek an agreement on the basis of
                        the First and Second Reports. Thereupon <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427"
                            facs="0447"/>Captain Smith stated that Mr. Forrestal<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d231fn3">James Forrestal, Secretary of Defense.</note> was
                        opposed to any further negotiations anywhere. Being startled by this, I
                        inquired whether the purpose was to totally defeat the proposal of the
                        United States to give up its monopoly upon the conditions contained in the
                        Declaration by the President, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and the
                        Prime Minister of Canada, and contained in the General Assembly Resolution,
                        as well as in the Act of Congress—the Atomic Energy Act. He said: “Yes”;
                        that he understood that this was intended to stop negotiations anywhere. I
                        said to him in effect that I intended to take this matter up in the
                        Delegation at the earliest convenience, and that I hoped he would get Mr.
                        Forrestal and let him know our position. I called attention to the fact that
                        if we did not have negotiations between the Big 5 we would have no way of
                        carrying out even the recommendation of the Third Report, namely: “Find,
                        through prior consultation, that there exists a basis for agreement.”</p>
                    <p>During this conversation, I stated that it looked as if we were right up
                        against a fundamental question of the continued existence of the United
                        Nations because termination of <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> talks and
                        suspension of all negotiations on a prior level would block any conclusion
                        relating to disarmament through <gloss target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss> and the
                        creation of peace forces under Article 43.</p>
                    <p>The question arose distinctly in my mind: “What really is our position?” It
                        seems illogical to strongly advocate a plan that would carry out the policy
                        of the United States, expressed in so many ways, all giving up its monopoly
                        to the world, and in the same Resolution strike it a death blow by
                        terminating discussion.</p>
                    <p>Later in the day, Mr. Osborn called upon me alone, bringing with him a
                        dispatch which was addressed to him personally, and purporting to come from
                        Under Secretary Lovett containing almost the exact terms of the Resolution.
                        Therefore, he convinced me that he was acting under instructions which
                        indicated that Mr. Forrestal concurred in them. My recollection is that that
                        paper was dated in April.<note n="4" xml:id="d231fn4">The paper under
                            reference is presumably document <gloss target="#t_RAC1">RAC</gloss>

                            contemplated resolution, see Osborn’s memorandum of conversation, July
                            28, <ref target="#pg_369">p. 369</ref>.</note> I told him that I had no
                        personal feeling against him in respect to this matter; that I should
                        certainly not attack him in handling the business, but that I should take it
                        up at the first opportunity with the Delegation and discuss it calmly. He
                        offered to collaborate with Mr. Howard Johnson in drafting a speech for me
                        to make in the First Committee. He did that, and I found that the draft
                        concluded with substantially the same views that he had previously
                        expressed: that negotiations in the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> be
                        suspended without accepting any of my suggestions for holding open the hope
                        of further negotiations at a higher level.</p>
                    <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0448"/>
                    <p>Thereupon, I turned the draft over to Porter McKeever, who, with Chester
                        Williams and Gilbert Stewart,<note n="5" xml:id="d231fn5">Public Information
                            Advisers, United States Delegation to the General Assembly.</note> are
                        now helping me to revise it. I had already made notes on it, and I have
                        stated to them what my views are, namely: that we should not discourage the
                        world by this Resolution, but that we could give hope by affirmative support
                        for further discussion at a higher level.</p>
                    <p>We can do this in the beginning in the speech that I am to make in Committee
                        I. I intend to submit such a speech to the Delegation before I use it.</p>

                        the General Assembly.</p>
                    <p>At lunch today General McNaughton told me that he had this morning talked
                        with the Canadian Prime Minister<note n="1" xml:id="d232fn1">William Lyon
                            Mackenzie King, Prime Minister and Chairman of the Canadian Delegation

                        would be strongly pressed. General McNaughton expressed them as follows:</p>
                    <p>They desire the General Assembly to confirm the General Findings and
                        Recommendations of the First Report, the Specific Proposals of the Second
                        Report, and the Report and Recommendations of the Third Report, and to press
                        immediately for the sponsorship of a resolution to this effect by the
                        fourteen nations of the majority. They suggest a conference at the earliest
                        possible date with the delegates of the permanent members, to agree on the
                        exact form of the resolution, following which agreement would be urged on
                        the others of the fourteen.</p>
                    <p>I will follow this up with General McNaughton, the French, British, Chinese,
                        and probably the Belgians. This conference should be held in the next few
                        days.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the above attitude on atomic energy, General McNaughton and
                        the Canadian Prime Minister are strongly opposed to the entire British
                        position—the lumping of Article 43, <gloss target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss> and
                            <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> together, and getting into a general
                        debate on the subject of Soviet intransigence, veto, etc. General McNaughton
                        feels that this <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0449"/>would confuse the
                        atomic energy debate, that we are not ready for “the debate on the other
                        matters because they have not yet been brought far enough along, and says
                        that the Canadian Delegation will bitterly oppose this British view.
                        However, the Canadian Delegation desires to continue the work of the <gloss
                            target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss> until it has been brought to approximately
                        the present position of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>, when it can

                            <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>. He feels that the United States
                        must take the leading role in the discussion, particularly on the merits of
                        the plan, though not to the exclusion of the leading roles to be played by
                        McNaughton of Canada and the British. The basis of the debate should be
                        approval of the First and Second Reports, from which approval of the Third
                        Report naturally follows. He went Over the proposed draft resolution which
                        is similar to the one discussed by the majority delegates to the <gloss

                        Cadogan, de Rose, the Chinese and Osborn—should get together to see if they
                        have any recommendations to make to their respective delegations on the
                        resolution and the handling of it. De Rose feels that it would be a good
                        idea to divide up the different delegations to the <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                            >GA</gloss> among a group of the sponsoring powers so that each

                        on them as to how they will vote. He feels that the time when atomic energy
                        should come up in Committee 1 would depend in part on the issues Vishinsky
                        brings out in his speech. He is against reference to an Ad Hoc Committee;

                    <p>De Rose feels strongly that arrangements should be made for the introduction
                        of an additional resolution, or an amendment to the basic resolution should
                        be proposed by some country not a member of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                            >AEC</gloss> in which the General Assembly would instruct the sponsoring
                        powers to confer and report back at the next meeting of the General
                        Assembly. He says that this proposal has been approved in the Quai d’Orsay
                        and he feels that some positive action should be taken to see that such a
                        resolution or amendment is introduced. He thinks it important that it should
                        be introduced by a European nation, and suggests Norway.</p>
                    <p>De Rose was pleased to know that the British had agreed to debate atomic
                        energy first, and I gather that he does not think well of the British plan
                        of having a general discussion of all disarmament questions.</p>

                            introduced by Andrey Yanuaryevich Vyshinsky, Deputy Foreign Minister of
                            the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Soviet Delegation, during his

                            September 25 (during the general debate phase of proceedings).
                            Vyshinsky’s statement constituted a far-ranging denunciation of United
                            States policy. The Soviet representative devoted considerable attention
                            to the alleged failure of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission
                            and the Commission for Conventional Armaments to achieve positive
                            results. For the record of Vyshinsky’s address, including the official

                            prohibition of production and use of atomic energy for war aims as a
                            task of the first importance; recognizing that general substantial

                    <p>Mr. Osborn and Mr. Rusk outlined the status of the negotiations between the
                        three countries in the handling of the atomic energy question and asked if
                        we were all agreed that the resolution on atomic energy should be sponsored
                        by 14 present and past members of the United Nations Atomic Energy
                        Commission majority.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Allen replied that the United Kingdom would agree to such sponsorship
                        subject to satisfactory working out of a resolution or resotions with
                        respect to Conventional Armaments and Article 43.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rusk suggested that after having completed the General Assembly
                        consideration of the atomic energy question, the General Assembly might
                        consider an over-all resolution as a substitute for Mr. Vyshinsky’s
                        resolution and indicated that it might be easier to obtain a condemnatory
                        paragraph in such an over-all resolution.</p>
                    <p>It was agreed that each of the three countries would prepare a draft of such
                        an over-all resolution and that an effort would then be made to reach
                        agreement upon the various drafts. It was also agreed that a representative
                        of the French Delegation would be included.</p>
                    <p>Finally it was agreed that an approach would be made to the Chairman of
                        Committee I in an effort to persuade him to insist upon completing the
                        Committee discussion on the atomic energy proposals prior to permitting
                        discussion of Mr. Vyshinsky’s resolution.</p>

                        simply being used by the USSR for propaganda purposes. It was decided at
                        that time no further proposals should be considered. The United Kingdom,
                        Canada, Belgium and France felt that negotiations had proceeded too
                        rapidly.</p>
                    <p>In order to put this situation in proper perspective, a report had been
                        prepared. Mr. Osborn noted that American views had been included, and that
                        none of the states had pushed the point of exclusive national interest.
                        However, when it became apparent that the Soviet proposals were nothing more
                        than nonsense, the French had proposed that the Atomic Energy Commission
                        should quit, expressing the view that its work was blocked by the Soviet
                        refusal to consider proposals made by other states. The third report of the
                            <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> resulted from this situation.</p>
                    <p>He pointed out that the Security Council, by reason of the Soviet veto, had
                        been unable to take action on this report. It was now hoped that the General
                        Assembly could adopt a resolution, sponsored by the past and present members
                        of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>, except for the Soviet group,
                        which resolution would almost exactly follow the one vetoed in the Security
                        Council.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Osborn reviewed the provisions of the draft resolution.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d237fn2">For text, see Osborn’s memorandum of conversation, July
                            28, <ref target="#pg_369">p. 369</ref>.</note> This resolution would
                        accept the three reports of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> and
                        recognize that the recommendations of these reports constitute “the
                        necessary basis for establishing an effective system of international
                        control.” It would also call upon all nations to accept the necessary basis
                        for effective control of atomic energy. In addition a supplementary
                        resolution or amendment which could be introduced by a state not a member of
                        the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>, had been prepared. This
                        supplementary resolution would simply request the six principal members of
                        the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> (Canada, China, France, USSR, United
                        Kingdom and United States) to consult, “in order to determine whether there
                        exists a basis for agreement on the international control of atomic energy,
                        and to report the results of their consultations to the next regular meeting
                        of the General Assembly.” Some consideration had been given to the
                        possibility of asking Norway to introduce such a supplementary
                        resolution.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Osborn informed the Delegation that twelve of the fourteen states which
                        had been members of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> were willing
                        jointly to sponsor this resolution. There was some question, however, as to
                        Australia’s position. It was explained that the resolution would be
                        discussed in another informal meeting with representatives of Canada, the
                        UK, and France before a final decision was made as to the exact <pb n="434"
                            xml:id="pg_434" facs="0454"/>terms in which it should be introduced in
                        the General Assembly, presumably by General McNaughton (Canada).</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rusk indicated that there would foe no serious trouble as regards the
                        approval of the First, Second and Third Reports of the <gloss
                            target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>. The approval of the Third Report would
                        emphasize the political impasse which had developed among the commission
                        members and would indicate the necessity of a political solution if the
                            <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> were to conclude its work. In any
                        event, under present circumstances there was serious objection to the
                        commission continuing the technical phase of its work. Mr. Rusk believed the
                        great difficulty was to decide what should be done next. The implication of
                        the major resolution was that the sponsoring powers should move ahead. The
                        real issue was the subject of the supplementary resolution—whether there
                        existed a basis for the continued work in the United Nations on Atomic
                        Energy. Mr. Howard Johnson said the greatest importance should be attached
                        to obtaining joint sponsorship of the resolution. If it were introduced by
                        the United States alone, the onus of suspicion would fall upon the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Austin strongly favored the resolution and believed it was
                        absolutely necessary to supplement it by the additional proposal which would
                        make possible consideration of the problem on the higher political level. He
                        noted that the USSR and Ukraine had already charged the United States with
                        terminating rather than suspending the work of the commission. It was a
                        matter for further political negotiations on the high level. He indicated
                        that de Rose (France) and McNaughton were strong advocates of this
                        approach.</p>
                    <p>Speaking on the language of the supplementary resolution, Ambassador Austin
                        proposed it should be altered to read “to determine <hi rend="italic"
                            >when</hi> there exists a basis for agreement on the international
                        control of atomic energy, and <hi rend="italic">thereupon to terminate the
                            suspension hereby voted</hi>” and to delete the word “regular”,
                        referring to the meeting of the General Assembly so that if agreement were
                        reached early and a Special Session of the Assembly were convened, the
                        subject could be taken up at that time. He believed the delay to the next
                        Regular Assembly Session struck a discouraging note and would tend to
                        undermine confidence; his amendment struck a more hopeful tone.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cohen<note n="3" xml:id="d237fn3">Benjamin V. Cohen, Alternate Member of
                            the United States Delegation; Counselor, Department of State, September
                            1945–July 1947.</note> suggested the resolution might even require the
                        Security Council to reconvene the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>. He
                        suggested that the supplementary resolution might then be amended to read,
                        “and thereupon to require the Security Council to reconvene the <gloss
                            target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> to resume its work, and in any event to
                        report the results of their consultation to the next regular meeting of the
                        General Assembly.”</p>
                    <p>There was a general discussion as to whether it was desirable to provide for
                        a report to any session of the General Assembly. If the <pb n="435"
                            xml:id="pg_435" facs="0455"/>language were simply “to report to the
                        Assembly” it might be considered that there was an obligation to report back
                        to the present session. Moreover, it might not be desirable to make it
                        mandatory for a special session to take up this matter, particularly if
                        there was another reason making it desirable to hold the agenda of the
                        special session to a single item. Mr. Osborn suggested that the change
                        proposed by Mr. Cohen, involving reference to the Security Council made it
                        desirable to return to the original language, the next regular meeting of
                        the General Assembly. Mr. Ross<note n="4" xml:id="d237fn4">John C. Ross,
                            Adviser, United States Delegation Deputy to the United States
                            Representative at the United Nations.</note> suggested that the language
                        might simply refer to a report to the United Nations, but Mr. Osborn felt
                        that the Assembly was entitled to receive such a report.</p>
                    <p>Mr. McKeever<note n="5" xml:id="d237fn5">Porter McKeever, Public Information
                            Adviser, United States Delegation.</note> noted that at the time the
                            <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> had voted to suspend its operations
                        there had been a great deal of public information work necessary to avoid
                        the idea that it was not a suspension but a change to a higher level of
                        negotiation. At that time the press had conveyed the impression that the
                        United States was responsible for suspension, and he thought it would be
                        imperative in this debate to indicate clearly that the United States is
                        simply seeking a way in which negotiation on atomic energy can be
                        resumed.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary asked for the views of the military advisors on this matter.
                        Admiral Hewitt<note n="6" xml:id="d237fn6">Adm. H. K. Hewitt, Adviser,
                            United States Delegation; United States Navy Representative to the
                            United Nations Military Staff Committee.</note> stated that he believed
                        any further technical work should be suspended and that it should be made
                        clear that the United States has done everything possible to reach an
                        agreement in this matter. Under the circumstances at this time it was
                        impossible to proceed further with the work. He indicated that the
                        Department of National Defense considered that no further steps could be
                        taken without prejudicing the national security. General Crittenberger,<note
                            n="7" xml:id="d237fn7">Lt Gen. Willis D. Crittenberger, Adviser, United

                        comments, indicated his agreement to the amendment of the supplementary
                        resolution which had been suggested; and Admiral Hewitt agreed. Concurring
                        in these views, General Harmon<note n="8" xml:id="d237fn8">Lt. Gen. H. R.
                            Harmon, Adviser, United States Delegation; United States Air Force
                            Representative to the United Nations Military Staff Committee.</note>
                        stated that he had no additional comments.</p>
                    <p>Returning to the question whether a report should be made to the next meeting
                        of the Assembly or to its next regular meeting, Mr. Rusk stated that while
                        it was probably not desirable to commit a special session to consideration
                        of this proposal, if the resolution merely referred “to the General
                        Assembly”, it could be made clear in the debate that no report was to be
                        made to the present session and the matter would be left open. Ambassador
                        Austin preferred to make the resolution <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436"
                            facs="0456"/>clear on this point. Mr. Gross<note n="9" xml:id="d237fn9"
                            >Ernest A. Gross, Alternate Member, United States Delegation; Legal
                            Adviser, Department of State.</note> thought it would be desirable not
                        to preclude consideration, if necessary, by a special session. Mr.
                            Jessup<note n="10" xml:id="d237fn10">Philip C. Jessup, Member of the
                            United States Delegation; Deputy Chief, United States Mission at the
                            United Nations.</note> believed that the rewording suggested by Mr.
                        Cohen probably took care of this matter; if the consultations achieved
                        affirmative results the matter could go to the Security Council and then on.
                        If the results were negative, the matter could go over to the next General
                        Assembly.</p>
                    <p>Mr. McKeever asked why it was thought necessary to have another state
                        introduce the supplementary resolution. He thought it might be desirable to
                        associate the United States with the idea of further consultation. Mr.
                        Osborn replied that other delegations and the United States feel that the
                        USSR does not mean business on this matter, and if the supplementary
                        resolution is introduced by another state, it will make clear that the
                        sponsoring states had no hope of achieving agreement by further
                        consultations. Otherwise, their position in the Third Report would be
                        contradicted.</p>

                    <p>General McNaughton explained the initiative taken by the Canadian Delegation
                        in this manner; that Canada moved the resolution in the Security Council
                        referring the question to the Assembly and hence had taken the initiative in
                        calling this meeting today. He indicated that the Canadian Delegation wished
                        to carry its knowledge and convictions on the subject of atomic energy to
                        the General Assembly. He indicated the belief that the Soviet Union
                        ultimately would have to accept the Atomic Energy Commission proposal and
                        that he did not wish to make it more difficult to bring the Soviet bloc in.
                        He hoped that all members of the Atomic Energy Commission could agree upon
                        joint sponsorship of a General Assembly resolution approving their work. He
                        also expressed the hope that all of the members of the Atomic Energy
                        Commission majority could help in carrying the plan to other members. Mr.
                        Osborn spoke of the endless efforts of the members of the majority and the
                        frustration in the Atomic Energy Commission as the result of the Soviet
                        tactics. He stated that the majority had worked informally together in a
                        spirit of closest cooperation. He stated that as long as 18 months ago the
                        Department of State had become convinced that the Soviet Union was not
                        serious about atomic energy control and was using the Atomic Energy
                        Commission as a propaganda forum only. But at that time other delegates
                        decided to carry the work further and we were glad to do so with them.
                        However, by this spring all the delegates of the major countries came to the
                        conclusion that there was a complete impasse and that it was necessary to
                        bring the matter to the General Assembly in the way now planned. The
                        remaining items involved questions of national interest and are largely
                        political; for instance, the United States position on stages, if written
                        under present conditions of Soviet preparation for war would necessarily be
                        very stiff, while if the Soviet had shown real evidences of world
                        cooperation they might be quite different. He said it was our feeling that
                        the General Assembly should approve the plan resulting from this earnest
                        work of the Atomic Energy Commission or repudiate it.</p>
                    <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0458"/>
                    <p>Mr. de Rose indicated that he had no reluctance in taking part in the debate
                        but that we should have a carefully planned method of handling the debate.
                        He suggested that various delegations divide up the task of explaining the
                        proposals; one for instance might explain ownership; another the functions
                        of the Agency, etc. He suggested that further meetings of this group be held
                        in an effort to carefully plan the debate in Committee I.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Wei said that he would state his conviction on the plan in-presenting the
                        case to Committee I; that the main purpose was to obtain support of the
                        General Assembly for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> proposals, and to
                        understand that there was no alternative, and that the Soviet propaganda was
                        wholly untrue.</p>
                    <p>Dr. van Roijen indicated that his country would support joint sponsorship. He
                        indicated great ignorance on the part of most countries and emphasized the
                        importance of explaining generally the extent to which this plan has been
                        worked out in detail. He agreed with de Rose’s views on procedure and stated
                        that it would be necessary to work out agreement on the actual wording of a
                        resolution.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Rolin who will represent Belgium in the debate, then spoke. (Mr. van
                        Langenhove had previously advised us that Dr. Rolin, President of the
                        Belgian Senate, had just come in and was not yet briefed on atomic energy.)
                        Dr. Rolin indicated that in his personal view the key to the world political
                        situation was disarmament—especially atomic energy control. He felt that
                        Soviet fear of atomic weapons may be the cause of the Soviet attitude. He
                        indicated that something must be done to bring to the public the fact that
                        the majority have agreed upon a real plan. He stated, however, that the
                        Atomic Energy Commission members should consider amendments, giving hope
                        that agreement will be possible and to prevent giving the impression that
                        the majority opposed any change. It is better, he said, to give the
                        impression that we are ready for open discussion rather than give an
                        ultimatum to the Soviet Union from the start. It was his feeling that the
                        Security Council resolution should not be the starting point for drafting a
                        General Assembly resolution which, in his view, must be meaningful in
                        itself. It was also his view that the Third Report was too negative in
                        speaking of the impasse; that the General Assembly must make possible a last
                        effort to reach agreement; He was convinced that nothing more could be done
                        but that we should not accept the recommendation of the Third Report.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Arce expressed the view that we should commence our discussions by
                        acceptance of the fact that the Soviet Union does not want agreement. He
                        stated that she is working on the bomb and does not want others to see what
                        she is doing. He felt that the United States should say that it must hold
                        the weapon to save the world against <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0459"
                        />the time when the Soviet Union would get it. He felt it important to get a
                        great majority of the General Assembly to approve the Atomic Energy
                        Commission proposals. He felt that in Committee I the approach of Mr. de
                        Rose was sound but that in the General Assembly itself there should be a
                        reply to the speeches of the Soviet bloc. The plan must be explained in
                        simple terms in Committee I, and the discussion must terminate by the
                        approval of a resolution. In his opinion, the Latin American Delegations
                        will support the plan. (He later asked Mr. Osborn to have the United States
                        contact the Caribbean countries.) In his view, the Vyshinsky resolution<note
                            n="7" xml:id="d238fn7">For text, see telegram <gloss target="#t_Delga1"
                                >Delga</gloss> 117, September 25, <ref target="#pg_431">p.
                            431</ref>.</note> was pure bluff, introduced for the purpose of
                        confusion, and had no relation to the Atomic Energy Commission proposal.
                        These should be kept completely separate. It was his suggestion that, in
                        Committee I, four or five delegations who best knew the proposals should
                        take the lead.</p>
                    <p>Sir Alexander Cadogan stated that it was important for the majority to
                        continue to stand together. He indicated that although the Security Council
                        resolution was negative, that the United Kingdom thought it its duty to show
                        what the situation was, and that continuing would be deluding the public. He
                        stated, however, that the resolution had a positive objective—that the
                        General Assembly might give some impulse to the question. It was his view
                        that Soviet interventions would make it difficult to carry out de Rose’s
                        plan for dividing up the presentation and expressed the view that several
                        governments would have to give a complete presentation at the beginning. He
                        felt that a certain amount of repetition was necessary.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Urdaneta agreed with the comments of Dr. Arce and Sir Alexander Cadogan.
                        He expressed the view that if three points were made clear the Latin
                        American countries would give their full support: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                        The Soviet position; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) if we can prevent confusing
                        the consideration of the Atomic Energy proposals by direct discussion of the
                        Soviet proposal and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) that the plan does not
                        constitute intervention in domestic affairs.</p>
                    <p>The Reporter from Brazil stated that Brazil would probably have no objection
                        to joint sponsorship.</p>
                    <p>General McNaughton expressed the view that the resolution must be more
                        understandable than the technical resolution of the Security Council and
                        stated he would frame such a resolution and circulate it privately.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Rolin expressed the view that the resolution should not be introduced at
                        the start but after a general discussion. He agreed with General McNaughton
                        that the discussion on atomic energy sfypuld be kept entirely separate from
                        the discussion of Vyshinsky’s resolution. General McNaughton then stated
                        that he assumed there was a consensus <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440"
                            facs="0460"/>that the debate on these questions should be kept separate,
                        and that we must insist that Committee I itself and not a Subcommittee
                        discuss the atomic energy matter.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Arce suggested that General McNaughton show the resolution, in the first
                        instance, to the United States, United Kingdom, France, China, Belgium and
                        Canada, and then to the other members of the Atomic Energy Commission
                        majority. This suggestion was approved.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Osborn stated that he would send 10 copies of the pamphlet prepared in
                        the United States, containing the Atomic Energy Commission proposals, to
                        each Delegation of the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> majority and that
                        the French were printing, in French, a somewhat similar pamphlet. He
                        suggested the advisability of dividing up the work of the educating of the
                        various member nations by the members of this group.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Wei stated that it was important that existing bombs be destroyed but
                        that it was more important to destroy the mechanism for making more
                        bombs.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Osborn explained that, quite contrary to plans and expectations,
                        Committee I was taking up at its meeting today, as the first item on its
                        agenda, the question of atomic energy.<note n="1" xml:id="d239fn1">At its
                            143rd Meeting, September 29, the First Committee decided to place atomic
                            energy first on its agenda, over the objections of the Soviet Union
                            which desired to have its draft resolution On disarmament considered
                            first (for text, see telegram <gloss target="#t_Delga1">Delga</gloss>
                            117, September 25, <ref target="#pg_431">p. 431</ref>). This decision
                            was also contrary to the position of the United States and the United
                            Kingdom who wished to have the question of Palestine considered first

                        draft resolution, he explained, followed that of the vetoed Security Council
                        resolution on this subject, and the introductory “whereas” clauses were
                        drawn almost directly from the Third Report of the Atomic Energy

                    <p>Mr. Jessup inquired whether it was still contemplated that another state
                        should introduce the supplementary resolution calling upon permanent members
                        to consult on this matter. Mr. Osborn said it was too soon to say, but it
                        could probably be worked out during the debate. Mr. Cohen suggested that it
                        might perhaps be better to incorporate it into the main resolution. Mr.
                        Osborn indicated, however, that the majority of the States which had sat on
                        the Atomic Energy Committee felt that it was important to make a clear
                        statement, so far as they were concerned, that further negotiations were of
                        no value. Mr. Cohen said he had made his proposal on the assumption that it
                        was desirable to make the door always open, and he regarded this approach as
                        quite important psychologically. Mr. Rusk said this question of tactics had
                        been discussed with the National Security Council and with a special Senate
                        committee to clarify the situation. It had been agreed that it was not
                        appropriate for the United States to introduce a Resolution asking it and
                        the other powers to undertake further negotiations, after which the Assembly
                        might very well simply tell these states to go ahead and negotiate.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dulles<note n="4" xml:id="d239fn4">John Foster Dulles, Member of the
                            United States Delegation; an expert on foreign policy in the Republican
                            Party.</note> inquired whether consideration had been given to the idea
                        of going ahead and drawing up a convention on atomic energy, to become
                        effective when it was approved by a majority of states, including the five
                        permanent members of the Security Council. Such an approach, he observed,
                        indicated a disposition to proceed with the work. It would negate charges
                        that the United States is calling off <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442"
                            facs="0462"/>negotiations and starting the race for atomic energy. Mr.
                        Osborn indicated that this approach had been discussed last year. Although
                        several states had initially favored the preparation of such a treaty, at
                        the present time only Syria felt that a treaty should be completed, to deal
                        with such things as sanctions, quotas, and strategic distribution. Other
                        states, however, feel that it would be impossible to write a comprehensive
                        treaty without introducing into it the stages of control. The Congress and
                        the American public would demand a treaty with strict control stages,
                        including inspection. A treaty which would not affront the United States
                        opinion would give the Soviets a tremendous propaganda opportunity. He
                        believed, moreover, that it was impractical to consider action of this sort,
                        knowing that one of the states would not accept the convention. Mr. Dulles
                        interpreted these statements as meaning that the United States program on
                        the control of atomic energy was so tough that it could not be proposed to
                        the U.S.S.R. without giving them tremendous propaganda opportunities. Mr.
                        Rusk indicated that this was a correct view. Mr. Dulles wondered whether the
                        fourth paragraph of the resolution<note n="5" xml:id="d239fn5">Paragraph 4
                            of document A/C.1/308, the Canadian resolution, read as follows:
                                <p>“Whereas only if traditional economic and political practices are
                                adapted to the overriding requirements of international security can
                                these proposals be implemented.”</p>
                        </note> was necessary. It raised the question whether it was in the national
                        interest to develop international control. Mr. Osborn said that he would
                        discuss the deletion of this paragraph, with the British and Canadians and
                        thought its omission could probably be agreed upon.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gross questioned the phraseology of Paragraph 7,<note n="6"
                            xml:id="d239fn6">Paragraph 7 read as follows: <p>“Whereas the Commission
                                now reports that it has been unable to secure the agreement of the
                                Soviet Union to even those elements of effective control considered
                                essential from the technical point of view, let alone their
                                acceptance of the nature and extent of participation in the world
                                community required of all nations in this field by the first and
                                second reports of the Atomic Energy Commission.”</p>
                        </note> which he thought might introduce unnecessary controversy; Mr. Jessup
                        thought, however, it was important for the United States to face up firmly
                        to the Soviet propaganda, indicating that this precise language came from
                        the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> Third Report, and commented it would
                        be dangerous to introduce new language into such a complex subject at the
                        eleventh hour.</p>

                        Atomic Energy Commission to resume the remainder of the work contemplated
                        for it by the original General Assembly Resolution, namely, the drafting of
                        a treaty.<note n="2" xml:id="d240fn2">The Syrian amendment, A/C.1/309, was

                        progress in the field of atomic energy control. On the contrary, he said the
                        process of drafting a treaty would make very much clearer to everyone who
                        had not actively worked on atomic energy exactly what the specific points of
                        difference are with the Russians, and thus this would further serve the
                        purpose of revealing the true position of the Russians.</p>

                            Disarmament Proposal</hi> (Mr. Osborn)</p>
                    <p>Mr. Osborn explained that immediately after Vishinsky had introduced his
                        proposal, a series of informal meetings had been started with the British
                        and Canadians, to which the French had now been <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444"
                            facs="0464"/>added. These three states and the United States had more or
                        less agreed on a common strategy. Discussions with other Delegations
                        indicated support for their position. First of all, he said, it was agreed
                        that the Vishinsky proposal must be completely separated from the problem of
                        atomic energy. It must be thoroughly debated and then voted down. Any
                        amendments would also be voted down. Then an entirely new resolution could
                        be presented, debated and adopted. Mr. Osborn noted that Dr. Evatt<note
                            n="1" xml:id="d241fn1">Herbert V. Evatt, Chairman of Australian
                            Delegation and President of the Third Session of the General Assembly;
                            Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of External Affair of Australia;
                            Australian Representative to the united Nations Atomic Energy
                            Commission.</note> had been talking of the possibility of amending the
                        Vishinsky resolution. The main purpose of the four states was to draft a
                        sound resolution on this subject, which at the same time would have
                        propaganda value. He indicated that the French member of the group had
                        termed Vishinsky’s proposals sheer hypocrisy, which deserved a little
                        hypocrisy in return, particularly so that the final product would actually
                        mean something to the man on the street.</p>
                    <p>The four states had divided into two working groups; the first was attempting
                        to draft a resolution embodying a sound approach to the problem, the second
                        was working along the line of a propaganda resolution which at the same time
                        would be safe technically. Mr. Osborn expected that both drafts would fee
                        available by tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary inquired what the French attitude was, pointing out that to a
                        large extent France was already disarmed. He wondered how they could discuss
                        this situation, which he compared to that of a penniless man talking to a
                        millionaire. It seemed to him there was a tremendous propaganda opportunity
                        to exploit the disarmament of France as opposed to the immense armaments of
                        U.S.S.R.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dulles asked whether a substitute resolution or an amendment was being
                        considered. Mr. Osborn replied that a substitute resolution was thought
                        essential, so that the Vishinsky resolution would be decisively voted down
                        and the Soviet Union could not subsequently claim credit for the resolution
                        which had been approved, even though it might have been amended.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cohen believed that the greatest effort should be made not simply to get
                        out propaganda slogans but to circulate concrete facts on this matter. He
                        thought it was important to get over the idea that the great danger in
                        armaments was the unbalance between Western Europe and the Soviets. The rest
                        of the world was not important in this regard. In his view, the best
                        propaganda was insured by sound policy. He thought it would be important to
                        refer to this problem in terms of ideas, enumerating, for example the issues
                        which the Soviets refused to settle, the actual settlement of which, could
                        pave the way for disarmament.</p>
                    <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0465"/>
                    <p>Commenting on Mr. Osborn’s remarks, Mr. Ross observed that there seemed to be
                        complete agreement that discussion of the Vishinsky resolution should be
                        sharply separated from the atomic energy item. He believed this would be
                        extremely difficult, since the Soviets had failed to get the first place on
                        the Committee 1 agenda for their proposal. He commented that it was
                        important to make sure that some of the best debaters for our side, like
                        Hector McNeil,<note n="2" xml:id="d241fn2">Sir Hector McNeil, Member of the
                            United Kingdom Delegation to the General Assembly; Minister of State,

                        debate to discussion of Soviet material. As for the question of amendment of
                        the Vishinsky resolution, he believed the experience last year on the Soviet
                        proposal on war mongering provided a lesson.<note n="3" xml:id="d241fn3">For

                        that at that time considerable sentiment developed in favor of meeting the
                        Soviet proposal. For this reason, careful plans should be made in this case
                        to lay the ground by political negotiation for a position against any
                        amendments. Such political work should be taken immediately, before
                        amendments were presented.</p>

                        introduction of the Soviet resolution on atomic energy, October 2.<note

                            October 2, Andrey Y. Vyshinsky, the Soviet Representative, submitted a
                            draft resolution (A/C.1/310) which read as follows: <p>“The General
                                Assembly,</p>
                            <p>Having examined the first, second and third reports of the Atomic

                                Council and of the Atomic Energy Commission directed towards
                                implementing General Assembly resolution 1 (I) of 24 January 1946 on
                                the establishment of a commission to deal with the problems raised
                                by the discovery of atomic energy and of resolution 41 (I) of 14
                                December 1946 on principles governing the general regulation and
                                reduction of armaments have not so far yielded positive results,</p>
                            <p>Considering the paramount importance of implementing the

                        resolution repudiated the terms of reference of the Atomic Energy Commission
                        established by the General Assembly, but indicated that this was the same
                        interpretation which the U.S.S.R. had made all along. In addition, a
                        resolution had been introduced by Syria<note n="2" xml:id="d242fn2"

                        Energy Commission and stated that, if the U.S.S.R. would not negotiate, the
                        remaining states should negotiate a treaty. Affirmative action on this
                        resolution would cause difficulty. The other resolution before Committee 1,

                        the work of the Atomic Energy Commission for the last two years and at the

                    <p>Mr. Osborn explained that it was contemplated that the debate this week would
                        review the general plan and set the stage for action acceptable to the
                        United States. Ambassador Austin would discuss the control of nuclear
                        plants; General McNaughton would discuss the mining and production of
                        nuclear materials; M. de Hose would discuss inspection. Ambassador Austin
                        pointed out that this approach would go directly to the issue and unrelated
                        discussions would be foreclosed.</p>
                    <p>Following Mr. Osborn’s explanation, Ambassador Austin stated that no action
                        on this matter was necessary by the Delegation.</p>

                            that Baruch make an early statement on atomic energy “offsetting

                            indicated that Baruch was preparing a statement, but “would appreciate a
                            draft which Arneson could prepare of what you would like him to say.”
                            (501.BB/9–2848) Arneson and Osborn submitted certain points which Baruch
                            might make, rather than offering the complete text of a statement, in

                                    contained a further explanation by Baruch of his position, which
                                    read as follows: <p>“As to stimulating sentiment on the
                                        soundness of the American position and supporting it in the
                                        face of the attacks made by Vishinsky, that is already under
                                        way. No sooner had I heard from the General through you than
                                        I began to work with various elements of the press and radio
                                        so that the American position would be strongly supported by
                                        American public opinion. That effort is already bearing
                                        fruit. Editorials of the type that the <hi rend="italic"
                                            >Herald Tribune</hi> printed yesterday, Tuesday, and
                                        reprinted in Paris, Wednesday, are being published
                                        throughout America. So are supporting commentaries on the
                                        air. The counter-propaganda is well under way.</p>
                                    <p>As to a statement from me, without a formal request that I
                                        make it, I and my associates are quite certain that this
                                        would be unwise and too self-serving to be effective. It
                                        would look as if I were patting myself on the back without
                                        any seeming justification for that action. More particularly
                                        since the problem clearly is in Paris, not this country, and
                                        I am not at all certain what action the situation there
                                        calls for.</p>
                                    <p>If the Department were to ask me for support, it would be my
                                        duty as well as my privilege as an American. But, as I say,
                                        unless the request were made, it would look as if I were
                                        merely tooting my own horn and I question the wisdom of the
                                        Department making such a request.</p>
                                    <p>I should be glad to talk to General Marshall on his arrival

                    <p>Today I received an undated document marked “secret” which referred to
                        something on the French radio this morning in which they spoke of the
                        necessity for debunking the Soviet maneuver in “simplest phraseology
                        possible and that full emphasis be placed upon crux matter, all too often
                        veiled by need for technical and semitechnical explanations in Committee
                        meetings.” Then it went on to tell what should fee done and what should be
                        said here.<note n="2" xml:id="d244fn2">Document not identified.</note>

                    <p>The last paragraph reads “Secretary has seen foregoing and concurs. He tells
                        me he has been urging such counterpropaganda reaction especially by

                    <p>For the life of me I cannot see why Austin, Osborn and Arneson are not ready
                        to do exactly what they said they want done here. They should do it on the
                        scene and on the same level from which the propaganda is sent forth.</p>
                    <p>The American newspapers, especially in all the editorials, know just exactly
                        what is taking place and they have defended the American position in a very
                        logical and simple manner. For instance, here is one from the <hi

                    <p>The jitters of the French, which may or may not be their own ideas and might
                        be stimulated by other countries, are exactly what I had to meet in the
                        Atomic Energy Commission. This was overcome by stating exactly where we
                        would stand, if we had to stand alone, by arguments which were presented
                        daily to the Commission showing the hollowness of the various contentions
                        against the majority proposals, and constantly keeping the press and radio
                        advised.</p>
                    <p>I spent most of my time talking with members of the delegations and showing
                        up the various Soviet counterproposals. That is what ought to be done now.
                        If we haven’t sufficient men over there, let them get them.</p>
                    <p>I would like to call your attention again to the resolution of the General

                    <p>The move by Vishinsky in which he suggested outlawing the bomb simultaneously
                        with the setting up of a committee of inspection is <pb n="450"
                            xml:id="pg_450" facs="0470"/>absurd on its face, because if we outlaw
                        the bomb, that settles that. But it will take great patience and time to set
                        up the control and inspection. And, don’t forget that one of the important
                        parts was the setting up of punishment, swift, sure and condign, of a
                        violator. The Soviet proposals are only another form of the pious
                        Kellogg-Briand pacts. The thing has to be done in a package and done with
                        effective safeguards and by stages. The only thing that stands in the way of
                        the over-running of Europe today is the atom bomb. When once we outlaw that,
                        there is nothing to stop the Russian advance.</p>
                    <p>I do not see why, if we outlaw the bomb, we should not outlaw war itself, but
                        you could not do that until you set up inspection, control and punishment to
                        see that no one broke the agreement.</p>
                    <p>And, as I once told you, until America makes up its mind what it wants in
                        peace and makes some global peace suggestions, it seems to me we will be on
                        the defense continually, with our opponents choosing a field here, there and
                        every where.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Osborn explained that, after six days of debate in Committee 1, the
                        Soviet bloc had been able to keep the situation sufficiently confused so
                        that the majority of the delegates did not correctly understand the issues
                        involved and the various proposals which had been introduced. The debate had
                        started with the introduction by General McNaughton of a resolution
                        approving the reports of the Atomic Energy Commission and stating that its
                        work should be suspended until the USSR agreed to participate on the
                        majority basis.<note n="1" xml:id="d246fn1">For information regarding the

                    <p>Subsequently, a number of other resolutions had been submitted. Syria had
                        proposed an amendment calling for the conclusion of the convention even
                        though such a convention might not be agreed to by the USSR.<note n="2"

                        could best be worked out in sub-committee, although Mr. Osborn noted that
                        this proposal presupposed that the USSR would agree with the majority, which
                        it had failed to do for the last two years in the Atomic Energy
                        Commission.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Vyshinsky had confused the debate further by the introduction of a
                        resolution which would have repudiated all the work that had been done by
                        the Atomic Energy Commission and which would require starting over on the
                        basis of the action of the General Assembly <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452"
                            facs="0472"/>in 1946, as this action was interpreted by the USSR.<note
                            n="4" xml:id="d246fn4">For text of the Soviet resolution, A/C.1/310, see
                            footnote 1, <ref target="#pg_445">p. 445</ref>.</note> Mr. Osborn noted
                        that from the time Mr. Vyshinsky had introduced his proposal, it had become
                        apparent that a majority of the Assembly delegations simply did not
                        understand the problem.</p>
                    <p>With one speaker inscribed on the list, the Chairman of the Committee had
                        announced that after this speaker, the debate would be closed and the
                        Committee would proceed to vote. Ambassador Austin, recognizing that the
                        Committee was not ready to vote, had discussed the situation with the
                        Canadian representative, who then asked for an adjournment on the grounds
                        that he wished to modify his original proposal. This was the situations of
                        last night.</p>
                    <p>During the evening, members of the Delegation, including Ambassador Austin
                        and Mr. Osborn, had met with the British, French, Belgians and Canadians.
                        Mr. Osborn said that Rolin, McNeil and Parodi had argued insistently that
                        the temper of the Assembly required the appointment of a sub-committee to go
                        into the various atomic energy proposals. Although Ambassador Austin had
                        pointed out the difficulties which such a procedure would raise (in
                        particular, having to debate the Vyshinsky resolution), the others had still
                        insisted on a drafting sub-committee, and he reluctantly agreed. Mr. Osborn
                        pointed out that with this adverse sentiment it was doubtful whether, if the
                        United States had pushed for an immediate vote, it could have obtained a
                        significant majority in favor of its position.</p>
                    <p>After it was agreed to constitute a sub-committee, Mr. McNeil promised to
                        arrange for New Zealand to introduce the amendment previously discussed,
                        asking the sponsoring powers to consult and to report the results of their
                        consultations to the next meeting of the Assembly. After this resolution was
                        introduced, the Canadians would accept the idea of a drafting committee. Mr.
                        Osborn thought that it was very likely that the drafting committee would
                        report on the Canadian resolution, plus the amendment introduced by New
                        Zealand, together with a minority proposal by the USSR. Under these
                        circumstances, he believed there would be no question that the United States
                        would obtain a substantial majority for its position.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Austin emphasized that the present situation was one which, if not
                        handled carefully, could result in the acceptance of the Syrian amendment to
                        proceed to the drafting of a convention. This was true because the chairman
                        of the Committee had announced that he would put the amendments to the vote
                        in the order in which they had been submitted. In fact, Ambassador Austin
                        believed that unless the sub-committee were successful, the Committee would
                        still approve the Syrian amendment. He felt the Canadian resolution as
                        amended <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0473"/>would hold out great
                        promise to the other delegations since it contemplated unanimity, and, if
                        the Assembly strongly backed the idea of further consultations, there was a
                        chance agreement might be reached. In other words, the events of the last
                        six days’ debate had brought the United Nations to a parting of the ways,
                        and if he had not gone along with the views of the others last night, the
                        United States position would have been severely beaten on the vote.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Austin did not think a sub-committee was necessary, but hoped that
                        its work might make the other members of the United Nations understand the
                        actual situation among the five great powers. He hoped that the
                        sub-committee would serve as a sort of solvent in this increasingly
                        difficult situation. The Secretary asked for other comments and himself
                        pointed out that this problem must be considered in relation to the total
                        present situation regarding the maintenance of international peace.</p>

                        reaching agreement on a resolution for submission to the Committee.<note

                            (III/1), <hi rend="italic">First Committee</hi>, pp. 85–96.</note>
                        Ambassador Austin explained that Committee I had concluded a rather
                        tumultuous debate yesterday with the adoption of a resolution for a
                        sub-committee of 11 members. Among the eleven were the six sponsoring
                        Powers. He noted that the sub-committee had limited terms of reference—to
                        deal with the resolutions offered by various members and to prepare an
                        agreed draft. Mr. Osborn would sit on the sub-committee while Ambassador
                        Austin would participate in the disarmament discussions of Committee I,
                        which would take up disarmament pending the report of the sub-committee on
                        atomic energy.</p>
                    <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0474"/>
                    <p>Mr. Osborn felt the sub-committee was a strong one and expressed the hope
                        that it would report out a strong resolution for which most Members could
                        vote. Mr. Dulles asked whether it was contemplated that such a resolution
                        would keep the Atomic Energy Commission alive. Mr. Osborn replied that it
                        might be possible to change the wording of the Canadian resolution so that
                        the effect will be the same without using the word “suspended”. He believed
                        the United States should stand firm on its refusal to go back to the Atomic
                        Energy Commission and begin all over again.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Austin emphasized two points: (1) the necessity of adhering to the
                        work of the Atomic Energy Commission as clone and of obtaining substantial
                        support for it from the General Assembly, and (2) to keep the fire of hope
                        burning in order to carry out the exact spirit of the General Assembly
                        action on atomic energy. Those were the two points he believed the United
                        States should fight for in the sub-committee.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Blaisdell noted that the Delegation had already taken a decision on the
                        Canadian and New Zealand resolutions<note n="3" xml:id="d247fn3">For
                            information on the Canadian resolution, A/C.1/308, see footnoted, <ref
                                target="#pg_441">p. 441</ref>. The New Zealand resolution,
                            A/C.1/314, introduced October 7, read as follows: <p>“The General
                                Assembly requests the sponsors of General Assembly resolution 1 (I)

                                Energy Commission, to consult following this session, in order to
                                determine when there exists a basis for agreement on international
                                control of atomic energy, and thereupon to re-convene the United
                                Nations Atomic Energy Commission in order to resume its activities
                                and in any event to report the results of their consultation to the

                        </note> so that no further action was necessary. The secretary stated that
                        the Delegation would proceed on the basis outlined.</p>

                        made the strongest attack to date on the Western Powers.<note n="5"

                        position which would be recommended arose out of negotiations last summer
                        with the British and French. The British had orginally felt that there
                        should not be separate discussions on atomic energy, disarmament, and
                        Article 43 forces. The British had, however, agreed to separate the atomic
                        energy discussions and in return for this concession, Mr. Johnson believed
                        that the United States was more or less committed to support the British
                        substitute for the Vishinsky proposal (US(P) A/C.1/49/Rev. <pb n="455"

                            resolution contemplated by the British Delegation, circulated in the

                            an antecedent of the draft actually introduced by the United Kingdom on
                            October 10 (A/C.1/319); regarding that resolution, see footnote 7, <ref

                        objections. The British would take the necessary initiative.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Austin said he saw no objection to the British draft, provided
                        there was no change in the general views of the Committee. He commented
                        that, there was almost nothing in the British draft. In any event, the
                        United States position was not to encourage anything substantive under
                        present circumstances, and in particular, until the Peace Treaties had been
                        concluded, the control of atomic energy established, and the Article 43
                        Forces set up. All three things must come before the reduction of
                        conventional armaments. The Soviet proposal for a one-third reduction was,
                        of course, out of the question. Ambassador Austin referred to the speech
                        made by Vishinsky in the Committee yesterday and said he felt it had
                        automatically made everyone feel they would have to oppose the Soviet
                        proposal. After some delay in the Committee, since no one was really
                        prepared on this subject, the British representative had made an effective
                            speech.<note n="7" xml:id="d247fn7">For the record of the remarks by Sir

                        Members time to read Mr. Vishinsky’s remarks.</p>
                    <p>Ambassador Austin believed the question of strategy might become very
                        substantial in this case. It seemed to him that silence on the part of the
                        United States might be golden. The Committee would quickly proceed to a vote
                        and the British resolution would, under the rules, be voted on first, as an
                        amendment in the nature of a substitute. There would be plenty of time to
                        find out whether the Soviet resolution would be decisively defeated. He
                        thought this procedural decision was of considerable importance, and said he
                        believed it was better not to rush in but simply to go ahead with the
                        preparation of a speech and watch developments in the Committee. The
                        Secretary wondered whether there were any possibilities that the
                        developments in the Committee might catch us off guard.</p>
                    <p>Reference was made to a telegram from the Department dealing with procedure
                        in this case.<note n="9" xml:id="d247fn9">The telegram under reference has

                        circumstances in the Committee supported the strategy discussed above.</p>
                    <p>If the United States was not putting itself in a position where it might be
                        surprised by developments, the Secretary believed that Ambassador <pb
                            n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0476"/>Austin’s recommendations were
                        appropriate. He thought the Delegation should consider how the United States
                        could protect itself in this situation. Ambassador Austin proposed that the
                        United States should prepare a speech, and then simply sit and watch
                        Committee developments. He believed that the United States would be able to
                        find out through its conversations with other Delegations just what the
                        trend in the Committee would be and in that manner could guard against any
                        surprises. The Secretary then stated that he believed the procedure was
                        appropriate. Mr. Dulles agreed and pointed out that there was not any
                        particular propaganda value at the present time in seeking to encourage a
                        resolution on general disarmament. Resolutions of this kind gave rise to
                        hopes that would be thwarted. The Secretary commented that it would be most
                        gratifying if no speeches were made, and the Soviet resolution was voted
                        down. Assuming this would happen, and that the United States could be sure
                        by checking on the way Delegations would vote, he favored the course of
                        action discussed above.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Pell<note n="10" xml:id="d247fn10">Robert T. Pell, Adviser, United States
                            Delegation.</note> reported briefly on the reaction to Vishinsky’s
                        disarmament speech and said that although there was very little comment in
                        the European press, what there was was very unfavorable. For the first time
                        the French press had been most vigorous in its criticism of the language and
                        unparliamentary manner of Vishinsky. Mr. McKeever noted that this was the
                        first time that there was no great public demand for disarmament since
                        people were sophisticated as to the demands of the situation in 1948, and
                        the usual emotional drive was lacking. Mr. Dulles said he thought most
                        people would regard it as a great disaster if the United States were to
                        disarm.</p>

                        views expressed by the Canadians was that they would like to see a counter
                        resolution of some kind because of public opinion at home. It would be <pb

                        flatly the Vyshinsky proposal without some substitute.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Roger Allen</hi>. The United Kingdom Delegation feels
                        that some substitute is needed. They are not certain as to the timing of its
                        submission, or as to the timing as to when they should speak again. Earlier
                        today they thought it might be better to hold their resolution back for a
                        while but later in the day seemed to be changing their opinion in the
                        direction of putting it in early. Cadogan has a set speech which he can make
                        tomorrow if necessary, but they seemed to think it would be better not to
                        speak tomorrow. In our conversation the implication was very strong that the
                        British are anticipating full Backing and a strong, blunt speech on our
                        part. They are also not certain what the best timing would be for our
                        speech, i.e., whether it should be made, after they offer their resolution,
                        in support of it, or perhaps after Vyshinsky replies to Hector McNeil,
                        which, they thought, would probably be tomorrow.</p>

                    <p>I did not inquire directly of the Belgian Delegation, but I over-heard a
                        conversation between Rolin, of Belgium, and Jebb, of the British Delegation,
                        in which Rolin was taking the position that a good substitute resolution
                        should be introduced. He was in effect asking Jebb if the Belgians could see
                        any drafts which the British had oft this, and perhaps work together on
                        it.</p>

                        expressed the view that the best way to take care of the Vyshinsky proposal
                        would be to refer it to the Conventional Armaments Commission. After I
                        explained that this would be very undesirable, he agreed and seemed to
                        concur with the idea that a substitute resolution of some kind would be the
                        best solution. It was rather clear that the South African Delegation has not
                        considered this question.</p>

                        passed, and that the Soviet resolution should be voted down. He expressed
                        the hope that the United States Delegation would speak strongly and bluntly
                        on this subject, backing up and extending what has been said by Bevin and
                        Spaak. He feels that McNeil has not carried the argument far enough, in
                        placing emphasis on the question of safeguards and the opening up of Russia
                        to inspection. He said that someone should make it clear that even this
                        would not be enough, that we needed to be satisfied that conditions within
                        Russia in the armaments field were all right. He thought the point should be
                        made of the present imbalance of power.</p>

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Blaisdell</hi> recalled that the various proposals
                        on Atomic Energy were now in the hands of the drafting sub-committee of
                        Committee 1.<note n="1" xml:id="d251fn1">For an account of the work of the

                        on the work already accomplished by this sub-committee. Mr. Osborn explained
                        that the sub-committee had begun its work Friday.<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d251fn2">October 8.</note> By noon the next day he thought that

                        the other members of the sub-committee into a state of mind where they
                        wanted to vote as quickly as possible in favor of the majority plan.</p>
                    <p>He explained that the sub-committee was now discussing the Canadian draft
                        resolution which had been somewhat modified but which was still the agreed
                        text of France, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. He thought
                        this would require fairly lengthy consideration, particularly because the
                        USSR would try very hard to break down the resolve on the part of the
                        majority not to return to further negotiations in the Atomic Energy
                        Commission. Mr. Osborn proposed that no changes be accepted, no matter how
                        long the Committee might be deadlocked in discussion, because any further
                        changes would weaken the present resolution.</p>
                    <p>There was also the question whether some way should be left open to the USSR
                        to return to the Atomic Energy Commission without accepting its First and
                        Second Reports. <hi rend="smallcaps">Mrs. Roosevelt</hi> pointed out that,
                        if it did not accept the two reports, the USSR would not have agreed to the
                        principle of inspection.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Osborn</hi> indicated that both Australia and
                        Belgium might be difficult in the final Committee discussions. Evatt
                        (Australia) was now claiming that the United States had named the
                        sub-committee. Ambassador Austin recalled that Mr. Protitch<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d251fn4">Dragoslav Protitch, Principal Director of the
                            Department of Security Council Affairs, United Nations
                            Secretariat.</note> of the Secretariat, had shown him a list of states,
                        which Spaak intended to appoint to the subcommittee. After looking the list
                        over and handing it to his advisers, he indicated that the United States had
                        no objections. Mr. Osborn noted that Czechoslavakia had been on the original
                        list but the Ukraine had apparently been substituted at the request of the
                        USSR, showing that the subcommittee had been appointed after consultation
                        with both the United States and the USSR. Ambassador Austin inquired whether
                        Australia was simply charging that the sub-committee was subject to United
                        States domination. Mr. Osborn said Evatt claimed that the United States had
                        deliberately kept Australia off the subcommittee. Mr. Ross believed this
                        misunderstanding should be corrected firmly and immediately. It was agreed
                        that Mr. Ross should speak to Hodgson<note n="5" xml:id="d251fn5">William R.
                            Hodgson, member of the Australian Delegation; Australian Ambassador in

                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Gross</hi> asked whether Australia actually had a
                        legitimate grievance on the merits, since it had submitted a proposal, and
                        asked whether they might not still be added to the sub-committee. Mr. Raynor
                        noted that there were other states which had made proposals, who were not on
                        the sub-committee, and he thought nothing more should be done than simply
                        tell the Australians what had happened. Mr. Rusk Said he believed it was
                        important not to deny that Spaak had actually consulted with the United
                        States; otherwise he might be put in an embarrassing position.</p>

                        Committee 1. There were in the Delegation documents today the Soviet

                            draft resolution, A/C.1/319, October 10, expressed concern at the lack

                            Commission for Conventional Armaments, and the Military Staff Committee.
                            The resolution attributed this failure to the refusal of certain members
                            “to accommodate themselves to the views of the majority and to
                            co-operate or indeed to participate fully in the work of the

                            world-wide sense of insecurity. The resolution concluded by urging “all

                        strategy was to play for additional time. Ambassador Austin indicated that
                        Vyshinsky might himself ask for more time after the British resolution was
                        introduced in order to study that proposal. Mr. Popper<note n="12"
                            xml:id="d251fn12">David H. Popper, Adviser, United States

                    <p>Mr. Ross thought the situation might be eased if the sub-committee on atomic
                        energy completed its work today so that its report could come before
                        Committee 1 Tuesday. Mr. Osborn said the chairman of the sub-committee had
                        expressed a willingness to hold night meetings, and he was optimistic that
                        the sub-committee might finish at least by this evening.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Ambassador Austin</hi> asked for the views of the
                        Delegation on the substance of the position taken in the United Kingdom
                        resolution. Mr. Blaisdell pointed out that it had been carefully examined by
                        the staff and already approved by the Delegation. Moreover, the British had
                        been informed of our approval. It also appeared likely that the United
                        States could support the Syrian resolution. Ambassador Austin stated the
                        agreement of the Delegation that it would support the British and Syrian
                        drafts but would withhold comment until further instructions were received
                        from Washington.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Gross</hi> referred to the language in the
                        penultimate paragraph of the British draft resolution, “in particular the
                        principle that such regulation and reduction can only be put into effect in
                        an atmosphere of international confidence and security”. In his opinion this
                        language implied a relation between the existence of armaments and the
                        general political atmosphere. Ambassador Austin explained that the phrase
                        was intended to refer to the completion of certain preliminary conditions,
                        including the peace treaties, the establishment of a system of control of
                        atomic energy, organization of the Article 43 forces, and agreement by the
                        USSR to a system of international inspection. Mr. Blaisdell noted that the
                        idea could be traced back to the debates on this matter in the Security
                        Council and the Commission for Conventional Armaments.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Dulles</hi> noted that there were two theories on
                        disarmament. The first was to the effect that there must be established an
                        atmosphere of international confidence before disarmament could be
                        undertaken, while the second suggested that the presence of armaments
                        themselves created a lack of international confidence. In his opinion the
                        correct theory was probably a combination of both ideas. Certainly the
                        competitive arms race was a problem. He noted that there were large foodies
                        of public opinion in the United States which would consider <pb n="463"
                            xml:id="pg_463" facs="0483"/>this expression a one-sided view. He
                        pointed out that the resolution on atomic energy was utterly irreconcilable
                        with the British draft in this regard. Each took an opposite thesis and
                        overstated it.</p>

                    <p>At our request Messrs. Jebb and Allen, of the United Kingdom Delegation,
                        called at the Crillon<note n="1" xml:id="d252fn1">The Crillon was one of
                            several residence hotels of the United States Delegation and

                            >October 10.</note> to discuss this question. We explained the situation
                        in the Committee as we saw it. We said we were prepared to make a very
                        strong statement, a part of which we reviewed with them, and that we felt
                        the best possible time to make it would be after Vyshinsky replies to McNeil
                        and Shawcross.<note n="3" xml:id="d252fn3">Sir Hartley Shawcross, member of
                            the British Delegation; Attorney General of the united Kingdom.</note>
                        We said, however, that we wanted to have some counter resolution on the
                        table which we could speak for, as well as speaking for the demolition of
                        the Vyshinsky proposal. We said, therefore, we must know what the British
                        intend to do with their resolution.<note n="4" xml:id="d252fn4">For
                            information on the British draft resolution, see footnote 7, <ref

                        promise to support it, but said we were not certain it was good enough. We
                        said that, in addition to supporting the British resolution, we would also
                        favor supporting something along the line of the Syrian resolution,<note
                            n="5" xml:id="d252fn5">For information on the Syrian draft resolution on
                            disarmament, A/C.1/318, see footnote 9, <ref target="#pg_461">p.
                                461</ref>.</note> perhaps after it was merged with the British
                        proposal. We made it clear that supporting continuation of the work of the
                        Conventional Armaments Commission was United States Government policy.</p>
                    <p>The British took the view that, although they realize this is our policy,
                        pursuing it would weaken our position for suspension of the <pb n="464"
                            xml:id="pg_464" facs="0484"/>work of the Atomic Energy Commission. We
                        took the view that, on the other hand, it might well have the opposite
                        effect. We said that it was a pretty big dose of medicine for the Assembly
                        to agree to suspend either, and if there was agreement on the Conventional
                        Armaments Commission, there might be some likelihood for the New Zealand
                        consultation proposal on atomic energy<note n="6" xml:id="d252fn6">For text,
                            see footnote 8, <ref target="#pg_454">p. 454</ref>.</note> to succeed.
                        Incidentally the British, while they have not given up hope, are doubtful
                        that the New Zealand proposal will succeed.</p>
                    <p>During the conversation we stated that we were worried about the emphasis in
                        Shawcross’ speech on a census and verification of armaments, as we had been
                        in 1946. We said we were quite concerned over the Belgian resolution for the
                        same reason. Captain Smith explained our reasons in this respect in some
                        detail.</p>
                    <p>We also pointed out clearly to the British Representatives present that we
                        did not think the present British resolution was in any too salable a form,
                        and that we felt something like the Syrian resolution would need to be
                        merged with it in order to make it salable. In this connection, we showed
                        them our shortform resolution,<note n="7" xml:id="d252fn7">Reference is
                            presumably to draft resolution US(P)/A/C.1/68, October 6, which read as

                            <p>The United States Delegation had also prepared an alternative draft
                                of greater length, US(P)/A/C.1/67, October 6, the operative portion
                                of which read as follows: “[The General Assembly] calls upon the
                                members of the Security Council, and particularly those constituting
                                the minority, to accept as a basis for further negotiations the
                                principle of safeguards endorsed by the majority of the Commission
                                for Conventional Armaments which will provide such an openness of
                                information between nations in this field as will create conditions
                                of confidence necessary to establish practical steps towards the
                                reduction of armaments.”</p>
                            <p>Neither draft resolution was ever submitted. For the proposal
                                introduced by the United States in Subcommittee 12 of the First

                        </note> which we said might be more readily acceptable to the Assembly than
                        their resolution. We asked them to consider our resolution from this angle.
                        We made it clear, however, that if after consideration they still desired to
                        table their own resolution, it would have our support. We pointed out that
                        there had to be something on the table and that we would have to know by
                        nightfall whether the British were tabling theirs, because if they did not,
                        when we spoke we would probably table ours, or at a minimum, <pb n="465"

                        The British promised to let us know after discussing the question with
                        Messrs. Shawcross and Cadogan.</p>
                    <p>Early in the evening the British informed us they had decided to table their
                        resolution and that it would be before the Committee this morning.</p>
                    <p>Following the receipt of a telegram from Washington this morning,<note n="8"
                            xml:id="d252fn8">Reference is to telegram <gloss target="#t_Gadel1"

                                target="#pg_459">p. 459</ref>.</note> I sent a message to Jebb,
                        telling him we were forced to be silent today. He took this information with
                        good grace but did say he hoped this did not mean we would not be able to
                        support the British resolution which they were tabling. I also informed him
                        we couldn’t tell until the new situation was clarified during the day.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Jebb immediately suggested that the strategy, in the light of this new
                        development, should be today to stall for time. He said Sir Hartley
                        Shawcross would undoubtedly, in the light of the new situation, take such a
                        line when he spoke. It was also indicated that if Vyshinsky comes into the
                        Debate today, Sir Hartley might also speak again in rebuttal (which would be
                        the third rebuttal speech by the British as contrasted with none on our
                        part.)</p>

                                Senator Austin instead stated the following in conclusion:</p>
                            <p>“Before closing, I wish to state that the Delegation of the United
                                States has considered carefully and will vote for the resolutions
                                which have been submitted to this committee by the Delegations of
                                the United Kingdom and Syria [A/C.1/319 and A/C.1/318]. Taken
                                together these resolutions are entirely consistent with the position
                                of the United States. Article 26 of the Charter provides: ‘That— …
                                the Security Council shall be responsible for formulating … plans to
                                be submitted to the Members of the United Nations for the
                                establishment of a system for the regulation of armaments.’</p>
                            <p>“Despite the fact that the work of this Commission [the Commission
                                for Conventional Armaments] has continued to be hampered by the
                                demagogic appeals and irresponsible propaganda of the Soviet Union,
                                the United States believes that the commission must proceed with its
                                work.”</p>

                    <p>Turning first to atomic energy, Mr. Osborn explained that a subcommittee,
                        constituted to consider the various proposals submitted in the course of the
                        general debate on atomic energy in Committee 1, had met for five days and
                        found no compromise possible. It had agreed to submit three different
                        resolutions to the main Committee. The first was the Canadian resolution,
                        which followed the position of the US in every detail. The second was a
                        resolution submitted by India, which actually combined the Syrian and
                        Australian proposals, <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0488"/>which Indian
                        resolution was unacceptable to the US. The third was the Soviet
                            resolution.<note n="1" xml:id="d255fn1">For information regarding the
                            work of the subcommittee and the proposals under its consideration, see
                            editorial note, <ref target="#pg_473">p. 473</ref>.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>In his view, the most important aspect of the work of the sub-committee was
                        the discovery that, although it had originally been thought that the USSR
                        had actually offered a compromise in the field of the control of atomic
                        energy, it had turned out to be a shrewd maneuver which would have meant
                        that the Atomic Energy Commission would return to work under two conditions:
                        (1) the US would have to agree to the simultaneous conclusion of two
                        conventions, one on prohibition and one on control of atomic energy; and (2)
                        the Atomic Energy Commission would resume work on the basis of the Soviet
                        interpretation of the January 24, 1946 Assembly resolution. This latter
                        point meant to the USSR that the idea of stages which had been included by
                        the Assembly in that resolution was simply set forth as a method of study
                        for the Atomic Energy Commission and not, as the US interpreted the
                        resolution, as a stage-by-stage transition to a system of control. Mr.
                        Osborn explained that the Soviet position would mean that the US would have
                        to destroy its atomic weapons and that then there would be a period of from
                        six months to a year during which the actual system would be setup, at the
                        end of which time the USSR might indicate its disagreement with the entire
                        system. In other words, in his view, the Soviet proposal was nothing more
                        than a move which would force the US to cease negotiations on atomic energy,
                        since the US offer to give up its atomic weapons was based on the
                        establishment of an effective, enforceable control system. The Soviet
                        position would have called for a resolution to the contrary effect by the
                        General Assembly. He believed it was important to maintain a firm
                        uncompromising position on this matter in line with the Canadian
                        resolution.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Blaisdell explained that the other subject which had been considered by
                        Committee 1 was the Soviet proposal on disarmament. The general debate had
                        been concluded at noon yesterday, and a sub-committee had been established
                        to work over the various resolutions which had been submitted to the
                            Committee.<note n="2" xml:id="d255fn2">Reference is to Subcommittee 12,

                        with Mr. Langenhove. The conversation with Mr. Parodi on the other hand took
                        place just before the start of the Committee I session and in view of the
                        lack of time it was only possible to stress our position in general

                                out that any census of troops and its verification constitute
                                substantive steps which should fall within the purview of the <gloss

                        the situation created by the General Assembly resolutions of 24 January and
                        14 December 1946, which had not yet been implemented. The USSR delegation
                        had repeatedly stated his views as to the reasons why those resolutions had
                        not been carried out. Not only had the Commission for Conventional Armaments
                        taken no practical steps towards proposing practical measures for the
                        regulation and reduction of armaments and armed forces but it had adopted a
                        joint United States and United Kingdom resolution<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d257fn2">Reference is presumably to the resolution on Item 2 of
                            the <gloss target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss> Plan of Work (Principles)

                        interpreted by public opinion both in the United States and throughout the
                        world as meaning that the idea of disarmament had been practically buried by
                        the United Nations. In fact, two days after that resolution had been passed
                        stating that no disarmament was possible until a series of prerequisites had
                        been fulfilled, the United States Cable Bureau [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]
                        had announced that the United Nations had, in effect, failed in its three
                        year old efforts to attain world disarmament. The USSR draft resolution took
                        that fact as its point of departure in noting that practically nothing had
                        been done to influence the General Assembly resolutions. The second point of
                        the USSR draft resolution aimed at pointing out that the prohibition of the
                        production and use of atomic energy for war is of the first importance.
                        Thereafter, it noted that a general reduction of armaments would assist in
                        establishing a durable peace, would strengthen international security and
                        was in the interests of nations which sought to ease the heavy economic
                        burden resulting from ever-increasing expenditure on armaments.</p>
                    <p>The draft resolution based itself on concrete reality in making the practical
                        proposal that the five Great Powers, the permanent members of the Security
                        Council, which bore the main responsibility for the maintenance of peace and
                        international security and which possessed an overwhelming share of the
                        armaments of the world, should take a first step of agreeing to reduce their
                        existing land, naval and air forces by one third within a period of a
                        year.</p>
                    <p>The second important step proposed was based upon the fact that no real
                        reduction of armaments was possible without the prohibition of atomic
                        weapons. The USSR delegation therefore proposed that atomic weapons be
                        prohibited as weapons capable only of being used for aggression and not for
                        defence.</p>
                    <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0492"/>
                    <p>The third point of the draft resolution was the establishment, within the
                        framework of the Security Council, of an international control organ to
                        supervise the carrying out of the measures proposed. These essential points
                        were submitted for definite decision by the Sub-Committee.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Osborn</hi> (United States) examined the draft
                        resolution paragraph by paragraph.</p>
                    <p>The first paragraph was unacceptable because a majority of nine members in
                        both the Atomic Energy Commission and the Commission for Conventional
                        Armaments considered the statement incorrect. The plan and proposals
                        developed by the Atomic Energy Commission and now before the General
                        Assembly constituted one of the finest pieces of treaty drafting
                        accomplished in the United Nations. Sub-Committee 11 [<hi rend="italic"
                            >111</hi>] had already agreed that the proposals were very important and
                        should be voted upon. No concrete accomplishments could be recorded because
                        two representatives had refused to accept any of the principles deemed
                        necessary by the majority.</p>
                    <p>The Commission for Conventional Armaments also had worked very hard. Nine
                        members had agreed upon the general principles which should govern the
                        regulation and reduction of armaments and armed forces but those principles
                        had been rejected in toto by two members. Mr. Osborn emphasized particularly
                        the rejection by the USSR of the principle of safeguards and its refusal to
                        recognize that the conditions of world security had anything to do with
                        disarmament. Consequently the first paragraph of the USSR draft resolution
                        was without foundation.</p>
                    <p>The second paragraph might be dismissed for a great number of reasons but the
                        simplest reason was that the question of the prohibition and control of
                        atomic energy was being dealt with by another organ of the United
                        Nations.</p>
                    <p>The third paragraph would be acceptable only if it provided for a guarantee
                        that no nation was arming in secret behind an “iron curtain”.</p>
                    <p>The next two paragraphs were not of particular importance but Mr. Osborn
                        thought that the second of the two should specifically name the
                        expansionists and reactionary elements referred to. It should state what
                        nations had, after the end of the war, seized territory which had never
                        belonged to them. The question would then be whether a reactionary
                        government was one responsible to the people who elected them or one run by
                        an iron military dictatorship.</p>
                    <p>The sixth paragraph, Mr. Osborn found astonishing. He recalled that the USSR
                        representative had objected bitterly to the first paragraph of the
                        resolution adopted by the Commission for Conventional Armaments stating that
                        any system for the regulation and reduction <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473"
                            facs="0493"/>of armaments and armed forces must initially include all
                        States having “substantial military resources”. The USSR representative had
                        opposed that principle as somehow a trick. Yet he now proposed to limit
                        disarmament to the permanent members of the Security Council. Mr. Osborn
                        could not accept the paragraph until the USSR representative had withdrawn
                        his earlier statement of views to the Commission for Conventional Armaments
                        or explained his change of views. Mr. Osborn could not take seriously, and
                        almost every speaker in the Political Committee had taken the same view, a
                        proposal for arms reduction made by a country which closed its frontiers to
                        any possibility of control or verification. Had it been accompanied by a
                        scheme for continuing verification he could have view[ed] it as made in good
                        faith, though still looking on it as mistaken in method. Unless so
                        accompanied, however, it had no meaning. The penultimate paragraph dealing
                        with atomic energy had no place in the resolution.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the final paragraph Mr. Osborn stated that it provided for a body
                        to perform the same function in planning for a control body as had been
                        entrusted to the Commission for Conventional Armaments. That Commission,
                        after serious study, had produced a short list of general principles which
                        had been rejected by the USSR.</p>
                    <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>He asked the representative of the USSR whether his Government would
                        demonstrate its willingness to abandon its expansionist drive by withdrawing
                        its fifth column from other States. Would it give up its veto over
                        verification, inspection, and control. Was it prepared to open its frontiers
                        so that the peoples of other nations might know what was going on and be
                        relieved of the fear that activities behind the “iron curtain” made it
                        necessary for them to arm? Mr. Osborn believed that every paragraph of the
                        USSR draft resolution was intentionally framed to confuse the public mind
                        and hide the fact that the USSR did not want others to know what armaments
                        it was producing. He asked whether it was not a piece of effrontery for such
                        a proposal as he had described to be submitted by a dictatorship, the most
                        reactionary government in the world to-day, such as Generalissimo Stalin
                        himself had described as “unlimited power resting upon violence and not upon
                        law”.</p>

                    <p>The First Committee, at its 153rd Meeting, October 7, established
                        Subcommittee A.III to consider proposals on atomic energy before the
                        Committee and to reach agreement on a draft resolution for submission <pb
                            n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0494"/>to the Committee. Subcommittee
                        A.III formally approved its report, A/C.1/333, on October 15; for text, see

                    <p>The Subcommittee Report contained the texts of the three resolutions upon
                        which votes were taken. Canadian resolution A/C.1/A.III/1/Rev. 3 received
                        eight affirmative votes (Brazil, Canada, China, Ecuador, France, Sweden, the
                        United Kingdom, and the United States); there were two votes against (the
                        Soviet Union and the Ukraine) and one abstention (India). This draft
                        resolution consisted of the original Canadian text (A/C.1/308) modified by
                        substantive suggestions by New Zealand, France, and Ecuador and amended by
                        Canada itself. It provided for General Assembly approval of the

                        Second Report, expressed concern regarding the impasse noted in the Third
                        Report, and requested the six permanent members of the <gloss

                        whether there existed a basis for the resumption of the activities of the
                        Commission.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet draft resolution, A/C.1/310 (for text, see footnote 1, <ref
                            target="#pg_445">page 445</ref>), received two affirmative votes in the
                        Subcommittee (the Soviet Union and the Ukraine), and seven negative votes
                        (Brazil, Canada, China, France, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United
                        States). India and Ecuador abstained.</p>
                    <p>An Indian resolution, A/C.1/A.III/4/Rev. 2, approved the findings,
                        recommendations, and specific proposals of the first two reports of the
                            <gloss target="#t_UNAEC1">UNAEC</gloss>. However, unlike the Canadian
                        resolution, it called upon the Commission to resume its work.
                        A/C.1/A.III/4/Rev. 2 received the vote of its sponsor; four votes were cast
                        against it (Canada, Brazil, Sweden, and the United States). There were six

                        be crucial ones as regarded action on atomic energy. During this period,
                        Committee <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0495"/>1 would have to vote on
                        the Soviet resolution, the Canadian resolution (which was completely
                        consistent with US policy), and the Indian resolution.<note n="1"

                        substantial majority of the Members favored consultation among the
                        sponsoring powers on atomic energy, though there was some question in his
                        own mind as to whether a two-thirds majority was agreed on this point. He
                        had found that the most useful and convincing argument in support of the US
                        position for consultation was to the effect that, until the basic problem of
                        what the Soviets really desire, and what their security requirements are, is
                        solved, it will be quite impossible to solve any individual problems arising
                        between the USSR and the United States. The Canadian resolution asked the
                        sponsoring Powers to consult as to the factors in this situation which had
                        brought about the present impasse. This question afforded, he felt, an
                        opportunity for natural discussion. In his view this sort of broad
                        consultation was the only kind which might accomplish results. Ambassador
                        Austin called attention to the interpretation given by General McNaughton of
                        the phrase “higher level” in connection with the consultations. Such
                        consultation appeared to mean Foreign Ministers although he noted that the
                        resolution, since it requested a report back to the United Nations,
                        indicated that such consultation should go on within the framework of the
                        United Nations. Mr. Dulles asked whether the Canadian resolution would
                        exclude consultation on less than the “higher level.” Mr. Osborn explained
                        that it would not prevent informal conversations with the U.S.S.R. but these
                        would not be official since the resolution required consultation with all
                        six sponsoring powers. Mr. Dulles expressed some doubt as to whether such
                        talks on a six-power basis would be effective.</p>

                        proposal by submitting amendments which would be unacceptable to the USSR.
                        He did not believe the United States should view these proposals in such a
                        petty way and recommended that it should make clear its opposition to the
                        Soviet proposal by voting against it. He recognized, however, that the
                        French domestic situation <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0496"/>made the

                        noted that for somewhat related reasons it might also be necessary for the
                        United Kingdom to abstain on the vote on the Soviet resolution. He thought
                        it was desirable to put the question of this approach directly before the
                        Delegation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Ross</hi> asked why the United Kingdom would
                        abstain. Mr. Osborn explained that presumably because of British public
                        opinion, the British representative was recommending that the British
                        resolution itself be submitted as an amendment to the Soviet proposal. Mr.
                        Ross commented that he understood that Mr. Bevin felt very strongly that it
                        was essential not “to kid people along” on disarmament. If this were true, a
                        British abstention would not be in line. Ambassador Austin noted that the
                        British position, like our own, was tied to the establishment of an
                        effective control system for atomic energy and conventional armaments, and
                        the organization of Article 43 Forces. He pointed out, however, that the
                        British, along with many other Delegations were somewhat upset when they
                        learned that the United States would not join in an amendment to the Soviet
                        resolution.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Dulles</hi> said it seemed to him that the
                        international situation was such that it would be very dangerous to keep
                        alive the belief that there could be any reduction of armaments. The
                        practical situation should be remembered. In the present political situation
                        the one thing which most of these countries wished and which made them feel
                        safe was armaments. The Soviet Union had so frightened people all over the
                        world that the only reassuring policy was an increase in their armaments. He
                        thought that to keep alive the idea that there could be anything
                        constructive done on disarmament at this time was simply playing the Soviet
                        game. Mr. Ross agreed and said he understood that the basis for Mr. Bevin’s
                        position was his profound conviction that the United Kingdom must rearm. Mr.
                        Osborn pointed out that the United Kingdom and the United States both felt
                        that there could be no disarmament without basic agreement on various
                        political issues.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mrs. Roosevelt</hi> did not think that it was possible
                        to get this idea across to the people. In her opinion it was foolish to
                        believe that the people, either in the United Kingdom, the United States, or
                        any other country, are not affected by a suggestion for disarmament. She
                        pointed out that unless they could be made to understand the willingness of
                        the United States to disarm under certain conditions, there would be
                        tremendous opposition to the present United States position. She commented
                        that she had already received resolutions adopted by women’s groups and
                        church groups supporting a reduction in armaments. She thought this program
                        must be clarified for the people in very simple <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477"
                            facs="0497"/>terms because on the surface, it looked as if the United
                        States wanted to keep countries armed and was refusing every conciliatory
                        gesture. The United States position was clear to her, but it was evident
                        from her correspondence that it was not understood by most people.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Ambassador Austin</hi> pointed out that the United
                        States had tried to work out a common approach with the British immediately
                        after Vishinsky proposed this item for the agenda. We had tried to urge an
                        approach which would treat Vishinsky’s speech as a dud by refusing to debate
                        it and simply letting it be voted down. Ambassador Austin said he had talked
                        with Messrs. McNeil and Jebb of the United Kingdom Delegation who disagreed
                        entirely, arguing it was necessary to introduce a counter resolution. Since
                        the other Great Powers took a similar position, the United States could do
                        nothing alone. He said various Latin American Delegates however, had come to
                        him personally and indicated that they would have supported a course of no
                        discussion and no action on the Vishinsky proposal. The ensuing debate in
                        Committee 1 had simply confused the Members. The United States had submitted
                        no resolution and no amendments, and was simply going to support the United
                        Kingdom proposal.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Ambassador Corrigan</hi> wondered if it might not be a
                        good idea, at least from a propaganda point of view, for the United States
                        simply to propose a 50 percent reduction of armaments since it was certain
                        that that would never be accepted. It was noted that this was the same
                        argument as that of the French whose particular domestic political problems
                        it reflected accurately. The United States certainly had no similar reasons
                        for this approach. Mrs. Roosevelt commented that the menace of the Communist
                        Party in such states as France was responsible for this equivocal position.
                        Mr. Dulles pointed out that the Communists were saying that they would not
                        fight if these states were invaded by the Red Army, and since the domestic
                        Communists would be put in power by a Soviet invasion, the present leaders
                        were interested in providing future protection for themselves in the event
                        of a Communist coup. Actually, this approach played directly into the hands
                        of the Communists.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Cohen</hi> said he believed that what was lacking
                        was an affirmative proposal which met some of the more real issues of the
                        times so that the United States would not seem to be opposing something, the
                        very distant, long-run objectives of which it favored. He said he did not
                        know whether it was too late to prepare a resolution deploring the bi-polar
                        nature of power in the world, recognizing the desirability of greater
                        interdependence and getting agreement on the Western European Union and
                        European Recovery Program all of which would lead to progressive disarmament
                        and peace. He believed that so long as this <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478"
                            facs="0498"/>Government was on the defensive it would suffer great
                        difficulties because no matter how it was dealt with, there was such wide
                        favor for disarmament as an ideal. He was doubtful whether anything
                        constructive was done simply by rejecting amendments.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Rusk</hi> said that the United States position on
                        disarmament had been based upon several related ideas. First, the Security
                        Council had the primary responsibility in the field of disarmament—not the
                        General Assembly. Second, the United States should not favor discontinuing
                        the Commission for Conventional Armaments, and thus appear to close the door
                        to agreement. Third, it was felt that the Commission on Conventional
                        Armaments could continue to do useful work, particularly, study the problem
                        of safeguards in the field of conventional armaments, as the Atomic Energy
                        Commission had done for atomic energy. It was obviously undesirable to
                        suspend the work of the Commission.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Osborn</hi>, replying to Mr. Cohen’s remarks, said
                        that he had tried to draft a resolution along the lines suggested by Mr.
                        Cohen which would make the basic issues clear and put the Soviet
                        intransigeant position in proper perspective. Because this idea had not
                        obtained much support, the United States had dropped back to the United
                        Kingdom resolution even though it lacked desired simplicity. Ambassador
                        Austin read the British resolution for the information of the Delegation.
                        Asked by Mr. Dulles whether it was supported by the other Great Powers, Mr.
                        Osborn said it was supported only by the United Kingdom and Canada. He noted
                        that it obviously lacked appeal and simplicity. Mr. Cohen said he thought
                        the resolution did little more than blame the Soviet Union for the present
                        situation. Mr. Dulles thought the resolution had intrinsic merit but
                        considerable background was required for anyone to understand what it meant.
                        Mr. Osborn believed the text reflected the fact that this subject had been
                        handled at too low a level in the United Kingdom. Mr. Cohen pointed out that
                        this was such a short summary of the situation that it would not have any
                        appeal comparable to that of the Vyshinsky proposal. Mr. Rusk suggested it
                        might be desirable to attach to the British resolution, as an annex, the
                            <gloss target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss> agreed statement of principles.<note

                        Mr. Cohen thought it was important to find some way of dramatizing the
                        resolution. Mrs. Roosevelt said she could not help feeling that the United
                        States should make a dramatic speech in favor of disarmament which would
                        show that the Soviet offer to disarm, however, meant nothing unless it was
                        implemented by certain definite things, and indicating that the USSR has not
                        been willing to take even the first step preliminary to agreement <pb
                            n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0499"/>on disarmament. The British
                        resolution was a statement of the facts and was understandable only if one
                        knew everything that had gone before. Mr. Rusk suggested that it might be
                        appropriate to ask Mr. Cohen to draft some additional clauses which the
                        United States could suggest to the British for inclusion in their
                        resolution.</p>

                        The author apparently argued that the USSR should not accept the control
                        system because opposition from other countries would prevent it from
                        developing its own atomic energy program to meet its needs.</p>

                        which might be added to the British resolution on conventional armaments.
                        The purpose of the amendments would be to bring out the fact that the Soviet
                        proposal is pure propaganda, that the program mapped out by the Commission
                        for Conventional Armaments has been stopped by the USSR and that in the
                        present condition of the world today, projects for peace like disarmament
                        cannot be worked out until other issues are first settled. Ambassador Austin
                        also stated the agreement of the Delegation to the present United States
                        position of firm opposition to the French and Belgian amendments to the

                    <p>SS–3. Spaak believes that temper of Committee 1 is such that the Australian
                        proposal will have strong support and, while it may not get a majority, will
                        almost certainly result in our failure to get a two thirds majority for the
                        straight Canadian resolution and may even result in abstentions to extent
                        that we might fail to get two thirds for approval of proposals.</p>
                    <p>SS–4. MacNaughton concurs with Spaak’s views but says Australian amendment in
                        its present form is of course impossible of acceptance and we would have to
                        fight it even at risk of losing our two thirds or even losing majority.
                        MacNaughton has therefore proposed to Evatt, without our concurrence, that
                        they accept instead the following final paragraph to be added to the
                        Canadian resolution; which would become a complete substitute for the new
                        third paragraph proposed by the Australians:</p>

                    <p>SS–5. MacNaughton has just this minute seen Hodgson of Australia. MacNaughton
                        reports that Australia will accept Canadian compromise given in paragraph 4
                        above. He also tells us that Canadian delegation must go ahead in any event
                        on that basis, on instructions from their highest level, which we assume
                        means MacKenzie <pb n="481" xml:id="pg_481" facs="0501"/>King; MacNaughton
                        says he is convinced that this is a very wise thing to do and that it will
                        mean a difference of 20 votes. He urges us to accept on ground that other
                        members of Assembly need more time to think over the basic issues involved.
                        He says in spite of our best efforts other members do not yet understand the
                        basic issue, that Russians have played very skillfully upon natural desire
                        of other delegations to keep something going on this subject. He says the
                        resulting resolution would provide six sponsoring powers with opportunity to
                        seek political basis for eventual control system through consultations, in
                        meantime Atomic Energy Commission could review its program. Determine if
                        there “are any odd subjects” which it could take up, and thereby afford
                        members of <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> a further opportunity to give
                        more information to the world about what is really involved.</p>

                    <p>SS–6. Problem is our position Tuesday afternoon<note n="6" xml:id="d260fn6"
                            >October 19.</note> when resolution and amendments will come to vote. We
                        are entirely clear that our basic position means that we must oppose
                        Australian amendment by every possible effort, regardless of voting
                        situation or any political repercussions therefrom. Big problem is posed by
                        Canadian compromise which has now been accepted by Australians. Osborn’s
                        estimate is that great majority of States who have served on <gloss
                            target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> will support Canadian compromise and he is
                        confident only of Brazilian support from that group. Big risk in our making
                        an isolated last-ditch stand on this point is that we would appear to lend
                        substance to Soviet charge that we are in fact trying to withdraw our offer
                        and that we have not meant what we said in our proposals anyhow. Since this
                        is first major item to come to head in this Assembly, political effect on
                        other important questions is most serious. An immediate adverse effect will
                        be felt in Security Council on Berlin issue where our entire effort has been
                        to stiffen timorous members, including French, who are particularly
                        responsive to propaganda suggestions that the United States is forcing issue
                        to showdown on every question at issue with Soviet Union. UP despatch
                        concerning alleged “GO-Political military plan” of Secretary Marshall for
                        intensification of cold war versus Russia has been widely featured in French
                        afternoon press.</p>

                        attitude political mood at this time. We are also informed that Latin
                        American support for our position will be very doubtful if we fail to accept
                        Canadian compromise. These considerations do not of course weigh
                        conclusively against any real possibility that Canadian compromise would
                        endanger any security interest in atomic matters. We see no such danger from
                        here but would like urgently your opinion on this aspect. Bohlen, <pb
                            n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0502"/>Osborn, Rusk, and Hewitt concur in
                        foregoing. Admiral Hewitt desires that Secretary Defense be immediately
                        informed this situation.</p>
                    <p>SS–8. Matter was discussed briefly with Dulles today who expressed opinion he
                        had always been in favor of completion of treaty—which of course we could
                        not support. Senator Austin believes we should accept Canadian
                        compromise.</p>
                    <p>SS–9. This must be settled tonight Washington time. We shall stand by for
                        reaction.</p>
                    <p>SS–10. MacNaughton assures us that under his compromise resolution Atomic
                        Energy Commission would find after relatively few meetings that Russian
                        position made further studies on the program of work to be neither practical
                        nor useful and would again cease its activities leaving to sponsoring powers
                        to find if any basis of agreement exists. Osborn concurs this view and
                        believes Soviet propaganda position would be poor. Believe Hodgson has in
                        mind completing staffing and organization but would be willing to quit after
                        that.</p>

                    <p>SS–1. Department strongly supports opposition to Australian amendment.
                        Department considers that Canadian compromise suffers, to a somewhat lesser
                        extent, from the same defects as Australian. One—It is contrary to firm
                        analysis of situation contained in Third Report. Two—It is contrary to
                        conclusion of Third Report that work on remaining topics, would serve no
                        useful purpose in view of impasse.</p>
                    <p>The Department believed that net effect of reconvening <gloss
                            target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> under Canadian amendment would again result
                        in a reaffirmation of conclusions of Third Report. But Department doubts
                        therefore that <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> should hold out the false

                    <p>Department recommends that US take every possible measure to secure

                        Canadian proposal by the addition of a paragraph calling upon the Atomic
                        Energy Commission “to resume and continue its work, to proceed with the
                        study of all the matters within its terms of reference, and to prepare for
                        submission to the Security Council as early as possible a draft treaty or
                        convention incorporating the Commission’s ultimate proposals.” He explained
                        that it was impossible for the United States Delegation to accept this
                        amendment under existing instructions since it required the completion of a
                        treaty. It was his view that since the U.S.S.R. would not agree to a treaty,
                        the result would simply be to widen the present breach. Ambassador Austin
                        pointed out that because of its special position, the United States would be
                        expected to come forward with a draft treaty. Mr. Osborn agreed, commenting
                        that any treaty to which the United States could agree under present
                        circumstances, would be so “tough” that it would certainly have little
                        chance of winning general support.</p>
                    <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0505"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Osborn</hi> explained that General McNaughton had
                        now proposed a change in the Australian amendment, to which the Australians
                        had agreed, which reversed the order of the last two paragraphs of the
                        Australian proposal, and, most important, deleted the reference to the
                        conclusion of a treaty. The change which McNaughton proposed was simply to
                        call upon the Atomic Energy Commission “to resume its sessions, to review
                        its program of work, and to proceed to the further study of such of the
                        subjects remaining in the program of work which it considers to be practical
                        and useful.” Mr. Osborn pointed out that the Commission might, for example,
                        be expected to do some useful work on matters involving staffing and
                        organization of an international control agency. Then when such studies were
                        concluded, the situation, for lack of basic agreement, would be identical to
                        the present one and the sponsoring powers would, under the resolution, be
                        required to consult. While Mr. Osborn did not regard the Australian
                        amendment as modified by Canada as altogether acceptable, there was really
                        no alternative since it was impossible to obtain a two-thirds majority for
                        complete suspension.</p>
                    <p>It was noted that Messrs Ramadier and Spaak both believed that the only way
                        to assure approval of the principles of the first, second and third reports
                        of the Atomic Energy Commission was to support this revised
                        Canadian-Australian proposal. Mr. Osborn felt a two-thirds majority was
                        practically insured. It was explained that this situation had been discussed
                        with the Department by teletype last night. The Department had agreed that
                        the United States should support this resolution and saw no possibility of
                        its endangering American security. The United States Delegation, in
                        supporting the resolution, should make clear its belief that there was
                        little hope of progress in the field of atomic energy control until the
                        U.S.S.R. altered its present policy. As a matter of fact, Mr. Osborn thought
                        there was no alternative to acceptance of this new text since Canada, United
                        Kingdom, Belgium and France had all deserted the United States.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Ambassador Austin</hi> commented that the position of
                        Belgium, France and Canada on this matter had come as a surprise and was
                        most disappointing. He had argued the United States position with
                        representatives of these states without success. These representatives took
                        the view that the clause in the resolution continuing the Commission was
                        essential if a large majority were to be obtained for the principles in the
                        three reports of the Atomic Energy Commission. This argument, together with
                        the fact that votes were slowly slipping away from the United States
                        position, had forced the change of position.</p>
                    <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0506"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Cohen</hi> asked whether it would be practical to
                        have the Canadian amendment changed slightly in order to clarify our own
                        position. He suggested that paragraph four might be altered to read
                        “remaining in the program of work as to which it is found that sufficient
                        agreement exists as to make further study practical and useful.” He
                        questioned whether the resolution got across the idea that the United States
                        objection was not to further quiet exploration in the field of atomic energy
                        control, but its belief and fear that the only result of the repetition of
                        the old positions of all the members would be to make the situation and the
                        hope of progress worse and not better. In other words, the United States
                        considered that the Atomic Energy Commission had reached the point where
                        further meetings would actually widen the breach qualitatively, if not
                        quantitatively. His suggested change developed this point of view.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Dulles</hi> thought that Mr. Cohen’s amendment
                        improved the resolution but reopened the controversy in the Committee since,
                        although the United States believed that the existing situation made further
                        work impossible, other states did not concur in this view. He feared that if
                        the United States proposed such a change the Committee would be likely to
                        get off the track a second time. As the resolution stood, it was not
                        particularly bad, and it would be no misfortune if the present text were
                        adopted. Mr. Osborn agreed, pointing out that consideration also should be
                        given to the fact that the Indian-Syrian resolution<note n="3"
                            xml:id="d262fn3">Reference is to Indian proposal A/C.1/A.III/4/Rev. 2;
                            for information on that draft, see editorial note, <ref target="#pg_473"
                                >p. 473</ref>. This Indian proposal included the suggestion embodied
                            in Syrian amendment A/C.1/309 (for text, see <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss> (III/1), <hi rend="italic">First Committee,
                            Annexes</hi>, pp. 4–5) that the Atomic Energy Commission prepare a draft
                            treaty for international control.</note> was still before the Committee.
                        He thought it was desirable to retain somewhat equivocal language,
                        particularly because it might be acceptable to the Syrians. Mr. Cohen said
                        he had not meant that the present text was unsatisfactory. He was simply
                        trying to clarify the basis for the United States position—not that it did
                        not want agreement but that it believed further discussions at this time
                        would make future progress more difficult. Mr. Rusk thought Mr. Cohen’s
                        point should be incorporated in Ambassador Austin’s speech and commented
                        that his idea was one which the Department considered important.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Ambassador Austin</hi> thereupon stated that the
                        Delegation was unanimously agreed upon the Australian amendment to the
                        Canadian resolution as further modified by the Canadians.</p>

                    <p>At the 164th Meeting of the First Committee, October 19, 3 p. m., the
                        Canadian Delegation agreed to amend its draft resolution, A/C.1/A.III/1/Rev.
                        3 (that approved by Subcommittee III). The modification consisted of the
                        addition of the following sentence: “Meanwhile the General Assembly calls
                        upon the Atomic Energy Commission to resume its sessions, to survey its
                        programme of work, and to proceed to the further study of such of the
                        subjects remaining in the programme of work as it considers to be
                        practicable and useful.” This augmented draft, circulated as A/C.1/340, was
                        ultimately approved by the General Assembly; for text, see <ref
                            target="#pg_495">page 495</ref>.</p>
                    <p>Later in the meeting, Ambassador Austin delivered a statement which was
                        recorded as follows: “Mr. Austin (United States of America) stated that his
                        delegation would accept the revised Canadian resolution but wished it clear
                        that it still adhered to the principles and policies which the delegation
                        had advocated throughout the debate. His delegation was firmly convinced
                        that the Third Report of the Commission was correct in stating that no
                        useful purpose could be served by carrying on negotiations at the Commission
                        level since the failure to achieve agreement arose from a situation beyond
                        its competence. The Commission had found the deep-seated political division
                        separating the Eastern Powers from the Western Powers a constant barrier to
                        agreement and had therefore recommended, not an indefinite suspension as
                        Colonel Hodgson had considered, but a suspension until such a time as the
                        Assembly found that the present situation no longer existed, or until the
                        six permanent members of the Commission found, through prior consultation,
                        that a basis for agreement existed.</p>
                    <p>“However, the United States had given attention to the anxiety expressed in
                        the Committee that the question of international control was being set
                        aside. While still believing firmly that a solution could come only on a
                        higher level, it would agree with the feelings of the Committee. As evidence
                        that the United States did not try to force its opinion on others, it was
                        going to vote for the Canadian draft resolution. But he thought it would be
                        the gravest error to merge again the question of the control of atomic
                        energy with the regulation and reduction of conventional armaments after
                        they had been separated by the Security Council in February 1947 after a
                        long debate. The General Assembly must use its moral power in support of the
                        work of the Atomic Energy Commission where a small minority had persistently
                        resisted a decision of the Commission. He objected to weakening the
                        resolution by adding the words ‘in principle’ or ‘substance’ in the first
                            <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0508"/>paragraph. He repeated that his
                        delegation would give its support to the Canadian draft resolution provided
                        it were not mangled by amendments.” For the full record of the 164th Meeting

                        and charged with having had the wool pulled over his eyes by the Canadians.
                        Incidentally, the Canadians also came in for some censure from the U.K.
                        because of their failure to inform the U.K. promptly of the new

                        a draft disarmament resolution had been delayed because of the negotiations
                        on atomic energy. The United States had been attempting to find an
                        acceptable formula in consultation with the British, French, and Belgian
                        representatives.</p>
                    <p>He noted that M. Rolin of Belgium had some ideas on publishing information on
                        armaments as a preliminary measure.<note n="1" xml:id="d265fn1">For text of

                                target="#pg_469">p. 469</ref>.</note> He stated that the United
                        States could not accept a simple reporting system which would include atomic
                        energy, unless there were an accompanying system of control and
                        verification. Nevertheless, the Belgian proposal held a good deal of popular
                        appeal. A resolution had been worked out under which the Belgian proposal
                        for a preliminary filing of advance information would be included in the
                        plan for additional safeguards. The Delegation had before it a French draft
                        resolution (US(P)/A/C.1/151)<note n="2" xml:id="d265fn2">US(P)A/C.1/151, not

                            Hewitt below did not appear in A/C.1/<gloss target="#t_SC1"
                            >SC</gloss>.12/1.</note> which he believed was as good as anything which
                        could be worked out in the time available. Our policy required a generally
                        fixed position within which it had been necessary to work out an acceptable
                        text.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">The Secretary</hi> asked for the comments of the
                        Delegation on the draft resolution. Admiral Hewitt said that, from the
                        military point of view, it seemed to embody all the prerequisites to
                        disarmament which were of special importance. In this connection, he called
                        particular attention to the following clauses of the preamble of the
                        resolution: “<hi rend="italic">Affirms</hi> that this aim can only be
                        attained in an atmosphere of real and lasting improvement in international
                        relations, which improvement will permit the organization of peace in an

                    <p>“<hi rend="italic">Believes</hi> that the indispensable prerequisite of
                        regulation of conventional armaments is exact knowledge of their state in
                        the various countries, and that to this end, detailed reports must be
                        received, verified and published by an international control
                        organization;”.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Gross</hi> inquired what the meaning of the word
                        “stage” was in the second paragraph of the operative part of the resolution,
                        which stated in part, “requests the Security Council to develop through the
                        Commission for Conventional Armaments as a <hi rend="italic">stage</hi> in
                        its system of safeguards a plan for the receipt verification and publication
                        … of information on armaments …” Mr. Osborn explained that it meant that a
                        plan to receive such information would be a part of the total work program
                        of the Commission for Conventional Armaments. He noted that the Commission
                        for Conventional Armaments was now working on this particular item as part
                        of its overall planning. This clause was simply an instruction to the
                        Commission for Conventional Armaments to include in the safeguards not only
                        the results of inspection and control but a preliminary stage of information
                        which would be used as a basis for determining the reduction of armaments.
                        Ambassador Austin commented that the difficulty was that “stage” had gotten
                        a conventional meaning in connection with atomic energy. Mr. Osborn pointed
                        out that it had the same meaning in this case in that the first stage was to
                        obtain armaments information and then plan reduction.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Dulles</hi> referred to Paragraph 1 of the
                        operative part of the resolution and said that he disliked somewhat the
                        phrase “progressive reduction of armaments.” As a matter of fact, it was
                        actually necessary to build up armaments in some cases because of a great
                        unbalance or vacuum of power, which needed to be filled up by power. He
                        pointed out that the Charter speaks of “reduction of armaments,” and he
                        wondered whether that phrase might not be used. Mr. Osborn said he would try
                        to have this phrase changed in Paragraph 1 but thought that in Paragraph 2
                        the reference to “the reduction to be required to each nation” would
                        probably have to remain.</p>
                    <p>Discussion disclosed that this language in the second paragraph was not
                        satisfactory. Mr. Sandifer suggested the possibility of using the word
                        “level” but the Secretary pointed out that this might be interpreted to mean
                        even armaments.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Blaisdell</hi> referred back to the preamble and
                        suggested that the phrase “regulation of armaments” should be used instead
                        of the phrase “limitation of armaments” in the statement in the preamble
                        which read <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0511"/>“declares that the
                        limitation of armaments is a fundamental aim of the United Nations”. Mr.
                        Osborn thought this could be done.</p>
                    <p>Turning back again to the language in the second paragraph of the operative
                        text of the resolution, <hi rend="smallcaps">Mrs. Roosevelt</hi> suggested
                        the use of the words “balance of armaments”. Mr. Dulles wondered just what
                        was meant by the existing language “reduction to be required of each
                        nation”. Mr. Jessup thought this language met the Soviet propaganda line,
                        but Mr. Dulles thought the implication should be turned the other way in our
                        favor by referring to a balance, and by showing the Soviet unbalance of
                        power. Mr. Jessup pointed out that all these things took place only after
                        disarmament was accomplished. These clauses for reduction would be operative
                        only after several prerequisites were worked out.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Dulles</hi> pointed out that, nevertheless, the
                        United States will necessarily be building up its armaments. Under these
                        circumstances, how could the phrase “reduction of armaments” be reconciled
                        with the actual situation? Mr. Osborn said the present draft was important
                        because the French could not get away with anything less with their own
                        people. Mr. Dulles said he thought the French should be frankly told that if
                        they wanted this kind of resolution they are going to have a hard time
                        getting arms for themselves from the United States. He thought it was most
                        undesirable to have anything that suggested reduction of armaments for each
                        nation as the desideratum. Ambassador Austin thought it would be preferable
                        to have a perfectly frank statement in paragraph 2 and suggested it might
                        read “to determine the military establishment to be permitted to each
                        nation.” Mr. Osborn suggested alternatively, the phrase “balance to be
                        permitted each nation”. Ambassador Austin commented that this idea might not
                        be so popular but it was the truth. The Secretary noted that two years ago
                        we were afraid to use the word reduction because of the fear of getting off
                        on an emotional bent and subsequently disappointing ourselves. He agreed
                        with Mr. Dulles that the French position was inconsistent, and that they
                        could not eat their cake and have it too. He thought we should tell the
                        French our feeling on this matter quite frankly; that was the key to the
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">The Secretary</hi> asked the Delegation if it agreed to
                        the language “to determine the proper balance of armaments to be permitted
                        to each nation”. Mr. Jessup thought this language would have an unfortunate
                        effect since it assumed we are embarking on disarmament of each nation to
                        achieve a balance. Mrs. Roosevelt noted that the present language,
                        “reduction to be required”, gave the propaganda value, and did not actually
                        say such reduction would be required of each nation but just where it was
                        needed, and would therefore not foreclose other nations from building up
                        their armaments.</p>

                    <p>It is desirable for the United States Delegation to open the debate on this
                        subject. The Canadian, French and British Delegations all feel it is
                        necessary we should open the debate. If Vishinsky makes a violent speech,
                        the British will probably reply. Ambassador Austin’s name has been put down
                        to speak first.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The Canadian Resolution was introduced by the Canadian Delegate immediately
                        upon the opening of debate in Committee 1. It approved the pertinent parts
                        of the First and Second Reports and the Recommendations of the Third Report.
                        There was no provision for continuing the Atomic Energy Commission unless a
                        basis were found for doing so by the General Assembly or the sponsoring
                        powers.</p>
                    <p>Amendments were introduced by Syria, instructing the Atomic Energy Commission
                        to meet and complete the treaty; by India<note n="4" xml:id="d267fn4">Indian

                    <p>The United States Delegate in a first and unprepared speech indicated that
                        the United States was willing to accept a compromise. The amendments,
                        particularly that of Australia, began to be very favorably received. Over
                        night the Canadian Delegate, General McNaughton, arranged with Colonel
                        Hodgson of Australia for the modification of the Australian amendment in a
                        more acceptable form. The United States Delegation felt this was necessary
                        in order to get a two-thirds majority for approval. Telegraphic approval was
                        received from the State Department. The amendment was offered in the next
                        meeting and <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0515"/>the whole matter
                        referred to sub-committee. After a number of meetings the sub-committee
                        reported out two resolutions, namely, the Canadian resolution as amended by
                        the modified Australian amendment by a vote of 8 in favor and 2 against and
                        one abstention and the Soviet resolution<note n="6" xml:id="d267fn6">For

                        against and two abstentions. The sub-committee reported to Committee 1
                        which, after debate, approved the Canadian resolution by a vote of 41 to 6,

                    <p>It is probable that Mr. el Khouri of Syria will reintroduce his resolution or
                        amendment calling for the completion of a treaty by the Atomic Energy
                        Commission. This will fail to gain a majority. It is possible that Mr. el
                        Khouri will then vote for the Canadian resolution. There has been anxiety
                        that the Indian Delegation would again move their resolution. They are
                        particularly anxious that the Reports of the Commission should be approved
                        “in substance” or “in principle.” It is hoped that they will settle for a
                        statement before they vote, to the effect that their approval is contingent
                        not only on completion of the whole treaty but on the approval of the
                        detailed elaboration of what is already written. No trouble is expected from
                        Australia except for the wholly unpredictable nature of Mr. Evatt’s
                        leadership. It is hoped that in the Plenary several nations who have
                        abstained in Committee 1 will vote in favor, especially Ecuador, Argentina,
                        El Salvador. South Africa, Venezuela and Yemen are doubtful.</p>

                    <p>In the afternoon we had speeches by Yugoslavia, Canada, Byelorussia, the
                        United Kingdom, Belgium, Poland, Philippines, Australia, Ukraine.</p>
                    <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0517"/>
                    <p>The Soviet speeches were extraordinarily repetitious and on the same old
                        themes of Wall Street monopoly, invasion of sovereignty, threats of atomic
                        destruction by imperialists. To my surprise, Vishinsky and one other had the
                        effrontery to state at length, and with emphasis, that the decision of the
                        majority of the General Assembly, which he recognized was a foregone
                        conclusion, did not represent the wishes of the majority of the world; that
                        what was a majority of the General Assembly was a minority of the peoples,
                        and what was a majority of the peoples was a minority in the General
                        Assembly. This from the only country in the General Assembly which makes no
                        pretence at free elections.</p>
                    <p>Rolin of Belgium spoke much too long, an hour and ten minutes, but he made an
                        able speech and some of his material was very good. Among other things, he
                        said that the Soviet questioned the sincerity of the United States, to which
                        he wanted to make a very brutal reply, as follows: “It is certain that at
                        present the United States alone has an adequate stock of bombs. During this
                        transition time of brief advantage, they have two choices: one,
                        international control; two, to use the bomb now against their principal
                        enemy before he has it. The latter terrible proposal has been made. It has
                        been considered. It has been refused by the United States public and by the
                        United States military. Having refused this terrible alternative, the United
                        States can only find security in international control. This is conclusive
                        evidence of their sincerity.”</p>
                    <p>Hector McNeil made a brilliant reply to Vishinsky, much of it very
                        quotable.</p>
                    <p>The verbatim record of this whole debate should be scanned carefully for
                        quotations which can be used in future debates. The Soviet made some very

                        on the Commission made some very fine statements which can be used. I am
                        going through the verbatim here myself for excerpts, and will see that we
                        get a full copy for our files in New York.</p>
                    <p>From noon oh Evatt was trying to get us to compromise on a modification of
                        the Indian amendment<note n="3" xml:id="d269fn3">Reference is to the
                            amendment contained in document A/700, proposed by India at the 156th
                            Meeting. The first point of the amendment would have limited approval of
                            the reports of the Atomic Energy Commission to approval “in substance.”
                            The second point consisted of replacing the fourth paragraph of the
                            Canadian resolution with the following: “[The General Assembly] Calls
                            upon the Atomic Energy Commission to resume and continue its work, to
                            proceed with the study of all the matters within its terms of reference,
                            and to prepare for submission to the Security Council, as early as
                            possible, a draft treaty or convention incorporating the Commission’s
                            ultimate proposals.”</note> for continuing the work of the Commission to
                        completion. McNaughton and I refused categorically. From five o’clock on
                        Hector McNeil was trying to get us to compromise by accepting the first part
                        of the Indian amendment which <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0518"/>would
                        have inserted the words “in substance or in principle” in the first
                        paragraph. I refused categorically and turned him over to McNaughton.</p>
                    <p>We had Ben Cohen, who was sitting at the head of the Delegation by that time,
                        all primed to raise a point of procedure if Evatt ruled that the Indian
                        amendments could be passed by a simple majority. But the question never came
                        up. The vote on the first Indian amendment was 9 for, 15 against and 26
                        abstentions. The vote on the second Indian amendment, to have the <gloss
                            target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> complete its work, was 5 for, 31 against
                        and 15 abstentions.<note n="4" xml:id="d269fn4">At the request of the Soviet
                            Delegation, a vote was also taken at the 157th Meeting on Soviet
                            resolution A/C.1/310 (for text, see footnote 1, <ref target="#pg_445">p.

                    </p>
                    <p>It was now very late and we had been struggling to prevent delegates leaving
                        entirely and to bring back some of the absent ones, but with only partial
                        success. The final vote on the Canadian resolution<note n="5"
                            xml:id="d269fn5">

                        </note> was 40 yes, 6 no, and 4 abstentions. The abstentions were
                        Afghanistan, India, South Africa and Venezuela. We expected these and had
                        been working over them, but with no effect. However, we got the votes of
                        Saudi Arabia, Syria, Yemen and Ecuador, all of whom had abstained in
                        Committee 1.</p>
                    <p>The absentees on the final vote were as follows: Costa Rica, El Salvador,
                        Guatemala, Iceland, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan and Siam. All of these would have
                        voted favorably except possibly Iran and Iraq, though these voted favorably
                        in Committee 1 and we have no reason to think they would have abstained if
                        they had been present. There were three important receptions going on that
                        afternoon, including General Marshall’s, and it was very hard to hold the
                        delegates until 8 o’clock, particularly as many thought that the voting
                        would not take place until next day.</p>
                    <p>I suppose there will always be some question whether we could have gotten a
                        two-thirds majority if the resolution had not included instructions to the
                            <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> to go back to work. General
                        McNaughton feels very strongly that such an amendment would have been voted
                        into the resolution in any event by a substantial majority, and that without
                        it we would never have approached two-thirds for the balance of the
                        resolution. I am inclined to agree with him. The thing that really put it
                        through in such fine style was the tremendous support the resolution got
                        from Belgium, France and Australia. Belgium and France would only have gone
                        along with complete suspension if we had used very coercive efforts—if at
                        all. Australia would have fought us to the limit on it and would have had
                        tremendous support from India, Syria, the Philippines, El Salvador, and a
                        considerable number of others. I think we did well to come out as we
                        did.</p>
                    <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0519"/>
                    <p>A very great effort was made with, the Indian Delegation. Mrs. Roosevelt saw
                        Madame Pandit alone and at length. I had two very long luncheons with
                        Benegal Rau to whom I am personally much attached. Mrs. Roosevelt had Madame
                        Pandit and Mr. Nehru to lunch alone with me and we had a great go at them.
                        McNaughton also worked on them continuously and at great length. But the
                        Indian mind seems able to close itself to the harsher realities of
                        life,…</p>
                    <p>We made an equal effort with South Africa. I saw them a considerable number
                        of times and so did McNaughton. But the problem of the continued domination
                        of five million blacks by 300,000 whites is fully occupying their minds.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that there are several lessons to be learned in this
                        presentation to the General Assembly.</p>
                    <p>The first lesson is that before coming to the General Assembly with a
                        proposition we ought to conduct a sort of seminar on what the reaction is
                        likely to be. In this case I think we would have foreseen the reaction that
                        a large number of delegates would want to continue the <gloss
                            target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss>. Had we foreseen this we could have
                        prepared our speeches and arguments accordingly. Instead, the delegation was
                        not only unprepared but many members of the delegation had not thought the
                        thing through sufficiently to be able to put up any argument at all.</p>
                    <p>The second lesson is that a delegation should be thoroughly and exhaustively
                        briefed among all its members on a matter of this sort, so that the
                        delegates and alternates and all the political officers thoroughly
                        understand the matter and can argue about it insistently. Practically no
                        briefing of this sort was done until after we had gotten well into the
                        debate, and then only with small groups. This kind of briefing is not
                        possible after the work of the Assembly started. It should be done two or
                        three days before the Assembly starts. The whole delegation should be on the
                        spot, at least three days before the Assembly is due to open, instead of
                        arriving at one o’clock the opening morning.</p>
                    <p>A third lesson is that the real preparatory work for a debate in the General
                        Assembly is done in the Atomic Energy Commission itself. The Canadian
                        resolution would never have gotten a two-thirds vote, or even a majority
                        vote, if it had not been for the full understanding and enthusiastic support
                        of de Rose,<note n="6" xml:id="d269fn6">François de Rose, Adviser, French

                        in his own way, Hodgson. These men felt that they had a personal interest in
                        getting the work they themselves had done approved in the General
                        Assembly.</p>

                    <p>Even when they were superseded in their delegation by prominent figures like
                        Mr. Ramadier and Senator Rolin, they were able in a week or ten days fully
                        to bring these men into agreement with their views, and so to educate them
                        that on the last day these men were making exceedingly able speeches. I must
                        include also Mr. el Khouri, who made a powerful attack on the Soviet for
                        daring to say that this was an American plan, after all the work he, Mr. el
                        Khouri, and the others had done on it. That speech had a very important
                        effect on the Arab delegations.<note n="8" xml:id="d269fn8">Reference is
                            presumably to El Khoury’s statement at the 163rd Meeting of the First

                    </p>
                    <p>This last lesson, therefore, is the most important of all. We can get
                        important support in the General Assembly for any measure which in itself is
                        sound, and which has been developed and worked up by the cooperative effort
                        of a number of different states.</p>
                    <p>This is something we must bear very much in mind as we determine what work in
                        the <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> we deem practical or useful.</p>

                    <p>It was not expected that the subject of disarmament would be raised in this
                        General Assembly. However, at the start of the Assembly Vishinsky introduced
                        the surprise Soviet resolution demanding the prohibition of atomic arms and
                        the one-third reduction of arms of the five big powers. It was early agreed
                        among the other nations that the Vishinsky proposal was pure propaganda and
                        should be voted down in its entirety, and a new resolution prepared to take
                        its place, which resolution would instruct the Commission on Conventional
                        Armaments to continue its work. The United Kingdom Delegation prepared such
                        a resolution<note n="5" xml:id="d270fn5">For information on the British
                            resolution, A/C.1/319, see footnote 7, <ref target="#pg_461">p.
                                461</ref>.</note> and the United States would have been willing to
                        back it. It was, however, unacceptable to the French and Belgian Delegations
                        because it was critical of the Soviet Union and was not in their opinion
                        constructive. The French prepared and presented a resolution which appeared
                        to propose the formulation of new plans outside of the Commission for
                        Conventional Armaments. After prolonged conversations, the Belgians
                        presented an amendment to the French <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0522"
                        />resolution, keeping the work in the <gloss target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss>,

                        effort should be to develop plans for and actually to set up an
                        international organ which would receive, verify and publish figures on
                        armies and armaments. This amendment was whipped into shape and accepted by
                        the French. It was adopted by the Sub-Committee and sent to Committee 1. In
                        Committee 1 minor changes were made in the text by amendments proposed by
                        the French and Australians, and the final text was adopted and recommended
                        to the Plenary. The original Soviet resolution was also voted on in
                        Committee 1, and was rejected by a vote of 41 to 6, with one abstention.</p>

                    <p>The Franco-Belgian text will be submitted for vote in the Plenary with strong
                        support by Belgium, France, the United States and other nations. There is no
                        doubt that it will have almost the unanimous support of the Assembly, except
                        for the 6 Soviet votes. There is little likelihood of its amendment. Any
                        amendments which would provide for the publication of any information prior
                        to verification by the inspection of an international organ should be
                        vigorously rejected.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet will undoubtedly insist on a vote being taken on their original
                        resolution, paragraph by paragraph, and as a whole. We should vote
                        resolutely against every paragraph as well as against the resolution as a
                        whole. We cannot afford any chance that some paragraphs might be accepted by
                        a small majority due to abstentions. It is also likely that Katz-Suchy<note

                    <p>Mr. Osborn explained that all delegations recognized the Soviet proposal as
                        pure propaganda. It would be voted down overwhelmingly. He commented that
                        the Commission for Conventional Armaments had been a source of embarrassment
                        for us since it was set up to plan a <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0523"
                        />reduction of armaments, which was not presently possible, and the United
                        States had had to fight a delaying action in the Commission. Fortunately,
                        the USSR had brought up disarmament originally. The resulting proposal was
                        very satisfactory to the United States. Rolin of Belgium, a great proponent
                        of disarmament, had worked out a scheme which would mean that instead of the
                            <gloss target="#t_CCA1">CCA</gloss> attempting to reduce armaments and
                        develop plans for an international agency, it would plan for the receipt,
                        verification and publication of figures on armaments and then make plans for
                        their presentation to the Security Council which would be in a position to
                        set up an international agency. The effect of the proposal would be to open
                        up the USSR to general inspection. He thought it was impossible to imagine
                        that the USSR would accept this proposal, but it would be difficult for it
                        to find reasons to veto the resulting action of the Security Council, once
                        the proposal came to the Council as a result of the inspection, etc.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dulles asked whether, if an organ was established to receive, check and
                        publish data on armaments, the United States would be under an obligation to
                        report if the USSR did not. Mr. Osborn said the United States would not, if
                        the USSR did not accept. He thought, and the military advisers had agreed,
                        that it would be possible to work out a form for the transmission of
                        information which would be acceptable to the United States.</p>
                    <p>No further action by the Delegation was required on this matter.</p>
