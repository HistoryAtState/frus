                <p>The Department of State released today <ref target="frus1969-76v19p1">
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States, 1969–1976, Volume
                            XIX, Part 1</hi>, Korea, 1969–1972</ref>. (Part 2 of the volume on U.S.
                    bilateral relations with Japan, 1969–1972 will be published at a later date.)
                    During the first <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration,
                    Washington confronted an array of difficult foreign policy questions concerning
                    the Korean peninsula. The preponderance of documents published in this volume
                    concern security issues. As in earlier years, U.S. policymakers continued to
                    deal with North Korean provocations between 1969 and 1972, the most serious
                    being the North Korean Air Force’s destruction of a U.S. surveillance (<gloss
                        target="#t_EC1211">EC–121</gloss>) airplane over the Sea of Japan in April
                    1969. The U.S. military presence in South Korea also surfaced as an important
                    topic. During <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>’s first term, the
                    United States reduced its forces in Korea from 63,000 to 43,000 soldiers.
                    Although President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> was unable to
                    prevent the U.S. drawdown, he did extract aid with which to modernize the South
                    Korean military. Other records in this publication relate to the deployment of
                    South Korean combat forces in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>This volume documents U.S. satisfaction with the Republic of Korea’s increasing
                    confidence as an international actor, a result of the South’s burgeoning
                    economic prosperity and its (uneven) growth in political stability. <persName
                        corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> successfully thwarted efforts to improve
                    the relationship between Japan and North Korea. Instead, South Korea made its
                    own contacts with the North Korean Government, an initiative that yielded few
                    tangible results but did promote regional stability. Nonetheless, the <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration was not fully successful
                    at allaying Seoul’s misgivings about two of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName>’s most important foreign policy initiatives: the
                    improvement in relations between the United States and China, and the U.S.
                    departure from Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s fears
                    about U.S. reliability added to tensions that resulted from economic
                    competition, especially in the textile trade.</p>
                <p>The Republic of Korea’s skepticism of the U.S. security guarantee was used to
                    justify authoritarian domestic policies. In 1970 <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                        >Park</persName> and his party amended the Korean Constitution to permit his
                    election to a third term as the country’s president. The following year, the two
                    titans of late 20th century South Korean politics, <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                        >Park Chung Hee</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KDJ1">Kim Dae
                        Jung</persName>, competed for the presidency. Department of State officials
                    endeavored to demonstrate balance by making themselves available to both
                    candidates. When <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>, victorious in the
                    1971 election, declared martial law in October 1972, the U.S. Government
                    expressed frustration with this blow to the Republic of Korea’s political
                    institutions. U.S. officials feared that alliance with South Korea could be seen
                    by some as implicating them in <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s
                    actions. Given <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s determination to
                    adopt anti-democratic measures, U.S. efforts to respond by punishing South Korea
                    would likely be either ineffective or create instability there, either outcome
                    potentially damaging the U.S.-Korean relationship.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of
                    the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of
                    the General Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of
                    State Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific
                    standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26,
                    1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, established a new
                    statutory charter for the preparation of the series which was signed by
                    President George H.W. Bush on October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138
                    added a new Title IV to the Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956
                    (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions
                    and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series should
                    include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major
                    foreign policy decisions and actions of the U.S. Government. The statute also
                    confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles of
                    historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions
                    made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the
                    published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching
                    a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of concealing a
                    defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after the events
                    recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume meets all regulatory,
                    statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and editing.</p>

                <p>During the first <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration,
                    Washington confronted an array of difficult foreign policy questions concerning
                    the Korean peninsula. Between 1969 and 1972, U.S. policymakers responded to
                    North Korean hostility with circumspect countermeasures. At the same time, the
                    United States supported the South Korean economic “miracle,” and offered
                    military assistance to increase the preparedness of the South Korean armed
                    forces. In 1971, Washington withdrew 20,000 American troops from Korea, an
                    expression of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine
                    accomplished with limited damage to bilateral goodwill. Concurrently, the U.S.
                    Government sought to moderate KoreanPresident <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park
                        Chung Hee</persName>’s dictatorial tendencies, encourage democracy, and
                    promote human rights without undermining other foreign policy goals. These
                    issues produced disagreements within the U.S. Government and between officials
                    in Seoul and Washington. South Korean and U.S. officials also struggled to
                    settle textile trade issues, and labored to update their bilateral partnership
                    to fit the changing Cold War landscape. But on the whole, U.S.-Korean relations
                    during these years strengthened the alliance that had begun immediately after
                    World War II.</p>
                <p>The preponderance of documents published in this volume concerns security issues.
                    As in earlier years, U.S. policymakers continued to deal with North Korean
                    provocations between 1969 and 1972, the most serious being the North Korean Air
                    Force’s destruction of a U.S. surveillance (<gloss target="#t_EC1211"

                    in this volume show how the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> team
                    balanced diverse and sometimes competing inclinations to meet the North Korean
                    challenge. The U.S. military presence in South Korea also surfaced as an
                    important topic. During <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>’s first
                    term, the United States reduced its forces in Korea from 63,000 to 43,000
                    American servicemen. At first,President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                        >Park</persName> aggressively opposed the American drawdown, insisting that
                    the U.S. reduction should be small, and that any military realignment should be
                    accompanied by a sharp rise in U.S. military assistance to the Republic of
                    Korea. Seoul’s objection to the U.S. plan related to its unflattering appraisal
                    of Vietnamization and its fear of North Korean aggression. Although <persName
                        corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> failed to prevent the removal of 20,000
                    U.S. soldiers, he did extract from his U.S. counterpart a massive package of aid
                    to modernize the South Korean military. Other records in this publication relate
                    to the deployment of South Korean combat forces in Vietnam. The Republic of
                    Korea maintained two divisions in South Vietnam; during a 1972 battlefield
                    crisis President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> personally called
                    on President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> to employ these troops
                    in <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0006"/>the central highlands. Notwithstanding
                    the overall South Korean commitment to the Vietnam campaign, the <persName
                        corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> administration found it politically
                    difficult to maintain its foreign military presence there, particularly in light
                    of Washington’s scaled back commitment to Asia. Beyond issues directly related
                    to South Korean defense, this collection therefore reveals the bilateral
                    dimensions of Korea’s involvement in the Vietnam conflict.</p>
                <p>Washington’s work to redefine Cold War international relations, with all its
                    attendant consequences, surfaces here in many forms. For years before 1969, U.S.
                    officials had pressed Seoul to become a more confident international actor. This
                    installment of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> depicts U.S.
                    satisfaction when the Republic of Korea increasingly did just that during the
                    early 1970s. The new South Korean attitude grew from both economic prosperity
                    and political stability. Since the mid-1960s, South Korea’s real gross national
                    product, industrial output and general exports had increased dramatically;
                    meanwhile, as <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> “slowly achieved
                    dominance of South Korean political life and the acceptance of his countrymen by
                    virtue of solid accomplishment,” his government provided the republic with a
                    prolonged period of political stability (<ref target="#d80">Document 80</ref>).
                    This volume demonstrates South Korea’s new confidence. When Tokyo and Pyongyang
                    moved to improve their relationship, for example, Seoul (trusting neither
                    country) unleashed a campaign to foil Japanese-North Korean reconciliation.
                        <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> eventually won <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>’s support on this front, and South Korea
                    and the United States convinced Japan to cool its relationship with North Korea
                    after 1972. Also that year, self-assured South Korean officials made their own
                    contact with the North Korean Government. Although those discussions ultimately
                    yielded few tangible results, the North-South dialogue did promote regional
                    stability; symbolically, the meetings captured Seoul’s willingness to confront
                    the North Korean threat. The remarkable change in attitude notwithstanding,
                    South Korean confidence still had its limits, exposed during <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>’s remaking of the Chinese-American
                    relationship, when President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> and his
                    advisors feared that the U.S. move might compromise South Korean interests.
                    American diplomats worked to dispossess South Korean officials of these
                    misgivings, albeit with mixed results. In the end, the episode, when combined
                    with the records of bilateral textile trade negotiations, illustrate the
                    continuing limits of South Korean influence.</p>
                <p>This volume also deals with South Korean internal political affairs. President
                        <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> believed that South Korea faced
                    a serious crisis, in which the country needed his leadership to negotiate a
                    threatening era. The South Korean president insisted that the U.S. departure
                    from Vietnam and the reordering of relations between global powers endangered
                    the Republic of Korea. In 1970 <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> and
                    his party amended the Korean Constitution to permit his election to a third term
                    as the <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0007"/>country’s president. The following
                    year, the two titans of late twentieth century South Korean politics, <persName
                        corresp="#p_PCH1">Park Chung Hee</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KDJ1"
                        >Kim Dae Jung</persName>, competed for the presidency. Department of State
                    officials endeavored to demonstrate balance by making themselves available to
                    both candidates and advising <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> and
                        <persName>Kim</persName> on topics related to democratic politics. U.S.
                    diplomatic assessments printed in this volume convey contemporary perspectives
                    on the South Korean political experience. One government analyst described
                        <persName>Kim</persName> as “a proven vote getter with a persuasive manner
                    and an eloquent, oratorical style” who “likes to be called the
                        ‘<persName>Kennedy</persName> of Korea’” (<ref target="#d83">Document
                        83</ref>). While <persName>Kim</persName>’s New Democratic Party was
                    disorganized and “short of money,” <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>
                    was superbly organized and brought in two of the most skillful politicians in
                    Korea to bolster his effort, <persName corresp="#p_KJP1">Kim Jong Pil</persName>
                    to be his Prime Minister and <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Lee Hu Rak</persName>
                    to be Korean <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Director. When <persName
                        corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>, victorious in the 1971 election, declared
                    martial law in October 1972, the U.S. Government expressed frustration. In a
                    meeting with South Korean Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KDJ2">Kim Dong
                        Jo</persName>, Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U.

                        >US</gloss> Government who had been closely associated with Korea were
                    deeply disappointed. While it was not for the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                    to tell Korea how to run its affairs, he was apprehensive over the future and
                    sorry for Korea” (<ref target="#d163">Document 163</ref>). An airgram from the
                    Embassy in Korea to the Department of State described a dilemma that troubled
                    many U.S. officials: “our long-term presence here and continuing relationship
                    with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> associate us, at least tacitly,
                    with the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>. It is clear that no mere wrist

                    political designs. He and those around him are committed to establishing a
                    severely controlled society. This we can deter only by direct and drastic
                    intervention which would threaten <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s

                    Administration and the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Estate. In
                    February 1971, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> initiated
                    a voice activated taping system in the Oval Office of the White House, and,
                    subsequently, in the President’s Office in the Executive Office Building, Camp
                    David, the Cabinet Room, and White House and Camp David telephones. The
                    audiotapes include conversations of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> with his Assistant for National Security Affairs,

                    advised that the tape recording is the official document; the transcript

                    and other advances in technology, the Office of the Historian has been able to
                    enhance the tape recordings and over time produce more accurate transcripts. The
                    result is that some transcripts printed here may differ from transcripts of the
                    same conversations printed in previous <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    volumes. The most accurate transcripts possible, however, cannot substitute for

                    those aspects of the conversations that cannot be captured in a transcript, such

                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 12958, as amended, on Classified
                    National Security Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The
                    declassification review of this volume, which began in 2003 and was completed in
                    2009, resulted in the decision to withhold 1 document in full, excise a
                    paragraph or more in 5 documents, and make minor excisions of less than a
                    paragraph in 17 documents.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume, and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the documentation and editorial notes presented here
                    provide an accurate and comprehensive account of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> administration’s policy toward Korea from 1969 until
                    1972.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires
                    that government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                    engaged in foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the
                    Department of State historians by providing full and complete access to records
                    pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of
                    selected records. Most of the sources consulted in the preparation of this
                    volume have been declassified and are available for review at the National
                    Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and the memoranda of conversations
                    between the President and the Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the
                    files of overseas diplomatic posts. All of the Department’s indexed central
                    files for 1969–1972 have been permanently transferred to the National Archives
                    and Records Administration (Archives II) at College Park, Maryland. Almost all
                    the Department’s decentralized office (or lot) files covering this period, which
                    the National Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred
                    or are in the process of being transferred from the Department’s custody to
                    Archives II.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have full

                    and other White House foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and

                    agencies including the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence

                    to his papers at the Library of Congress.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians also have full access to records of the Department

                    located in the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress are second in
                    importance. While the <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> Papers
                    contain copies of many of the most important items found in the <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials Project, the chief
                    advantage of these files is that they are well-organized and contain fewer
                    materials on administrative matters of little value to most researchers. The
                    most useful parts of the <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> Papers
                    are the Chronological Files, Memoranda of Conversations, Memoranda for the
                    President, and a collection of documents organized by country under the
                    Geopolitical Files heading. The <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                    papers also contain records of <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                    >Kissinger</persName>’s telephone conversations (telcons). Copies of the
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> telephone conversations are
                    also available <pb n="XV" xml:id="pg_XV" facs="0016"/>at the National Archives
                    and are open to the public. Another useful item in the <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> Papers is a typed version of
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>’s daily schedule. This is
                    found under Miscellany, 1968–1976, Record of Schedule, though the schedule
                    before August 31, 1970, has not been located. Access to these papers currently

                            <item>We have reviewed the evidence on North Korea’s intentions and
                                capabilities vis-à-vis South Korea. We conclude that, under present
                                circumstances, Pyongyang does not intend to invade South Korea; nor
                                do we believe that Pyongyang is deliberately trying to provoke the
                                Republic of Korea (<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>) (and/or the
                                    <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>) into a resumption of major
                                hostilities. We do believe, however, that North Korean Premier
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-song</persName> is committed
                                to a strategy of developing a “revolutionary struggle” in the South
                                and this his campaign will continue to include harassment of <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_US1"

                            <item>In our view, North Korea’s prospects for establishing guerrilla
                                bases in South Korea or developing significant political support
                                among the populace are quite poor, at least over the next two years
                                or so. Communist violence will, however, continue to be a costly
                                distraction for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government
                                and a potential cause of public dissatisfaction with the <persName

                            <item>In pursuing its campaign of violence, Pyongyang seems willing to
                                live with a situation that presents a continuing danger of
                                retaliatory attack by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-song</persName> is apparently
                                confident that he can <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0029"/>control
                                the situation, stopping short of actions certain to provoke a major
                                reaction. If <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> reactions to North
                                Korean provocations continue to be almost entirely defensive,
                                Pyongyang might be tempted at some point to go well beyond incidents
                                along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and occasional

                                they take place would depend on how the North Koreans judged the

                                arise from a deliberate decision of one side or the other, but that
                                it might result from miscalculation—for example, in the process of

                                North Korea may overplay its hand and lead the South Koreans to

                            <item>We believe that, even in these circumstances, North Korea would
                                wish to avoid full-scale war. In a crisis, decisions in Pyongyang—as
                                in Seoul—would be affected, perhaps decisively, by the attitudes of
                                major allies. In our view, given no major change in Soviet or
                                Chinese attitudes, both Moscow and Peking would probably urge North
                                Korea to avoid a full-scale war. Yet despite these considerations,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-song</persName>’s manner of
                                thought and action is such that the North Korean response would be
                                difficult to predict with confidence. A critical element in both
                                North and South Korean thinking during any crisis would be the
                                    <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> posture, or what they believe
                                it to be. But we believe that North Korea would feel that the
                                initiation of major hostilities against the South would bring about
                                    <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military response,
                                particularly while <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> ground forces
                                are stationed in South Korea.</item>

                            <item>We cannot say exactly how a Vietnamese settlement would affect
                                    <persName>Kim</persName>’s current course. It would depend
                                primarily on how he interpreted the outcome in terms of <gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss> willingness to take a firm stand
                                against further North Korean provocations. Thus, he could become
                                somewhat more aggressive or more cautious. Given his strong public
                                commitment to the promotion of revolution in the South, however, it
                                is unlikely that he will abandon his objectives, even though he may
                                modify his tactics.</item>

                                corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and had attached great
                            importance to keeping in close contact with him through letters and
                            through meetings at Honolulu and elsewhere. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> would very much hope to continue
                            this custom and maintain the closest of relations with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and the senior members
                            of the new Administration.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary responded that he certainly concurred in the desirability
                            of such contacts without being able at this time to offer any views on
                            just how this should be done. He said that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> was simply not at the moment
                            addressing himself to the question of where and when he would travel
                            next, having just returned from Europe. The President very definitely
                            did not want his trip to Europe to appear to indicate any lack of
                            interest on the part of this Administration in other areas.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KDJ2">Kim</persName> said he appreciated
                            these assurances, since the comments which had come out of the White
                            House in connection with the European trip had spoken of such things as
                            Summit Meetings with the Soviet leaders, and of the importance of the
                            Middle East and Latin America, but had not mentioned the importance of
                            the Far East. The Secretary acknowledged that it was difficult to keep a
                            completely satisfactory balance, since whenever one mentioned one area
                            it created questions as to why some other area was not mentioned, but
                            the Administration was by no means unconcerned about Asia. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KDJ2">Kim</persName> said that, speaking
                            personally rather than as a diplomat, he very much hoped that the new
                            Administration would exert itself to overcome the impression which had
                            been created regarding its supposed focus on Europe. The Asians needed
                            the sort of psychological lift which can be given them by reaffirmation
                            of American interest.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KDJ2">Kim</persName> noted that
                            high-level visits are one way of expressing this interest. He had called
                            on Deputy Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_PD1"
                                >Packard</persName> and invited him to the Defense
                            Ministries’meeting, which was planned for May in Seoul. He had also
                            called on Secretary of Commerce <persName corresp="#p_SMH1"
                                >Stans</persName> and reached temporary agreement on a Commerce
                            Ministers’ meeting in Seoul in September. He said that he would urge the
                            United States to consider undertaking with Korea the sort of regular
                            ministerial meetings which we now had with Japan under the leadership of
                            the Secretary of State. His Government would very much welcome a visit
                            to Korea by the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> responded that he
                            would very much like to accept such an invitation. He said he hoped he
                            might be able to go to Korea during the trip which is planned in
                            connection with the Japanese ministerial talks in June. (<hi

                            The Secretary promised to look at his schedule in this connection.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KDJ2">Kim</persName> drew attention to
                            the very major problem which protectionist tendencies in the United
                            States would create for Korea. He said that this was nothing less than a
                            matter of life and death for his people. He pointed out that one-third
                            of Korean sales in the United States are now textiles of man-made fibers
                            and that any sort of restrictions on this portion of the market would be
                            a serious threat to the export target of $400 million set by his
                            Government for 1969. The Korean Government has to carry a very heavy
                            military burden and it must have economic prosperity and development if
                            it is to do its share in the military field.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Paris Talks</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he would like to ask the Secretary for his
                            evaluation of the prospects at the Paris peace talks. Were they bright?
                            The Secretary responded that the objectives for which we are working in
                            Viet-Nam and in Paris are quite clear: the freedom for the South
                            Vietnamese to determine their own future. We do not yet know if the
                            North Vietnamese are sincerely interested in peace on these terms, and
                            he could not at this point characterize the situation in Paris as bright
                            or as anything else. As the Ambassador was undoubtedly aware from the
                            newspapers, we are suggesting mutual troop withdrawals as an area in
                            which progress might be made, but as of this moment he could not see
                            clearly at all whether there would be progress. He said that if the
                            prospects look good we would then of course be consulting promptly with
                            our Korean and other allies.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KDJ2">Kim</persName> asked if it might
                            be possible that the Administration would soon be making a clear
                            statement of its objectives in Asia. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> responded that our objectives in
                            Asia are in large part determined by our treaty obligations there. The
                            Ambassador asked if we did not think it would be desirable to put
                            something on the record about support for those nations which are
                            “bastions of freedom” in the Far East, etc. The Secretary said he did
                            not think it was timely to do so, that the mood of the American public
                            would not be receptive to what might be called hard-line or belligerent
                            statements. There was, he added, no question of our “throwing in the
                            towel” in Asia. We would persist in fulfilling our commitments there,
                            but we do very much seek an honorable end to the fighting.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador referred to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName>’s views on regional cooperation in Asia and asked
                            whether the Secretary felt that what the President had in mind there was
                            primarily economic and cultural cooperation <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7"
                                facs="0034"/>or whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> had been thinking of regional security
                            arrangements. The Secretary answered that he thought it was the former.
                            The United States could not really at this point consider any further
                            security commitments. He did not have to draw the Ambassador’s attention
                            to the climate of opinion on this subject in Congress and in the press.
                            As for arrangements among the nations of the area, that was of course
                            another matter. He did not, however, think that we believed the timing
                            would be appropriate now for new security pacts among the free Asian
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said there had been discussion among his colleagues about
                            possibly extending an invitation to the United States to join <gloss
                                target="#t_ASPAC1">ASPAC</gloss>. He wondered what the Secretary’s
                            reaction might to be such a thought. The Secretary said that he did not
                            think it would be wise to consider this possibility. He felt that the
                            congressional reaction to further engagements, even of this sort, would
                            be negative.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador thanked the Secretary very much for being so generous with
                            his time and said that, on his imminent return to Korea, he would
                            certainly be arranging for a formal invitation to the Secretary to visit
                            Seoul. He asked if there was anything in particular the Secretary wished
                            conveyed to President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>
                            personally. The Secretary said that he would be grateful if the
                            Ambassador would convey Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName>’s personal regards and underline the high esteem in
                            which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> holds President
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>. He said he would also
                            be grateful if the Ambassador would express to the President and to
                            others the deep appreciation of this Administration and, in fact of all
                            the American people, for the very important contribution which the
                            Koreans are making in Viet-Nam. This was a matter on which he knew
                            Americans felt very strongly. The Ambassador promised to do so and said
                            his farewells.</p>

                            study for Korea. This study should examine possible U.S. actions in
                            light of an outbreak of hostilities due to limited or full scale attacks
                            by North Korea or unilateral South Korean responses to North Korean
                            provocation. As directed in the guidelines for contingency planning,
                            this paper should include a careful orchestration of political and
                            military actions.</p>
                        <p>The East Asian Interdepartmental Group should perform this study and
                            forward it to the Review Group by April 25, 1969.<note n="2"

                            President expressed admiration for Korea’s economic development and the
                            contribution of its forces in Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>In response to the President’s question about the current developments in
                            Korea, <persName corresp="#p_CIK1">Chung</persName> launched into an
                            extended discourse on Korea’s needs. He began by describing the militant
                            and threatening attitude of the North Korean regime and their efforts to
                            infiltrate and stir up trouble in South Korea. He explained that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-sung</persName>’s objective was
                            to provoke dissidence in the South and try to set up centers of
                            Communist subversion there similar to those which existed in South
                            Vietnam. All of this, in the Prime Minister’s mind, is a prelude to
                            major aggression of which the North Koreans were quite capable.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CIK1">Chung</persName> said that basically it is
                            important to avoid a repetition of the mistakes made in 1950, when
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> excluded Korea
                            from the areas crucial to forward defense in Asia, thereby encouraging
                                <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-sung</persName> and the Russians
                            to launch the Korean War. He suggested four major steps: <list>

                                    the Vietnamese war is over. Some people had interpreted
                                    Operation Focus Retina as indicating American intention to
                                    withdraw some of its forces from Korea and this was bad. The
                                    U.S. military presence was important both militarily and
                                    psychologically.</item>

                                    This means that the South Korean air force and navy which are
                                    half the strength of the North Korean forces should be brought
                                    up to even balance with the North.</item>

                            about Japanese pressure for return of Okinawa. Okinawa is very important
                            to Korean security and the Koreans are not sympathetic with the Japanese
                            desire for reversion. Korea has been providing for Japan’s security
                            while Japan has been growing economically powerful. The Japanese should
                            understand this.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CIK1">Chung</persName> suggested that we should be
                            patient and firm with the Communists and not expect much to develop
                            quickly from the Paris negotiations. He thought we should be prepared to
                            fight for two or three years if necessary in order to avoid another
                            Panmunjom agreement. The surest way to bring the North Vietnamese to a
                            peaceful settlement was to apply the pressure of force. He did have a
                            plan for ending the war quickly. If resumption of bombing in the north
                            is not desired, the port of Haiphong should be blockaded and mined, thus
                            cutting off the preponderance of supplies from the Soviet Union which
                            could not very well be brought overland. The closing of the Haiphong
                            port would hurt the North Vietnamese badly and put pressure on the
                            Russians since the Chinese had cut off rail transportation of arms from
                            the Soviet Union through China. Consideration should also be given to
                            sending forces across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> into North
                            Vietnam. If the Chinese Communists threatened to intervene, the
                            President should write a letter to <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao
                                Tse-tung</persName> saying that if they did he would use the nuclear
                            bomb against them. Pressures of this kind, said the Prime Minister,
                            would bring about a settlement very quickly.</p>
                        <p>The President said we would give very serious consideration to Korean
                            views on its military requirements.</p>

                            consultation on this question. The President said that we would of
                            course consult closely with Korea on this and other problems of mutual
                            interest.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister opened the conversation by expressing on behalf of his
                            Government the very great regret which the Korean leaders and the Korean
                            people felt about the passing of General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"

                            the Secretary had a brief dialogue about General <persName

                            Korea.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he hoped very much that the Secretary would
                            be able to come to Seoul in the near future, perhaps either just before
                            or just after his visit to Japan for the ministerial talks with the
                            Japanese. The Secretary said that, as he had told Ambassador <persName

                            he would do so.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he would first like to take up with the
                            Secretary matters of common concern in the security field. He said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-song</persName> had three years
                            ago shifted North Korean policies from peaceful unification to the use
                            of force to achieve unification. Since that time the North Koreans had
                            been despatching guerrillas to stir up trouble in the South. Fortunately
                            the situation in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> was entirely
                            different from that in South Viet-Nam. The North Korean tactics are to
                            establish points and eventually areas of guerrilla activity, but the
                            people of the South do not cooperate with them and the armed forces and
                                <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0039"/>police have been able to mop
                            up these guerrilla bands. Last November the North Koreans had made their
                            largest intrusion since the Korean War by putting ashore more than 110
                            guerrillas on the East Coast. However, an Army division, working
                            together with Home Guard units, had completely cleaned up this
                            infiltration. Why, then, it may be asked, does <persName
                                corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-song</persName> continue in this
                            unsuccessful operation? The Prime Minister suggested that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-song</persName> retains the hope of
                            establishing bases, of damaging South Korean industry, of harassing
                            communications lines, and of compelling the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1"
                                >ROKG</gloss> to thin out its defenses along the front. Then, if
                            they are successful in this, the North Koreans will launch a general
                            attack.</p>
                        <p>This North Korean strategy shows clearly the importance of maintaining
                            United States forces in Korea. These forces, the Prime Minister said,
                            are the key factor in preventing a war from breaking out there. The
                            principal objective of <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim
                                Il-song</persName> is in fact to get United States forces out. The
                            Prime Minister said that, although from a strictly military point of
                            view, he could not argue that certain reductions in the United States
                            forces would have a disastrous impact, he did feel that the
                            psychological consequences of any reduction would be most serious.
                            Moreover, any reduction in forces, however small, would be a great
                            encouragement to the North Koreans.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked how many troops the North Koreans had in their Army.
                            The Prime Minister answered that there were some 420,000 regular troops
                            plus more than a million more in militia-type units. The North Korean
                            air force had some 720 aircraft which was more than twice the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> air force. The Secretary asked about
                            the size of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces and the
                            Prime Minister answered that they were now at the level of about 620,000
                            men. Although this compared favorably with the 500,000 men in the North
                            Korean armed forces, the North Koreans were exceedingly well equipped
                            and thoroughly trained. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            Government, therefore, hoped very much that the United States would
                            continue to maintain its two combat divisions in Korea.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if this was not just about the same level as the
                            Korean forces in Viet-Nam, and the Prime Minister responded that it was.
                            The Secretary said that the American Government appreciates very much
                            what is being achieved by these forces in Viet-Nam. The Prime Minister
                            referred to the tragic experience of 1950, which he connected directly
                            to former Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_AD1"
                                >Acheson</persName>’s comments regarding Korea. He naturally hoped
                            that there would never be any repetition of this tragedy. The Secretary
                            said he quite understood the Prime Minister’s point.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that it was absolutely essential to maintain a
                            favorable balance of power in Korea, one where superiority was clearly
                            on our side, so that the North Koreans would not be tempted to launch
                            any general offensive. For this reason, it was most essential <pb n="13"
                                xml:id="pg_13" facs="0040"/>to pursue the modernization of <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces. The <gloss target="#t_M11"
                                >M–1</gloss> rifle should be rapidly replaced by the <gloss
                                target="#t_M161">M–16</gloss>. The problem of spare parts and of
                            ammunition should be effectively solved. The Prime Minister drew
                            attention to the importance of the Homeland Guard units (Homeland
                            Reserve Forces). Some two million men had been enrolled in these units
                            since January 1968 and the United States contribution of <gloss
                                target="#t_M11">M–1</gloss> rifles had been very much appreciated.
                            More was needed, however. From North Korean films it was possible to
                            conclude that their militia was heavily armed with anti-aircraft
                            artillery, for example, and not merely light personal weapons. He
                            pointed out that it had required substantial forces from three regular
                            divisions to round up the 31 infiltrators who had attempted to
                            assassinate President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>. More
                            recently, some 27,000 men had been put into the field in order to track
                            down the 110 infiltrators on the East Coast. More and better equipment
                            was needed for the forces who would do these jobs. At present, there
                            were only some thirty rounds of ammunition available for each soldier,
                            which was merely enough for training, but not enough for any action. He
                            said he hoped that, as <gloss target="#t_M11">M–1</gloss> rifles and
                            carbines became excess to United States needs, they could be provided
                            free of cost for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> reserve units,
                            and he hoped that facilities could be provided so that the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> could itself turn out the ammunition
                            for these weapons.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">

                        </p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said the second point he would raise was the problem
                            of the United States bases in Okinawa. He was sure this would be
                            discussed by the Secretary during his meetings in Japan and by the
                            Japanese Foreign Minister when he came to Washington. He pointed out
                            that Japan’s security problems, both external and internal, would take a
                            very different shape if the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> did not
                            occupy the position it did.</p>
                        <p>Japan and the United States had a mutual defense treaty, but the Japanese
                            did not seem to be clear about who was threatening their security. They
                            are trying to bargain with the United States over Okinawa and fail to
                            realize that their treaty with the United States really benefits not the
                            United States but Japan. Okinawa is connected to the main line of
                            resistance against communist aggression, the line which runs from Korea
                            through Okinawa to Taiwan and beyond. It is therefore very important
                            that the United States not give up its nuclear and other rights on its
                            Okinawa bases. The United States must not allow this gap to develop in
                            the defensive line. The Prime Minister said that eventually it might be
                            possible to build up compensating strength, for example, to build up the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Navy, but this sort of thing
                            would take a long time.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary responded that the United States well understands the
                            Korean attitude on the Okinawa problem. The Japanese, of course, <pb
                                n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0041"/>make a plea on this matter which
                            is almost the opposite of the position the Prime Minister had set forth.
                            The United States is nevertheless very conscious of the factors to which
                            the Prime Minister had drawn attention and will have these factors very
                            much in mind during the negotiations with the Japanese.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Viet-Nam</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that the Korean Government clearly understands
                            the United States intention with regard to an eventual withdrawal of
                            forces from Viet-Nam. The United States should recognize, however, that
                            the Korean Government also has a problem in this respect. He said that
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> would recall
                            very well the very great difficulties which had been faced at the time
                            of the despatch of Korean troops to Viet-Nam. These problems, which
                            centered in the National Assembly, had eventually been overcome through
                            close cooperation between himself and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>, but the Opposition remains very
                            hostile to the Korean involvement in Viet-Nam, and unless United States
                            moves regarding troop withdrawal are closely coordinated with the Korean
                            Government, there could be bad political consequences in Korea. The
                            Secretary said that he was fully aware of this problem. He thought it
                            very likely that the meeting of Troop Contributing Countries (<gloss
                                target="#t_TCC1">TCC</gloss>) in Bangkok in May would discuss this
                            matter. He said he thought it had probably always been envisaged that
                            when withdrawal of foreign forces began it would be on some sort of a
                            pro rata basis among the allies.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that, with regard to negotiations on Viet-Nam,
                            the only advice his Government had to the United States was to maintain
                            a strong posture. We should occupy the top of the hill and then
                            negotiate. It was important not to be deceived by communist negotiating
                            tactics but to make the necessary extra effort on the ground in Viet-Nam
                            and to be very patient.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked the Prime Minister what sort of reports he had from
                            the Korean commanders in Viet-Nam. The Prime Minister responded that the
                            reports were excellent. He said that morale was high among Korean forces
                            and he felt they were very effective in their pacification operations.
                            He noted smilingly that he thought yellow people could be more effective
                            in this sort of thing than white people.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that as his final point he would raise the
                            problem of economic cooperation. President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> had set for the Korean people the goal of economic
                            self-sufficiency. This goal was in sight, but the Korean situation might
                            be likened to a period in which a child is just beginning to stand up
                            and walk. It is most essential at this stage to give encouragement and
                            not to disturb the learning process. The <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15"
                                facs="0042"/>Prime Minister pointed out that this development could
                            also be a great benefit to the United States in providing us with a
                            showcase of the effectiveness of our assistance programs. He pointed out
                            the great problems which were raised for Korea by restrictions on

                        <p>The Prime Minister noted the hostility with which the Korean people
                            viewed certain activity by the Japanese, who are extremely prosperous,
                            but who seem to be trying to grab for themselves the benefits of—for
                            example—the economic rehabilitation which will be undertaken in
                            Viet-Nam. This sort of thing the Korean people simply do not understand.
                            He therefore would frankly ask from the United States in economic
                            matters, not merely “equal treatment”, but particularly favorable
                            treatment for Korea. If Korean economic growth can be assured for
                            another five years it will be a much more solid situation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary responded jokingly that he had been informed Secretary of
                            Commerce <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> would be in Korea
                            in the middle of May and he had complete confidence that Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> would be able to solve
                            all of the problems that the Prime Minister had raised. The Prime
                            Minister laughed and said this would be very welcome.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister offered a few farewell courtesies and the meeting
                            concluded.</p>

                            law can be breached. The U.S. became a great nation by breaking
                            international law. The President said we certainly have concluded that

                            game. This was not a regular recon plane, was it? <gloss

                            a deliberate plan to get it. They were moving two Mig 21s which would
                            not signal anything in particular to us about their intentions. The

                            The N.K. sent the ship to the Netherlands and when we made some point

                        <p>President said another option had occurred to him with greater symbolic
                            meaning—a Navy blockade of the one port of significance. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName> said he was sure it could be done.
                            President referred to Cuban blockade<note n="2" xml:id="d9fn2">Reference
                                is to the naval quarantine that the <persName>Kennedy</persName>
                                administration imposed during the Cuban missile crisis in October
                                1962.</note> and said question is how long can it be maintained.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName> said that is the problem.
                            President said he was thinking of the impact. President said people say
                            it does not mean anything, but it means a lot to a lot of people.
                            President said it is good when there is something specific that you want
                            to get done—there is nothing they can do to get the blockade lifted.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName> said except to pay damages.
                            President said that is what he meant—we want that and the return of the
                                <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>. President said it would not take a
                            lot to blockade that place. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName>
                            said on the other hand there is not much going in or out either so it
                            may be an empty gesture. President said they have to live so there is
                            something going in and out. President referred to three Polish ships
                            which have to come in—they could be kept out. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName> said they could unload elsewhere and
                            ship down by rail. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName> said he
                            would have it looked into. President said he wants to get something that
                            has symbolism—that is what we are talking about. President said it could
                            be signal of what we are <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0048"/>going to
                            do down below. President said we could keep it for a few months and then
                            lift it but not say anything. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName>
                            said if they wanted to play it nastily, we could get hit with it every
                            day—harassing us, etc. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName> said he
                            would look at it and give the President pros and cons tomorrow.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName> said he has some more
                            information on ship<note n="3" xml:id="d9fn3">Reference to the tracking
                                of a North Korean ship sailing under Dutch registry, crew, and
                                flag.</note>—it is in the area of Capetown and supposed to reach
                            Hong Kong on April 23 and go on to Korea. Told President about payment
                            breakdown—20% down payment had been made by Koreans and they owe 80%;
                            loan has been guaranteed by Dutch government. President asked about
                            title. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName> said we do not think it
                            has passed, it is still a Dutch ship. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >K</persName> said we would have to compensate the Dutch Government
                            5-1/2 million dollars. President said that is awful small compared to
                            risks taken in other areas. President said there is a lot of symbolism
                            in that.</p>

                            ship. President said throw the blockade one at them too. <persName

                        <p>In addition to the above incidents, Pyongyang has sustained a generally
                            high level of tension along the Demilitarized Zone beginning in late
                            1966. North Korean military personnel have carried out vigorous probing
                            and harassing activity against United Nations Command forces including
                            sabotage of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> military installations,
                            attacks on routine <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and South Korean
                            patrols south of the Military Demarcation line, and in late 1967 the
                            derailment of two South Korean trains south of the Demilitarized
                            Zone.</p>

                        <p>I. North Korea’s armed forces are capable of defending the country
                            against a South Korean attack, and could go on the offensive with
                            outside logistics support. North Korea uses a very large proportion of
                            its manpower and money to maintain and improve its military, and is <pb

                            military establishment is impressive for so small a country, and the

                                probably remains about even, with outside assistance the decisive

                        <p>I know you don’t need more advice on this subject; however, since today’s
                            deliberations may prove critical, I thought I would gratuitously provide
                            some additional thoughts for your consideration and perhaps that of the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>There is one major difference between this incident and the <hi
                                rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident of last year which you can weigh
                            carefully, as it has both positive and negative overtones on the
                            domestic scene. In the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> case, the President
                            had some basis for caution in considering any measures in retaliation
                            for the seizure. That basis, of course, was the welfare of the crewmen.
                            In this incident, similar inhibitions are not available in explaining a
                            “no-action” stance. While in the immediate time frame, this may not
                            constitute an excessively troublesome difference, I strongly suspect
                            that when all of the facts are in, and they certainly must be either
                            through the press and our own revelations or perhaps as a result of a
                            Congressional investigation of the incident, then a “do nothing” stance
                            could well build a substantial head of steam.</p>

                        <p>In the final analysis, however, the decision of the President to respond
                            militarily must be based on his ability and willingness to cope with the
                            worst case response situation. To me, the indicators are simple: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>All factors considered, a military retaliatory strike of some
                                    type is called for.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Fundamental to the calculus of retaliation is our ability to
                                    contain the worst case retaliation by the enemy. This means that
                                    an essential part of today’s program would be a careful analysis
                                    of our posture should the North Koreans initiate ground and/or
                                    air attacks across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> as a
                                    result of our strike. To me, this element is far more
                                    significant than is the configuration of the size of our strike
                                    force. Consequently, I would recommend that we view this with
                                    considerable care at the 3:00 p.m. meeting this afternoon.<note

                                    will not suffice. We must have the capability to contain attacks
                                    with some reasonable assurance of success. More importantly, the
                                    enemy must know that we have this capability and the intent to
                                    use it. This can only be assured by some level of reinforcement
                                    and increased readiness in the theater as well as a demonstrated
                                    willingness to provide whatever may be necessary from domestic
                                    and worldwide resources. While some consider actions of this
                                    type escalatory and threatening, they are rather measures
                                    designed to prevent that very thing. I know you have some
                                    serious doubts about this, but I could not over-emphasize the
                                    difficulties such failures entailed throughout our inching
                                    escalation in Vietnam.</item>

                                <item>If the President is unwilling to trigger all of the signalling
                                    devices at his command to convey his/U.S. intent to go the limit
                                    if required, I would recommend that we not undertake an action
                                    such as an overt attack against the North Korean airfield. In
                                    this event, I would then recommend that we consider the
                                    submarine ambush tactic which I suggested to you yesterday. Such
                                    a tactic might take several days or weeks to execute. It would
                                    certainly constitute a measure of punitive action which would
                                    pose some surprises to the enemy and a great deal of domestic
                                    lard for scorched tempers. Next, I fear our only course of
                                    action would be a repeat mission with fighter escort.</item>

                                crisis. There is one major difference between these two incidents,
                                however, that complicates the problem of developing effective <gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss> responses that would produce the

                                contrast to the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> affair, which
                                contained elements susceptible to negotiation, the present situation
                                does not lend itself to bargaining or exchange. Moreover, the

                                apart from straightforward retaliation, involve the principles of

                                against future such hostilities. Neither principle is particularly

                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss> courses of action is also complicated
                                by the assumptions and motivations underlying North Korea’s action.
                                The <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-sung</persName> regime almost
                                certainly planned this move in advance calculating that the
                                potential advantages in taking this risk far outweighed the dangers
                                of possible <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military reprisals.
                                This judgment, and North Korea’s evaluation of future <gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss> initiatives, probably are strongly
                                influenced by the Korean’s interpretation of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss> response to the seizure of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim
                                    Il-sung</persName> evidently has persuaded himself that the

                                elsewhere and that North Korea therefore can engage in such
                                deliberate acts of defiance with relative impunity. The North
                                Koreans probably <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0060"/>made the

                                military response or at the most only a limited one, in the nature

                            <item>We believe that two main factors contributed to North Korea’s
                                complacent appraisal of risks. <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim
                                    Il-sung</persName>’s style of rule has long been characterized
                                by a willingness to accept risks and by a strong reliance on bluff
                                and intimidation. He has taken pride in his militant “revolutionary”
                                stance and has ridiculed Peking and Moscow for their caution in
                                dealing with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> power. A major theme
                                of North Korean propaganda, particularly since the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Pueblo</hi> incident, is that a determined small nation can
                                defeat a “mighty imperialist.” A more specific motivation for the
                                shootdown probably resides in <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim
                                    Il-sung</persName>’s desire to offset the failure of his
                                attempts over the past two years to launch a so-called “people’s
                                war” in the South and to undermine and disrupt the South Korean
                                government and economy. <persName>Kim</persName>, moreover,
                                evidently believes his long-term ambitions regarding South Korea
                                require a high level of tension with the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                    >US</gloss>. Periodic provocations, he hopes, will contribute to
                                the disillusionment of the American public with overseas burdens and
                                bring about a reduction and eventual withdrawal of <gloss

                            <item>In view of these North Korean assumptions and ambitions, it is
                                doubtful that any of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> courses
                                of action considered below would have any decisive or lasting
                                effects, either in achieving stated <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                    >US</gloss> objectives or in inducing Pyongyang to modify its
                                long-term policies. Embassy Seoul has suggested that if the <gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss> response takes the form of a military
                                threat or even a limited strike, “the benefits to North Korea will
                                be manifold.” A very tough populace will be spurred to greater feats
                                of production and sacrifice, and the disputes within the North
                                Korean leadership that have been hinted at in recent pronouncements
                                may be stilled in the face of tangible external pressure. Such gains
                                for the regime, in the Embassy’s judgment, would outweigh the
                                physical losses anticipated from a limited <gloss target="#t_US1"

                            <item>Military actions not involving combat probably would not deter the

                            they are content with what President is doing—there is no pressure to do
                            anything more. President said he (<persName corresp="#p_LMR1"
                                >Laird</persName>) has been brave soldier—he has taken a lot of heat
                            on these things and you can’t just let State get credit for checking
                            with Congress and being the good guys and <persName corresp="#p_LMR1"
                                >Mel</persName> the bad guy. That is why President asked him to
                            check with them—he understands them and knows what we are trying to do.
                            President asked whether <persName corresp="#p_LMR1">Laird</persName>
                            still thought we had to do this. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"

                                <persName corresp="#p_LMR1">Laird</persName> still believes it is
                            right thing to do but no longer thinks there is Congressional pressure
                            to do it. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName> said he thought
                            Rockefeller would support it but he will check with him. <gloss

                        <p>President said he is still affirmative. He has to be sure we are leading

                            President can take. In long run it may turn out not to be so risky. Pres
                            said when you come right down to it here’s the Soviet Union finally
                            flushing Czech Revolution down the drain and no one gives a damn; here
                            we are on isolated basis and we do not do a <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35"

                            editorial in <hi rend="italic">Star</hi>—he really thinks we should have
                            gotten across the fact there was no question about where plane was.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName> said he (Pres) could nail
                            that down tomorrow. President agreed. <gloss target="#t_P1">P</gloss>
                            said they made check and no question whatever and they know it.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName> said Korean radar showed it
                            was 40 miles off the coast and Russian radar showed 60. They know we are
                            not playing provocation into a crisis. Russians have their hands full in
                            Czech now—they have to be ready for next few days against some riots.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName> said there will be some
                            reaction in the West. President said he doubted Britain, France and the
                            rest would do anything. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName> said
                            there might be some bad editorials against them but they will have their
                            hands full for a few weeks.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName> said if we do this, we have to
                            be ready to go very, very far in case it leads to ground action. I think
                            we can stop if we are willing to look down and that is a very tough one
                            to bite early in Administration and I owe it to you to say that.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName> said his judgment is that
                            it will not come to that.</p>
                        <p>Pres said he trusts <persName corresp="#p_LMR1">Mel</persName> is not
                            backing off. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName> said he is uneasy
                            about it. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName> said if Pres says he
                            wants to do it, <persName corresp="#p_LMR1">Mel</persName> would agree
                            to do and take public responsibility for it. President said <persName

                                corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName> said he believes to do this will make

                        <p>President said take the people on the other side—take

                                >K</persName> said they will say Pres risked another ground war in
                            Asia. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName> said Pres will have to
                            say we will not tolerate another ground war in Asia—to <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> we will have to say more. When
                            it happens, we might have to go to tactical nuclears and clean it up.
                            All hell will break loose for two months, but at end of road there will
                            be peace in Asia. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">K</persName> said that is
                            something that is easy for him to say.</p>
                        <p>Pres discussed press stories—they are not praising us, they are trying to
                            get us to do something. They are eroding self-confidence of this
                            country. President said that is another problem that is not answered by

                            <item>The Korean Decision and Domestic Opinion</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>A fundamental issue on the Korean decision is the problem of mobilizing
                            sustained public support. There are very few direct clues to American
                            opinion on this issue. Up to the present time, the public demands for
                            retaliation have been limited and less vocal than after the <hi
                                rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> seizure. On the other hand, warnings
                            against retaliation have been equally small and come from the expected
                            quarters.</p>
                        <p>It is my guess that a very large segment of the American people would
                            initially welcome a strong response—as an act of strength and
                            self-respect. The problem will be to prevent this support from seriously
                            eroding over a period of weeks. The action will certainly have its
                            minority of dovish critics from the very beginning. It will raise such
                            issues as—why did we react to this incident and not to the shooting down
                            of other reconnaissance planes? Isn’t there a risk of a two-front war in
                            Asia? Why was Congress ignored? etc. They will be playing to an American
                            people who, however enervated by a decisive action, are also essentially
                            fatigued by the Vietnam war, concerns about the growing racial and city
                            crises, taxes, and other domestic problems turning them inward.</p>
                        <p>Even if the action brings no response from the North Koreans, these
                            nagging doubts and concerns will remain and serve as a basis for the
                            “never-again” rationalization—although there will be a great <pb n="38"
                                xml:id="pg_38" facs="0065"/>sense of relief and pride in success. It
                            should also be noted that anticipated overseas criticism will play into
                            the doves’ hands.</p>
                        <p>A crucial question will be the interaction of domestic opinion on the
                            Vietnam war. A strong response in Korea is almost certain to bring the
                            North Vietnamese up short and heighten their concern about the risks of
                            prolonging the Vietnam war. On the other hand, they will be watching
                            even more closely domestic public opinion in the U.S.—which they
                            consider their trump card in outlasting us at the peace negotiations.
                            The initial shock effect on Hanoi could well be lost if there is a
                            serious erosion of domestic support for the Korean action leading to
                            renewed pressures against the Vietnam commitment.</p>
                        <p>This then is the risk of the Korean action. But, it must be evaluated
                            against the risk of inaction. American opinion is volatile and difficult
                            to judge at this time. I can only guess and that guess is that it will
                            not give sustained support for the Korean action because too many will
                            conclude that U.S. vital national interests were not engaged, as they
                            were in the Cuban missile crisis, sufficiently to justify the risks of
                            renewed hostilities in Korea.</p>

                                    some justification for the “massive” impression. A strike
                                    involving B–52s could well be less acceptable in the eyes of

                                    the loss of smaller attack aircraft will be more palatable (in

                                <item>• I have the feeling a U.S. attack which would be interpreted
                                    as mainly for the purpose of punishing the North Koreans, could
                                    be akin to incidents which plagued the last two Administrations,
                                    i.e., the episode that didn’t have to be, that carried far more
                                    risks than the potential pay-off would seem to dictate, and that
                                    led to general public disenchantment across a broad range of
                                    affairs. If, for example, we take losses during the strike, the
                                    question will be raised about losing more life to vindicate
                                    original losses. If, for example, we become involved in a more
                                    extended fracas at a time when the public is not heavily in
                                    favor of things military, the impact <hi rend="italic"
                                        >against</hi> the Administration on a wide front could be
                                    damaging to a high degree. If, for example, the Soviets decide
                                    not to proceed with strategic talks—as we postponed such talks
                                    in the wake of Czechoslovakia—the U.S. public clamor could be
                                    likewise damaging.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>I wonder if we should take the chance. I believe the carrier-based strike
                            against North Korean airfields is least risky among the military
                            options. But I believe the risks even there outweigh the potential
                            benefits by a substantial margin.</p>

                            meeting and gave him general outline of our intentions, which was all
                            that was possible because we had not yet received final text of

                            counterblow that they cannot count on continued patience and restraint
                            as they pursue their aggressive policy, or we can give up our right to

                            urged Vance and me to agree to a strong warning to North Koreans that
                            any additional incident would bring immediate retaliation, but we had
                            refused to go along with that idea and as result <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> has this new incident to deal with. I commented that
                            there were some additional factors which affect our attitude toward this
                            problem. No one could say in advance what kind of immediate retaliation
                            would be called for and it does not seem at all desirable simply to
                            react without careful thought and consultation. Moreover, everyone knows
                            that we could strike North Koreans and that they do not have the power
                            to strike back at United States. This made it inevitable that their
                            counterblow would probably escalate matters considerably because it
                            would be against Republic of Korea, perhaps cities or major
                            installations. At this point President was silent for awhile. He then
                            said he nevertheless wished to convey to President <persName

                            all that significant. What he had in mind to say was just the facts—that
                            we have run these flights many times, they have been completely unarmed,
                            they have been well outside the territorial limits, he has ordered a
                            continuation of the flights and will take whatever steps are necessary
                            to see that they are protected.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_HAK1">HAK</gloss> thought it would most certainly be
                            read as an end to it. The President said suppose it is. <gloss
                                target="#t_HAK1">HAK</gloss> said maybe some of the President’s
                            supporters would also think this. The reason they are quiet on the Hill
                            is that they don’t want to get ahead of the President. The President
                            said if we crack it on Monday he will still get the supporters to come
                            along. <gloss target="#t_HAK1">HAK</gloss> agreed.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_P1">P</gloss> said he would use the phrase “he
                            would use whatever action is determined to be necessary” and wondered if
                                <gloss target="#t_HAK1">HAK</gloss> had any <pb n="45"
                                xml:id="pg_45" facs="0072"/>problems with that. <gloss
                                target="#t_HAK1">HAK</gloss> said no but in that case he posed two
                            additional questions. If the question is asked whether this same flight
                            has been flown since the incident the answer would be no since they will
                            not fly another pattern of this kind for another two weeks. On the other
                            hand, we do have another plane standing by. The <gloss target="#t_P1"
                                >P</gloss> said whether we do option 2 or not, we would do that. He
                            would keep these flights on the same pattern. The President said he is
                            not trying to provoke so no special missions would be set up. If the
                            question is asked whether that means a flight will be in the area, the
                            answer is that it will be in that area whenever it comes up on its

                            Korea morale in South Korea will be reduced.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said we shall have
                            these factors in mind in our decisions on subsequent steps. It is his
                            policy never to threaten but the North Koreans are on notice.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> suggested three steps to
                            deter the North Koreans. First, we should let the North Koreans know if
                            they repeat the <gloss target="#t_EC1211">EC–121</gloss> shoot-down it
                            will suffer retaliatory action. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                            >Park</persName>’s views on <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il
                                Sung</persName>’s intentions. He said some believe that
                                <persName>Kim</persName> actually wants a fight at this time.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> said that
                                <persName>Kim</persName> has built up his forces to war-time level
                            and North Korea is a military camp. South Korea on the other hand is
                            geared to economic development, improvement of its national power and
                            unification by peaceful means. It does not have enough forces to resist
                            the North. The North Koreans may miscalculate therefore and start a
                            conflict in the belief that the U.S. would not fight in Korea due to its
                            involvement in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> went on to describe the two
                            other necessary deterrence steps. The second action should be to build
                            up U.S. air power in South Korea since there is still too great a
                            disparity in favor of the North Koreans. South Korea hoped that the U.S.
                            would keep at least a task force in the area. Finally, <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> said that most important would be
                            to strengthen the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces,
                            particularly its air force. The principal North Korean military margin
                            is in air power; South Korea has good pilots and if it had the
                            equipment, it would have a first-rate air force. The <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is now preparing a plan to discuss with
                            General Bonesteel for gradual buildup of the South Korean forces.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> suggested that
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> discuss this with
                            Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_LMR1">Laird</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> assured President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> that Korea wishes to maintain its
                            traditional friendship with the United States. He described President
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> as courageous and
                            restrained. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said
                            that he appreciated Korean restraint and knew it was difficult for the
                            Koreans. Korea could be assured that the U.S. and Korea would always
                            stand together.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> then raised several other
                            issues with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>.
                            First, with respect to Okinawa, Korea had no wish to be involved in this
                            question but is concerned since Okinawa protects Korea as well as other
                            countries. Korea therefore wants to be consulted on its disposition.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said no decision
                            had been made but we will talk to the Koreans.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> said that U.S. assistance to
                            Korea is now showing fruits and after 1971 they will not need grant aid.
                            Korea is following a policy of growth, stability and solvency. Korea
                            will need increased trade, however. Its exports have increased from $30
                            million to $500 million last <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0076"
                            />year. The most important market for Korea is the United States and its
                            major export is textiles. It is therefore concerned about efforts to
                            control textile imports into the United States. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said we would certainly have the
                            Korean problems in mind but the textile question is a difficult problem
                            for the United States. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SMH1"
                                >Stans</persName> will be talking to the Korean Government on trade

                        <p>Thank you for your note of April 8 introducing Deputy Prime Minister Park
                            and for your letter of April 26 which the Deputy Prime Minister
                            delivered to me. I had a most useful and pleasant discussion with
                                him.<note n="2" xml:id="d25fn2">See <ref target="#d21fn2">Document
                                    21 and footnote 2</ref> thereto. Copies of the two letters are
                                attached to <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>’s
                                letter.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>As Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> has already
                            told you, I am glad that you consider the actions which I have taken in
                            response to the unprovoked shooting down of the <gloss
                                target="#t_EC1211">EC–121</gloss> over international waters to be
                            wise and appropriate. I am most grateful for the support expressed both
                            in your letter and in the public statements of officials of your
                            government.</p>
                        <p>I agree with your view that one of North Korea’s motives is to try to
                            drive a wedge between the United States and the Republic of Korea.
                            Thanks to the spirit of the Korean people and the close harmony between
                            our two governments, these efforts have totally failed. I want to assure
                            you of my personal dedication to strengthening the bonds between our two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>I am very much aware of the military capabilities of the North Korean
                            regime and the threatening attitude of their leaders. I share your
                            concern about it. I was therefore glad to get your views on ways to meet
                            this continuing threat. I will keep them very much in mind and can
                            assure you that they will receive most serious consideration by my
                            Administration.</p>
                        <p>As you know, United States tactical air forces in Korea were
                            substantially strengthened after the attempted raid on the Blue House
                            and the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident, and other measures have
                            been taken to strengthen our defenses.</p>
                        <p>I look forward to your visit in August, when it will be possible for us
                            to explore our mutual interests and problems together at length.</p>
                        <p>With warm regards,</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> that future attacks will not go

                        <p>The United States is at a turning point with respect to Korea. A number
                            of major policy decisions are in the offing which could alter
                            fundamentally the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Korea relationship.
                            These decisions could be made individually, as circumstances demand,
                            with a view toward stabilizing our current policy, which centers on
                            direct employment of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces.
                            Alternatively, taking cognizance of the growing strength of Korea and
                            other Asian countries, our actions vis-à-vis Korea could indicate a
                            policy of increased Asian self-reliance, at least for lesser-power
                            conflicts. Either way, the high cost implications and the strong
                            interactions between various programs—<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>

                                >US</gloss> Policy</p>
                        <p>There are reasons for viewing Korea with optimism. Since 1963, when the
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> government was ratified
                            by a close vote, Korea has seen steady improvements in economic
                            performance, military strength, political effectiveness, and
                            international stature. The economy has grown by some ten percent per
                            year, inflation has been controlled, and exports have surged.
                            Improvements in military capabilities have been confirmed by the strong
                            performance of the two <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions in
                            Vietnam; the country’s first expeditionary force provides evidence that
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces might well assume a
                            larger defense role at home, at least against North Korean attacks. The
                            growing confidence of the regime was also demonstrated in 1965 by the
                            “normalization” of Korean relations with Japan. <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> contributions to the <gloss target="#t_SVN1"
                                >SVN</gloss> conflict, combined with Korea’s progress on a broad
                            front, have served to shift Korea’s relationship with the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> from dependence toward partnership.</p>
                        <p>Despite these developments, for some observers <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s handling of his 1967 re-election
                            suggests that Korea had not matured politically. <pb n="67"
                                xml:id="pg_67" facs="0094"/>Though assured of victory over a weak
                            opposition, the <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> regime
                            discredited itself by visible election irregularities. Moreover, with
                            victory in hand, the regime took repressive measures against the
                            opposition leadership. If this tendency continues, the 1971 presidential
                            election may become a major test of the South Korean political system:
                            It could result in a constitutional amendment permitting a third-term
                            bid by President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>, an orderly
                            transfer of power to a successor, or abandonment of the constitutional
                            process.</p>
                        <p>Another factor of concern is the stance of North Korea. The stated
                            political objective of the North is to reunify the Korean peninsula
                            under a Communist regime. To achieve this objective, North Korean
                            Premier <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim-Il Sung</persName> appears
                            committed to a strategy of “revolutionary struggle” in South Korea, and
                            his campaign will probably continue to include harassment of the <gloss
                                target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> area and armed infiltration of rear
                            areas. However, because of the strength of the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1"
                                >ROKG</gloss>, the consensus is that North Korea is unlikely to
                            establish guerrilla bases in South Korea or to develop significant
                            political support among the people. Nevertheless, the self-confidence of
                            the Korean government and the confidence it gains from the people will
                            depend substantially upon success in coping with incursions from the
                            North.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the most important element affecting <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss>/Korea programs is the evolving <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> role in Asia. Neo-isolationist sentiment in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has given rise to doubts about the
                            long-run <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> commitment to Asian security.
                            The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> response to the <gloss
                                target="#t_EC1211">EC–121</gloss> incident failed to reassure the
                            Koreans on the firmness of future <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            reactions to North Korean affronts. The impending renegotiation of the
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> security treaty with Japan and its
                            possible implications for the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military
                            posture in Okinawa add to the uncertainty. Korea may also feel
                            uncomfortable with its dependence upon <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            decisions in Vietnam for the vindication of its first regional security
                            undertaking. This line of questioning assumes increased importance when
                            it is recognized that the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> will
                            remain heavily dependent on the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> for

                            programs. The goals are: (1) To prevent large-scale North-South
                            hostilities; (2) To maintain a stable compromise among the great powers
                            with interests in Korea; (3) To keep South Korea out of hostile hands;
                            (4) To increase <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> ability to defend
                            itself; (5) To promote South Korea’s economic development and political
                            stability; (6) To encourage Japan to make a greater contribution to the

                            jeopardizing economic development, political stability, or an increased
                            Japanese role in Korea.</p>
                        <p>There are many ways to meet these goals. In this analysis program
                            alternatives have been developed for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>

                            useful in providing a conceptual framework and giving coherence to
                            program decisions. We have called these alternative program packages
                            “policy continuity” and “accelerated self-reliance.” Both are based on
                            the same evidence, but the emphasis given to certain factors has been
                            changed. Each is a way of viewing the current situation in all its
                            complexity. Each has been presented in its most favorable aspect with a
                            tone of advocacy.</p>

                            on the need for updated and effective procedures for contingency
                            planning, having in mind documents which would be useful for incidents
                            similar to the <gloss target="#t_EC1211">EC–121</gloss> “shoot down”.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said he envisioned

                            responsibilities. Moreover he wished it to be clearly understood that
                            actual operations during contingencies would not be run from the White
                            House Situation Room. What has to be done now is to develop ways of
                            interfacing military and political considerations and to answer the
                            question “who does what”? He noted that military plans for contingencies
                            are highly sensitive and that, for <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss>
                            actions, only the principals should have access to the documents. They
                            would not be reproduced and would be returned to the Joint Staff after
                            having been worked in the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss>.
                            Ultimately, what will be required are contingency folders, approved by
                            the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss>, then kept on file in the
                            White House Situation Room for use in possible emergencies. He then
                            asked the group members for their comments.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> immediately
                            called to mind the comparison between the Berlin Task Force and the
                            Korean Task Force under Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1"
                                >Brown</persName>, which has prepared a plan for Korean
                            contingencies in response to <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 34.
                            He commended this plan to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> saying that it covers much of the same ground
                            as the “Red Books” sent to the Group by the Joint Staff. He remarked on
                            the effectiveness of the “Live Oak” plans done by the Berlin Task Force.
                            This is an on-going operation which has produced plans in great detail
                            and with an underlying concept that the planning group would also be
                            deeply involved in the emergency actions incident to Berlin
                            contingencies. He stated that with respect to the Korean Task Force,
                            much valuable work has already been done. What should now be done is to
                            refine the work under the direction of the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1"
                                >WSAG</gloss> serving as a “Watch Dog” committee. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> remarked that the President
                            was not telling the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> how to
                            organize, but that he desires the group to provide plans which will give
                            him the same kind of assurance that he had during the <gloss
                                target="#t_EC1211">EC–121</gloss> incident.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> stated that the
                            Korean Task Force work is now ready to be looked at by the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Review Group. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> rejoined that the plan should
                            not be handled by the Review Group but by the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1"
                                >WSAG</gloss>. He did not believe the Review Group could address the
                            problems with the same precision that the President needs for decision
                            making in contingency situations. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_JNC1"
                                >Johnson</persName> concurred, stating that the military aspects of
                            the contingency plans are highly sensitive and that the security aspects
                            of these plans are of paramount importance. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> added that whether the plan would eventually
                            appear on the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Agenda was a decision
                            the President would have to make at a later date.</p>
                        <p>Turning to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_JNC1">Johnson</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked whether the
                            military participated in the Korean contingency plan. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_JNC1">Johnson</persName> said that they had but he was
                            not sure to what extent. He thought the document reflected military
                            planning in outline form but not in the detail contained <pb n="71"
                                xml:id="pg_71" facs="0098"/>in the “Red Books” before the members.
                            He then reported an exercise internal to the Joint Staff which resulted
                            in a “Crisis Data Book”. This effort visualized hypothetical contingency
                            situations, how they could develop, predicted the reactions of other
                            affected countries, then postulated reasonable <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> actions and their consequences.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> returned to the
                            President’s objectives with respect to contingency plans. The President
                            wants, he said, no generalized statements, but instead courses of action
                            which would be useful in specific situations. For example, if he wants
                            three B–52s to strike a designated objective, what else would he have to
                            do. He is interested in knowing the possible reactions of affected
                            people and governments. What exactly is likely to happen in a
                            political/military sense? He wants a check list of what he has to do—not
                            esoteric speculation about events that could lead to a crisis.
                            Additionally, follow-on factors have to be considered such as how to
                            deal with reinforcement levels. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"
                                >Johnson</persName> opined there was a need to amplify the
                            contingency scenarios. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            reflected on his own thought processes during the <gloss
                                target="#t_EC1211">EC–121</gloss> incident and remarked that his
                            initial reactions were probably naive. The main lesson he learned from
                            the incident was that the trick in any action taken would be to preclude
                            a counter blow. He reported some after-thoughts the President had on the
                                <gloss target="#t_EC1211">EC–121</gloss> incident to the effect that
                            if such an occasion arose in the future and a B–52 strike was believed
                            necessary, the price you pay really isn’t much greater for a strike with
                            twenty-five aircraft than with three. The need is to look determined
                            and, if the object is to prevent counter-responses, the action taken
                            should be a powerful blow. If a similar situation were to arise today,
                            he (the President) would probably either do nothing or select an option
                            toward the extreme of the range of possibilities. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_JNC1">Johnson</persName> said that he agreed with the
                            President’s ideas as do the Joint Chiefs. For example, if you attack an
                            airfield but don’t take out the enemy’s air order of battle, you are in
                            deep trouble.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGW1">Nutter</persName> suggested a parallel
                            between the President’s philosophy and Golda Meir’s “A Seven-fold
                            Retaliation” policy. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"
                                >Johnson</persName> said that the military aspects had to be
                            balanced by an understanding of their political implications. For
                            example, when would we expect the Soviet Union to become involved? We
                            had the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and the <gloss target="#t_EC1211"
                                >EC–121</gloss> incidents but the next time it might be the
                            political assassination of a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            Ambassador or the President of South Korea, or it might be the
                            destruction of a vital industrial facility such as an oil refinery.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> thought that if any
                            of the contingencies mentioned by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"
                                >Johnson</persName> were to occur today the President would probably
                            take positive action.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then turned the
                            attention of the group to the “Red Books” containing representative
                            military contingency plans for Korea. He expressed an opinion that it
                            would be non-productive for the group to review each of the 25 plans in
                            the book. There was basically a great <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72"
                                facs="0099"/>similarity among the plans, and that probably what
                            should be done would be to group them within categories of response. For
                            instance, [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_JNC1">Johnson</persName> then displayed a
                            graphic prepared by the Joint Staff—a map on which was marked the
                            objectives of the 25 plans contained in the “Red Book”. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> remarked that [<hi
                                rend="italic">4 lines not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> then asked how
                            the Group proposed to work the problem at hand? He suggested that the
                            Korean Task Force work be referred to <gloss target="#t_WSAG1"
                                >WSAG</gloss> and not to the Review Group. Additionally, he thought
                            it advisable that members of <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> look
                            carefully at the Korean Task Force plan in preparation for the next
                            meeting. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed with
                            the two courses of action but suggested that the Joint Staff also work
                            on the “Red Books” to group the contingencies by challenges and
                            responses. He inquired whether the work could be done within a week?
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_JNC1">Johnson</persName> thought this was
                            possible. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>
                            remarked that the “Red Books” contained no treatment of the political
                            aspects of the various courses of actions suggested in them. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_JNC1">Johnson</persName> agreed and said it
                            was not their purpose to address the political issues. All members
                            agreed there was a need for expanded scenarios to include their
                            political ramifications.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> thought there
                            was an additional requirement to examine the steps, from a
                            political-military standpoint, that could be taken to confine the
                            actions to a low level. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_JNC1"
                                >Johnson</persName> remarked that a <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                                >CIA</gloss> assessment of possible enemy reactions would be needed.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said he wanted
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> in on the act.
                            (It was not clear whether he meant representation on the <gloss
                                target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> or whether he meant in <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>’s capacity as head of the Korean
                            Task Force.) The group agreed that, with the work in front of them,
                            frequent meetings would be required.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> stated that, of
                            all possible contingencies, Berlin problems had been dealt with more
                            extensively than any of the others. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_JNC1"
                                >Johnson</persName> remarked that no plan, however detailed, is any
                            good if it is static. All contingency plans must undergo periodic
                            review. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> agreed
                            and recommended a standing Task Force working continuously, but not
                            necessarily on a day-to-day basis, within each of the contingency areas.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Meyer</persName> asked about the
                            membership of the Korean Task Force? Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> then gave a rundown of the task
                            force membership under Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1"
                                >Brown</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            said he has no objection to the task force concept provided they have
                            access to the kind of material necessary to work the problems
                            effectively. Under any circumstances, he considered the <gloss
                                target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> as the proper reviewing authority for
                            the type of planning being considered by the group. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_JNC1">Johnson</persName> said it would be possible for
                            the military to provide detailed <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0100"
                            />briefings, giving the necessary background information, but omitting
                            unnecessary operational detail.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then inquired about the
                            level of activity of the Berlin Task Force. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said that its structure and
                            mechanics were still in existence but that its recent activities have
                            been limited. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated
                            his belief that, because of the pressure of other duties, the <gloss
                                target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> cannot function as a planning group
                            but only as a reviewing agency.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> then said the
                            Korean Task Force plan was on its way but he was not really certain of
                            its status within the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> reporting
                            process.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that for the next
                            meeting the Joint Staff should attempt to group the plans in the “Red
                            Books” and that the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> should be
                            prepared to discuss what kinds of provocations would lead to what kinds
                            of responses.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> then outlined
                            the six general contingency areas set forth in the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 34 study.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> remarked that, if the
                            work of the Korean Task Force fits the objectives defined by the <gloss
                                target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss>, the work should be used and people
                            should not have to do it over again. After the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1"
                                >WSAG</gloss> looks over the Korean Task Force plan, the Korean Task
                            Force could then be used as a Working Group for the <gloss
                                target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> to make whatever revisions will be
                            required. Similarly, when Berlin contingencies are considered in the
                            very near future the Berlin Task Force can assume responsibility for
                            follow-on work. Moreover, because contingency planning is underway for
                            the Middle East there is a need for a similar Task Force to handle those
                            problems. He noted that the military contingency plans which deal with a
                            confrontation with the Soviet Union in the Middle East are somewhat
                            unrelated to politics and seem to be deficient in the logistic
                            arrangements that are called for. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_JNC1"
                                >Johnson</persName> replied that the military plans for the Middle
                            East are undergoing revision at the present time and that part of the
                            problem in making sense out of logistic requirements is the lack of
                            military bases in the area.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then asked whether the
                            next <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> meeting could be held on the
                            11th of July. The agenda would be the Korean Task Force plan. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGW1">Nutter</persName> remarked that the members should
                            also consider that plans other than those for the Middle East, Berlin,
                            and Korea would probably be required. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> agreed, but said that further
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> directives were unnecessary
                            because the current general instructions for contingency planning are
                            sufficiently comprehensive. <persName corresp="#p_NGW1"
                                >Nutter</persName> stated that there are grave problems associated
                            with Berlin planning because of the tripartite and quadripartite
                            character of those plans. There are very difficult security problems and
                            almost insurmountable military problems. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> agreed that the Berlin plans
                            were immensely complicated and represented years of work.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> recalled his
                            participation in a 1961 Berlin War Game.<note n="5" xml:id="d28fn5">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had served as a
                                consultant on security matters to President John Kennedy.</note> The
                            results of that game were comforting because they indicated we could not
                            lose. Now the situation is somewhat different. He further questioned
                            what we would do in the event of actual hostilities between the Soviet
                            Union and Communist China. He noted that the President had inquired
                            about this problem earlier in the morning. Early answers to this
                            question are needed.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> to see what could be
                            done bureaucratically to set up a Middle East planning element.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> replied that he
                            would look into what has been done in Middle East planning in the recent
                            past and under the former administration. He will report his findings to
                            the Group at their next meeting. All agreed that, subject to the
                            President’s schedule, the next meeting will be held on Friday, July 11th
                            at 1400 hours.</p>
                        <p>The meeting was adjourned at 12:28 P.M.</p>

                        <p>The meeting began at 2:13 P.M. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"

                            the State–Defense meeting of the previous day. Its purpose was to review
                            the work done by the Joint Staff in grouping the various military plans
                            into categories of response (called for at the last <gloss

                            for decision makers. Because much of the work on the probable nature of
                                <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> provocation has been done in the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 34 Study, the follow-on effort
                            should concentrate on building scenarios for various levels of military
                            response without too much regard for how the particular contingency
                            would arise. This work could be done by a Working Group under Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>, with representation
                            appointed by the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> principals.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> remarked that what the
                            “rump session” had concluded was coincident with his own thoughts. He
                            would not, therefore, have to take the time of the Group by critiquing
                            the <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 34 Study (which he regards as
                            an excellent foundation document) in order to express the same
                            conclusions with respect to an approach to the problem of providing the
                            President with useful options in the event of another Korean
                            emergency.</p>
                        <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0103"/>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_JNC1">Johnson</persName> clarified what he
                            sees to be the working arrangement—a small ad hoc group responsible to
                            the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> as opposed to a <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss>
                            effort. All agreed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that the Working
                            Group should not concern itself with recommendations about when and why
                            a particular plan should be implemented. All that is called for is a set
                            of options including at the one extreme “surgical strikes”, heavy
                            military involvement at the other extreme, with in-between options such
                            as attack against several airfields. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_JNC1"
                                >Johnson</persName> noted that diplomatic maneuverings were, of
                            course, related but a thing apart and not germane to the task at hand.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> remarked that
                            the work on the scenarios would be eased by the nature of the problem
                            itself. When a specific course of action is selected for development,
                            that course then logically dictates what must be done to carry it out.
                            He visualized the end-product as a sequence of events similar to that
                            produced during the <gloss target="#t_EC1211">EC–121</gloss>
                            incident.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> cautioned that a
                            philosophical attachment to one class of response—be it minimum,
                            intermediate, or maximum violence—often tends to cloud contingency
                            plans. What we need are scenarios for the decision-makers. They will
                            have to exercise their responsibility to choose the appropriate level of
                            response from among a group of options.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the plan of action, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"
                                >Johnson</persName> suggested a “plan a week” approach—for example,
                            the next <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> meeting should look at
                            the “surgical” strike category, with the other options following at
                            weekly intervals. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            agreed and standardized future meeting times—Fridays at 2:00 P.M. There
                            were no dissents.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> conjectured that if the
                            President had, today, to select a response to a provocation similar to
                            those of recent history, he would probably pick an intermediate
                            option—say, [<hi rend="italic">8 lines not declassified</hi>]. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_JNC1">Johnson</persName> thought the attacks
                            should be regarded as punitive, and that they would not result in
                            permanent damage.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> inquired how an attack
                            against [<hi rend="italic">4 lines not declassified</hi>]. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> inquired about other
                            “nerve-center” targets. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            asked <persName corresp="#p_MC1">Cord Meyer</persName> to identify a
                            number of these targets and to report them to the <gloss
                                target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> by 15 July. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MC1">Meyer</persName> agreed to do so. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGW1">Nutter</persName> brought up a point relating to
                            international law, citing a body of opinion which holds that the target
                            must somehow be related to the “crime”. In other words, if you get hit
                                <hi rend="italic">from</hi> an airfield, you have to attack an
                            airfield in response. At this point Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> asked what one is really after
                            in striking [<hi rend="italic">9 lines not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_JNC1">Johnson</persName> raised the
                            question of format, noting that the work his staff had done for him this
                            past week was perhaps too detailed. The consensus of the Group was that
                            the <gloss target="#t_EC1211">EC–121</gloss> sequence of events is a
                            good model.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_JNC1">Johnson</persName> returned to
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>’s earlier
                            evaluation of the <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 34 Study. He
                            concurred in the evident merit of the work and <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77"
                                facs="0104"/>hoped that the Korean Task Force would keep it up to
                            date. All agreed that the <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 34
                            Study—and all other <gloss target="#t_IG1">IG</gloss> plans—should be
                            periodically reviewed and made current.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> departed at this point
                            after being informed that his <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss>

                                tensions in South Korea are acute and growing. <persName

                                decision. For him to run would require passage of a constitutional
                                amendment and there is strong opposition to such a move even within
                                some circles of the ruling party.</item>

                            <item>Passage of the amendment requires a two-thirds vote of the
                                National Assembly followed by majority approval in a popular
                                referendum. The first step is likely to be the most difficult.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Pak</persName>’s supporters are
                                conducting an intensive campaign of pressures and inducements to
                                line up the necessary National Assembly votes, but it may prove a
                                    <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0105"/>close thing. If the
                                amendment is passed by the Assembly, the government can probably
                                arrange to secure a majority for it in the referendum, though at
                                this stage too it might feel compelled to use heavy manipulation to
                                assure success.</item>

                            <item>The most serious source of trouble for the regime is likely to
                                come from the students—whose potential for disruption has been
                                clearly demonstrated before and who largely oppose amending the
                                Constitution. Student disorders can probably be handled by security
                                forces, but serious and prolonged turmoil might seriously test the
                                latter’s reliability.</item>

                                    >Pak</persName> probably has at least an even chance of gaining
                                a third term. But events could easily take other turns: if student
                                or other resistance proves strong enough, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PCH1">Pak</persName> might decide not to run,
                                especially since he could designate a successor candidate. Whoever
                                runs as the ruling party’s nominee would probably win, though in a
                                completely free election an opposition victory is conceivable.
                                Should it occur, the regime and the army would be tempted to retain
                                control by force; their decision would depend heavily on <persName

                            <item>The contest in South Korea is essentially a struggle over
                                political power rather than over particular domestic or foreign
                                policies. The opposition leaders are as opposed to North Korea’s
                                pretensions as is the administration, and equally aware of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>’s essential dependence for

                                political question is whether South Korea’s fledgling constitutional

                                whether the government’s desire to keep control, and its fear that
                                political turmoil would benefit North Korea, will lead it to
                                heavy-handed suppression of its opponents.</item>

                                    >Choi</persName>, Secretary noted that <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                    >US</gloss> is very sympathetic to Korean point of view.
                                    Moreover,<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Congress takes a very
                                favorable attitude. Therefore, Korea had no grounds for fear that
                                    <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interest or support is waning.
                                Nevertheless, we must recognize public and Congressional feeling
                                that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is somewhat over-extended
                                abroad to the detriment of domestic needs. This attitude is derived
                                in large part from the Vietnam situation. As a result <gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss> may not be able to do everything that
                                Korea would like, but Korea remains at the top of list and
                                Secretary’s visit underscores our support. Secretary added that he
                                would have further chance to discuss these issues with <persName

                                commitments from time to time. Meanwhile, it was important for Korea

                        <p>Before undertaking a page-by-page discussion of the draft, the group
                            agreed that additional target options are needed. <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the Joint Staff will develop these
                            options which will include airfields, power plants and power
                            distribution facilities, and key industrial plants. Two or three
                            examples within each target category will be selected and arranged in
                            order of military priority.</p>
                        <p>During the discussion of the draft, at the point in the sequence of
                            events when a Presidential decision is made, I remarked that I <pb
                                n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0109"/>considered the paper to be
                            deficient on two counts: (1) the particular decision is postulated
                            (attack on the North Korean air order of battle) without a statement of
                            rationale behind the decision and (2) there is insufficient treatment of
                            the possible risks associated with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            response. My suggestion that these deficiencies be remedied was not well
                            taken. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> stated
                            that these are considerations appropriate for the members of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> in their development of recommendations
                            for the President. I said that if the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1"
                                >WSAG</gloss> principals thought it unnecessary to set out the pros
                            and cons of the various options, the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            staff would have to do so because of the need to (1) cover as much
                            groundwork as is possible on a pre-crisis basis and (2) insure to the
                            extent possible, that nothing is overlooked once a crisis develops.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> replied
                            (somewhat irrelevantly I thought) that the work should be done through
                            “normal staff procedures.” To an extent, my criticisms were later
                            accommodated when the group agreed (1) to call for a draft point paper
                            in which the President would set forth the rationale behind his decision
                            and (2) to amplify the concluding section of the paper by adding a
                            catalog of possible <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>, Soviet and <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> responses, with matching guidance in
                            the form of suggested <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> “rules of
                            engagement.”</p>
                        <p>The paper was strengthened in two important areas. First, the language
                            was modified throughout to leave no doubt that the response selected
                            would be a “time-phased” operation—that is, carried out through a series
                            of strikes over a period of days. Second, <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> initiatives in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            were made more meaningful by broaching the subject of a <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> response to a call for cease-fire. (The
                            group agreed that if bilateral negotiations indicated the Soviets could
                            “deliver” the North Koreans with a high degree of assurance, the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> should respond favorably to a cease-fire
                            proposal.)</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> had reservations
                            about two aspects of the paper. He was, in the first instance, disturbed
                            by a statement in the introductory section which states that <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military action could be provoked by
                            “firm intelligence indicating a large scale North Korean attack is
                            imminent.” Although he recognized the legitimacy of a <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> response to a North Korean military
                            action, he doubted that we would act on receipt of intelligence, however
                            unequivocal it might be.</p>
                        <p>The second area of concern to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"
                                >Johnson</persName> was the business of command relationships in the
                            area. What he appeared to be seeking was assurance that we could look to
                            one military commander in the Western Pacific to assume responsibility
                            for executing a military response to a North Korean provocation. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_JNC1">Johnson</persName> said that the problem
                            is very complex, but reported that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                >JCS</gloss> have tasked <gloss target="#t_COMUSJAPAN1"
                                >COMUSJAPAN</gloss> (who is also CG, Fifth Air Force) to maintain
                            within his situation room current readiness information on military
                            forces in the area that could be called upon to respond in time of
                            emergency. <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0110"/>This did not alleviate
                            the Secretary’s concern because he is aware that <gloss

                            operational control over all of the units that could be involved. His
                            apprehension was obviously generated, at least in part, by the charges
                            made in the recent report of the Pike Committee on the <hi rend="italic"

                            incidents.</p>
                        <p>After completion of the discussion of the Korean paper, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> charged Ambassador

                            depend upon the delivery aircraft, tactical aircraft having a lower
                            circular error probable (CEP) than B–52’s. The whole effort would take
                            from three to four days.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> wondered about the
                            probability of success. <persName corresp="#p_NGW1">Nutter</persName>
                            thought that a figure of 50% would be about right.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> suggested that the next
                            Korean scenario should be an adaptation of what has already been done,
                            but with an objective selected from the non-airfield category. He
                            questioned whether the diplomatic effort would fit for either an
                            airfield strike or one against a power plant. He recalled that both had
                            been considered during the <gloss target="#t_EC1211">EC–121</gloss>
                            incident and that some aspects of each seemed to differ at the time.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> thought the
                            work done to date could accommodate virtually any kind of target with
                            only minor modifications to the diplomatic scenario. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then asked if a different
                            military plan would be needed for each category of target. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_JNC1">Johnson</persName> replied to the
                            contrary, saying that all that is needed is to set a military priority
                            for the various targets under consideration. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> pursued his line of thought, seeking assurance
                            that a basic scenario would fit multiple target situations. He wants to
                            avoid a situation where the President would order a response in 48
                            hours, only to be told it would take from 48 to 72 hours to build a
                            plan. <persName corresp="#p_NGW1">Nutter</persName> and Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_JNC1">Johnson</persName> assured him such
                            would not be the case—for example in a “surgical strike”, only one
                            scenario would be needed regardless of the target. In all cases the
                            timing would be about the same. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> wanted to know if the strike forces would
                            leave stand-by plans covering the targets selected by the <gloss
                                target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss>. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_JNC1"
                                >Johnson</persName> replied affirmatively, the targets will go to
                            the field as soon as the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss>
                            authorizes release. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            then asked whether we would have options insofar as delivery units are
                            concerned. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_JNC1">Johnson</persName>
                            assured him we would. Either tactical air or B–52’s could be used.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> remarked that
                            naval strikes would depend on the location of the carrier task
                            force.</p>
                        <p>The group directed their attention to the first scenario prepared by the
                            Working Group. Some confusion existed because only <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KTH1">Karamessines</persName> held the most recent
                            editions of the draft. Colonel <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0113"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAM1">Haig</persName> solved the problem by
                            providing a common document for all to use.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> summarized with a
                            statement of requirements for all scenarios except large-scale attack
                            against the <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_AOB1">AOB</gloss>: (1) complete pre-planning so that
                            only execution delays would be involved; (2) alternative force options
                            with timing for each option. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_JNC1"
                                >Johnson</persName> noted that the plans would be good only for the
                            present force posture. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            acknowledged this to be true and said that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                >JCS</gloss> will be responsible for amending the plans to reflect
                            existing conditions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> what should be done
                            next. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>
                            re-directed the group’s attention to the heavy response scenario,
                            stating that he had no problems with the sequence of events. The concept
                            of the first part of the paper is to mesh the actions of all of the
                            agencies concerned. Early activity will center around the Korean Task
                            Force headed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>.
                            The <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> principals will be notified
                            through the procedures internal to their organizations and would await
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>’s call. In the way
                            of crisis preparation, each agency would review its procedures and the
                                <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> principals would insure that
                            the scenario elements relating to their individual agencies would be
                            adequately covered. <hi rend="italic">All</hi> agreed that the <gloss
                                target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> papers would be tightly held.</p>
                        <p>A discussion of the public information aspects ensued. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said the handling of
                            the <gloss target="#t_PIO1">PIO</gloss> releases (both timing and
                            content) would affect the options available. The draft Presidential
                            statement, for example, would set the tone of much that followed.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> cautioned that the
                            scenarios should take into consideration Presidential style. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> would probably not want
                            to make a public statement at the conclusion of an <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting, but would do so close to the
                            time of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> response. <hi
                                rend="italic">All</hi> agreed that the President is the key for both
                            decisions and timing and that it is non-productive to try to “blue
                            print” these aspects of the scenario.</p>
                        <p>At this point (5:31 P.M.) <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> was called out of the meeting. In his absence
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> asked for
                            opinions on how the problem of subsidiary decisions was handled in the
                            scenario. He called attention to the lack of mention of decisions on
                            “rules of engagement”, saying that enemy reactions would probably be
                            immediate and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces would have to be
                            prepared beforehand. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            rejoined the group (5:37 P.M.).</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said we don’t
                            really have a body of supporting decisions. Instead there are two orders
                            of decisions, the first involving such things as rules of engagement and
                                <gloss target="#t_DEFCON1">DEFCON</gloss> levels, the latter being
                            important from a political as well as military standpoint. <gloss
                                target="#t_DEFCON1">DEFCON</gloss> levels represent “signals” of
                            resolve and will be of particular significance to the Soviet Union. More
                            work is required in developing the <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0114"
                            />catalog of decisions. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            said the President should be told what decisions he has to make long
                            before the particular decision will be translated into action. The
                                <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> should recommend a schedule of
                            times when the various decisions should be put into effect. In this
                            context, the scenarios should reflect the time necessary to implement
                            each of the corollary decisions contained in the paper.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked about probable
                            losses. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_JNC1">Johnson</persName> said he
                            thought the White House had this information. Colonel <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRM1">Behr</persName> confirmed this fact. Probable
                            losses will be available to the President for each of the alternative
                            military responses.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> then brought up
                            the subject of probable enemy responses. He is generally in agreement
                            with the plausibility of those responses identified in the scenario but
                            believes the comments relating to them are somewhat superficial.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> recalled the lesson
                            of the <gloss target="#t_EC1211">EC–121</gloss> incident that was
                            foremost in his mind. The trick in a crisis is not to do a certain thing
                            but to do it in a way that prevents something worse. But you also have
                            to consider what you will do if your act fails to prevent any escalating
                            response. Would you not, for example, in the event of an attack against
                            the <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_AOB1">AOB</gloss> have to start ground forces moving
                            west? Admiral <persName corresp="#p_JNC1">Johnson</persName> replied
                            that we have to be prepared for the worst, but that certain actions
                            meant different things to different people. A general discussion of
                            possible <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and enemy responses followed
                            ending with direction to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1"
                                >Brown</persName> to take another hard look at this part of the
                            paper.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KTH1">Karamessines</persName> said that each
                            response was connected with other events. They did not occur in a
                            vacuum. For instance, while the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> may
                            move troops, contact with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            (diplomatic and by MOLINK) would signify the willingness of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to observe a “cease-fire” if the Russians
                            thought they could “deliver” the North Koreans. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed, pointing out that in
                            the Cuban crisis the public statements made by President Kennedy had a
                            direct bearing on the behavior of the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> wondered whether a
                            military action should not be done “ferociously” in order to obtain the
                            full deterrent effect. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"
                                >Johnson</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss>
                            needed to make a fundamental decision in order to provide guidance for
                            the Working Group. Do we play it cool or look fierce? <persName
                                corresp="#p_KTH1">Karamessines</persName> said there are pros and
                            cons to each approach. If we take a very determined line, the Soviets
                            will probably believe us—the Red Chinese may not. <hi rend="italic"
                                >All</hi> agreed that in the heavy response scenario an increased
                                <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss> readiness posture should be
                            called for as well as such obvious signals as moving air units westward
                            and alerting the 82nd Airborne Division for movement. <persName

                            decisions on a contingent basis—the reparable ones should be grouped
                            apart from the irreparable.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> flagged an area

                            full exchange of views Admiral <persName corresp="#p_JNC1"
                                >Johnson</persName> deferred to State on the timing, requiring only
                            that the time of notification be delayed until absolutely the last
                            minute which would still allow the diplomats time to do their job.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> took exception
                            with the Joint Staff’s optimism regarding <gloss target="#t_NK1"
                                >NK</gloss> ability to retaliate by, say, a strike against Seoul.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_JNC1">Johnson</persName> explained the
                            concept of operations at length, stressing airborne radar surveillance
                            and air defense capabilities. He agreed, however, that an air attack
                            against Seoul was possible, but it would probably be light.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the subject of diplomatic conversations, the possibility of
                            leaks, and the possibility of degrading the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> effort, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            questioned the value of getting detailed recommendations and opinions
                            from our diplomatic posts. Unless the President has personal knowledge
                            of, and confidence in, a given Ambassador he is unlikely in a crisis to
                            accept advice from anyone who is not a principal. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> agreed and directed <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> to re-work the paper to reflect
                            that judgment.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked what kind of
                            provocation was the basis for scenario being reviewed. <hi rend="italic"
                                >All</hi> agreed that only a massive <gloss target="#t_NK1"
                                >NK</gloss> attack would call for so drastic a response.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> inquired about the
                            operational aspects. Who is going to run all of this? No one
                            responded.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> turned to future
                            events. He called for re-work of the heavy response scenario in
                            accordance with the instructions of the group. This should be followed
                            by revamping the “surgical strike” scenario, bringing it to the same
                            high quality as the other paper. He asked about the status of Middle
                            East planning, asking Admiral <persName corresp="#p_JNC1"
                                >Johnson</persName> if it were not still true that the military have
                            no plans for a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> confrontation in that area. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_JNC1">Johnson</persName> said that is so, but
                            work is in progress. Lack of both bases and forces are the main
                            problems. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>
                            reported on the work being done by Rodger Davies’ Working Group. This
                            work is not up to the quality of the Korean plans, but a great deal of
                            time is being devoted to the problem because of the existing critical
                            situation in the Middle East. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> asked if a draft would be available in two
                            weeks. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said
                            yes; Admiral <persName corresp="#p_JNC1">Johnson</persName> said maybe.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then said he
                            wanted, of the possibilities which had been discussed, a scenario for
                            the Middle East which postulated the Arabs as aggressors and with Soviet
                            military involvement beyond the now-existing border lines. <hi
                                rend="italic">All</hi> agreed this was the most difficult scenario
                            and the one which should be developed as a straw-man.</p>

                            rough cut at a Middle East plan would be the agenda items. The meeting
                            adjourned at 6:36 P.M.</p>

                            its treaty obligations with the Asian countries concerned. We will honor
                            the U.S.–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Defense Treaty. What we
                            must think over is what would be the best way to keep these commitments.
                            We have relaxed our travel restrictions and purchases with regard to
                            Communist China, but we regard Communist China as an aggressive nation.
                            U.S. policy toward Communist China has not changed, and we will not
                            admit the country into the U.N. It is also necessary in this connection
                            to pay attention to the Sino-Soviet conflict. As you know, the Soviet
                            Union has not helped us in solving the issues concerning Communist
                            China, North Korea, the Vietnam War and the Middle East. It is also one
                            of the countries which provide military aid to North Korea.</p>
                        <p>We cannot cooperate with the Soviet Union without the latter’s reciprocal
                            acts. Under these circumstances, a collective security with the Soviets
                            against Communist China is meaningless. It is first necessary for the
                            Soviets to act with sincerity.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the non-Communist countries located on the periphery of
                            Communist China must be strengthened since they are threatened by
                            Communist China, North Korea and North Vietnam. The Soviet Union will
                            also become a greater threat than now if it is left alone.</p>
                        <p>Now with regard to Vietnam, we are aware of various efforts made by the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> in South Vietnam. We are
                            withdrawing our troops from <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> when we
                            think that the South Vietnamese have built the ability to replace them.
                            As we informed you in advance, I agreed with President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NVT1">Thieu</persName> at Midway to withdraw 25,000
                            troops. During my recent talks with him, we decided to replace more
                            troops in August, but we have been withholding taking the measure due to
                            the enemy offensive of 2 weeks ago. Probably within about 10 days,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NVT1">Thieu</persName>, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_ACW1">Abrams</persName> and other leaders
                            concerned will talk over the subject again. We will inform you in
                            advance the number and time of these troop withdrawals, which will be
                            carried out as long as they do not affect our combat capabilities.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the Paris talks, I just had a talk with Ambassador Lodge
                            today, who informed me that there has been no progress. As you know,
                            November 1 is the first anniversary of our bombing halt. If I had been
                            the President last November, I would not have halted the bombing. This
                            is just between us; if there is no further progress in the Paris talks,
                            we will re-evaluate the situation about October 15.</p>

                        <p>I believe that your government’s efforts toward military and economic
                            self-reliance are the correct road to take. I hope that other countries
                            in Asia will follow suit. It is necessary for the U.S. to continue to
                            play a great role in Asia. I think that economic and military aid to
                            those countries like the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> which make
                            self-reliance efforts should be continued. The self-reliance remarks you
                            made this morning (at the Presidio of San Francisco), I think, were good
                            ones for American public opinion to consume. As a private citizen and
                            government official, I travelled a great deal in the Pacific region. I
                            can assure you that we will not retreat from the Pacific area and we
                            will not reduce our commitments, but I think we need intelligent policy,
                            by giving aid to the countries who attempt to help themselves. I have
                            just made a general statement. Do you have any questions on such
                            subjects as military equipment and economic development?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Pak</persName>: I appreciate
                            hearing your firm policy toward the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>,
                            Asia in general and the Communist Bloc. I would like to make my views
                            clear on these subjects. As you know, <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim
                                Il-Song</persName> during the past 10 years or so has almost
                            completed war preparations to unify the country by force. He is looking
                            for an opportunity to invade the South. He has not done so because of
                            the U.S. commitments to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and the
                            presence of American troops in our country. <persName>Kim</persName>
                            will provoke a war if he believes that this American policy toward the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is going to change or has
                            changed. <persName>Kim</persName>’s objective in making various
                            provocations is to have American troops stationed in the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> withdraw as they have done in South
                            Vietnam, alienate the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> from the U.S.
                            and have the U.S. not intervene when anything happens in Korea. The
                            strengthening of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> defense would check
                            these provocations of <persName>Kim</persName> and have him give up the
                            idea of invading the South by force. A way to achieve this objective is
                            to strengthen the equipment and combat capability of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces rather than to strengthen U.S.
                            forces in South Korea, to the extent that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> can singlehandedly resist North Korean invasion, since
                            the U.S. has various commitments all over the world.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: If the Soviets or
                            the Chinese invade the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, it will be a
                            different ball game. Since you were in the military, I would like to
                            elaborate a little on my decision on the establishment of the ABM
                                network.<note n="4" xml:id="d35fn4">On March 14, the President
                                announced his decision for an ABM program that included a Safeguard
                                system, which was a modified version of <persName corresp="#p_JLB1"
                                    >Lyndon Johnson</persName>’s Sentinel system. Safeguard called
                                for 12 separate sites for area missile defense, 19 radars, and

                            non-nuclear countries in Asia and pose a danger to the U.S. That is why
                            this subject is so important for the defense and security of the Free

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Pak</persName>: To continue my
                            views, the Korean War, anti-guerrilla operations (in the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>) and Vietnamese War have been carried
                            well with U.S. aid. Concerning Korea, I do not think you have to worry
                            about the Korean problem if our equipment is further strengthened. I
                            believe that we can meet North Korean threats without increasing the
                            present level of U.S. force in South Korea if (military) equipment is
                            strengthened.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: In this
                            connection, we are now studying sympathetically the <gloss

                            visit to your country. I am aware of the fact that some of the <gloss

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Pak</persName>: I appreciate your

                                >Nixon</persName> doctrine on Asia.<note n="5" xml:id="d35fn5">See
                                    <ref target="#d35fn3">footnote 3</ref> above.</note> I agree in
                            principle with your new policy, especially on the aspect of having those
                            countries which have relied on the U.S. since the end of World War II
                            try to help themselves. Some Asians, however, are apprehensive because
                            of their misconception and misunderstanding of your policy, believing
                            that the U.S. intends to wash its hands of Asia, leaving Asian problems
                            to the Asians themselves. They will naturally dispel this apprehension
                            when they fully understand your new policy. It will be necessary for us
                            to give guidelines and study methods of gradually decreasing the U.S.
                            burdens so as to have these Asian countries able to defend themselves.
                            In this connection, I would like to have the U.S. guide various
                            countries of Asia so they can share the responsibility and burdens in
                            accordance with their respective ability. At present, some countries are
                            sharing excessive burdens beyond their ability and vice versa. The
                            Republic of Korea and Japan are good examples. Korea is not only divided
                            but also is a developing country. Japan, despite its strong economy, is
                            hardly carrying its share of the burdens in Asia. The Japanese are even
                            trying to refuse to provide military bases to Okinawa when it is
                            returned to Japan, thus hindering the unity of Asia. Several Asian
                            countries as well as the people of South Korea are dissatisfied with
                            such a Japanese posture. I do not have the details on the bilateral
                            negotiations for the return of Okinawa to Japan, but I believe that if
                            the island is to be reverted to Japan, <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100"
                                facs="0127"/>the Japanese share of the burdens in Asia must be
                            increased first, before Okinawa is actually returned.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: This is a
                            delicate issue because of the constitution of Japan which we helped
                            draft. For a long time I have thought that Japan should play a much more
                            significant role than the present in its defense and collective economic
                            activity. Some progress has been made in the economic aspect. As you are
                            aware, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName> is
                            coming here in November, and we should make every effort to have him
                            survive politically. Free Korea is very important to Free Japan. Japan
                            spends only about one percent of its <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>
                            in its defense, which I believe is too small.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Pak</persName>: The Japanese say
                            that the defense and security of South Korea and Japan are interrelated,
                            but in practice they haven’t done anything.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: That is true.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Pak</persName>: They think that
                            they do not have to do anything since they have South Korea in front of
                            them and the U.S. in back of them. They need U.S. advice in this regard.
                            For example, most of the “equipment” carried by North Korean guerrillas
                            who have infiltrated into South Korea such as their radios and shoes are
                            made in Japan. Although we made a protest against this, they continue to
                            sell these items to make a profit. Thus the people of South Korea have
                            no good feelings toward the Japanese. Incidentally, there have been
                            reports to the effect that since American troops have been withdrawing,
                            other allied troops might follow suit. It is my thinking that unless we
                            are requested by South Vietnam or the U.S., we will continue to station
                            our troops in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: There has been no
                            progress in the Paris talks, and November 1 is the first anniversary of
                            our bombing halt. What do you think our tactics should be? Do you think
                            we should reopen the bombings?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Pak</persName>: It is up to your
                            decision, but I think it is difficult (to reopen the bombings) because
                            of your domestic public opinion. When I was informed by Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> regarding the bombing
                            halt, last November, I told him how we would be taking this action
                            without reciprocal action or commitment on the part of North
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: In the event that
                            we resume our bombings, what do you think the reactions of Asia would
                            be?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Pak</persName>: Free countries in
                            Asia would welcome it. But it is up to your decision.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: What is your view
                            on the Sino-Soviet conflict? How deep do you think it is and how long do
                            you believe it might last?</p>
                        <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0128"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Pak</persName>: We have analyzed
                            the situation a great deal. There is a 50–50 chance a war might break
                            out between the two countries. Some believe that a war will not be
                            staged since both of them know they both would suffer a great deal of
                            damage and a war might be a prolonged one. On the other hand, some
                            interpret that the longer the present conflict continues, the harder for
                            the Soviets to deal with Communist China. We also have information that
                            the Soviet military takes a hawkish attitude. One thing is certain,
                            though—the present conflict will not be solved in the near future.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: I oppose the view
                            that the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. should cooperate to restrain Communist
                            China. Both the Soviet Union and China are our potential enemy, and this
                            view does not make sense. If the Soviet Union sweeps over China, the
                            former will get stronger, posing a greater threat to Asia.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Pak</persName>: I agree with
                            you.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: This explains the
                            reasons why we have eased the travel restrictions and purchases. We are
                            trying to dispel the Soviet idea of opposing China by cooperating with
                            the U.S. But we will continue to support Free China, and our policy
                            toward Communist China remains the same as before.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Pak</persName>: It would be better
                            for us to remove both powers than have one of the powers get stronger
                            than the other.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: The economic
                            growth rate in such countries as South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Free
                            China and Thailand has grown higher than other countries of the world,
                            whereas the economic level of China and North Korea has been lowered.
                            Now the danger is in the area of subversion. This is acute in the <gloss

                            beyond the Parallel. Although, as you know, public opinion here demands
                            reduction of troops we have all over the world, I rejected the idea of
                            decreasing the number of our men staying in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"

                            progressed at a fast tempo. Although our defense budget this year is
                            tight, I think we will be able to meet some of the requests the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has made. I do not want to give a wrong
                            notion to <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-Song</persName> that the
                            U.S. is lessening its responsibility for the defense of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. Now, I know you have various economic
                            programs under way. This will be known in two to three weeks, but I
                            would like to inform you that today the Export-Import Bank has decided
                            to give <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0129"/>$73 million to the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> for the construction of one
                            power plant and an atomic power plant. Since I heard that your country
                            wants more private investment unlike some of the Asian countries, I plan
                            to encourage this aspect.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Pak</persName>: As I told you in
                            the car (while proceeding to the St. Francis Hotel from the Presidio of
                            San Francisco), the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is indebted to
                            the U.S. for its economic growth. Our “financial independence rate”
                            until a few years ago was about 50 percent. It will be 94.8 percent in
                            the next fiscal year and almost 100 percent in the year after next. We
                            will, however, need surplus agricultural products for the time being. We
                            have encouraged exports to obtain more foreign currency and private
                            investment. The South Korean people have been making efforts to achieve
                            a self-independent economy, and I hope you would consider giving us
                            assistance to achieve this target during the next several years.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: I have held the
                            same view since my first visit to your country in 1953. It is difficult
                            with this year’s budget, but the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is
                            an exception.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Pak</persName>: The U.S. has been
                            imposing a restriction on its import of textiles, but I hope that you
                            make the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> an exception in the measure
                            so as to help the country achieve its economic independence.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: The matter on the
                            textiles mainly concerns Japan. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            has entered the textile market only during the recent years. I hope that
                            a reasonable solution can be found to satisfy both the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and Japan. We can discuss the matter in
                            detail tomorrow, but this is not an easy problem to solve. I will try to
                            deal with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> problem
                            discreetly.</p>

                                could not presently be resolved but would be a question later was
                                the degree to which the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mantle
                                should be wrapped around our actions as opposed to the degree to
                                which we would rely on the Mutual Defense Treaty. The <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mantle would be an advantage but
                                there are those in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> who would
                                try to tear it off. In these drafts for the President, the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> toga was not wrapped around much, but
                                we might wish to do so later depending on the circumstances.</item>

                            <item>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted that
                                the drafts had been seen by both the President and the Attorney
                                General, and the President had asked him to tell the group of his
                                intense interest in them. The President had also asked that the
                                Attorney General sit in on the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss>
                                and be kept informed on crisis situations. The other members
                                welcomed the addition of the Attorney General.</item>

                                House. He stated that there would be no minute-by-minute watch in
                                the White House, but there would be a small policy group there,
                                including the Attorney General, which would be superimposed. For the
                                rest, flexibility had to be maintained, and he envisaged different
                                groups spending varying amounts of time, with only the Task Force
                                maintaining a 24-hour watch.</item>

                            <item>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> offered a
                                comment based on the sense of the President’s thinking: The
                                President would be unlikely short of a full-scale North Korean
                                attack to order major military countermeasures. He also would be
                                unlikely [<hi rend="italic">7 lines not declassified</hi>] and a
                                list of all that needs to be done politically. The <gloss
                                    target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> would have the responsibility for
                                keeping these plans under constant review, taking into consideration
                                such elements as <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> force reductions
                                in Korea and elsewhere.</item>

                            <item>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> raised the
                                question of at what point the Mutual Defense Treaty would be
                                invoked. Ambassador <persName>Johnson</persName> replied to the
                                effect that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces on the line
                                would be involved from the beginning, and that the constitutional
                                question would exist only in the United States. This issue also
                                related to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, e.g. on the merits
                                of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution versus reliance on
                                the Mutual Defense Treaty to cloak our actions.</item>

                            <item>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> declared that
                                we had learned from the <gloss target="#t_EC1211">EC–121</gloss>
                                incident that however difficult it might be now to estimate what
                                might happen in a crisis situation, it would not be easier under the
                                pressure of events to deal with such questions as the pros and cons
                                of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> approach versus the
                                bilateral. He asked if matters of this nature could not be put into
                                the annex to give some hint as to what would best serve <gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interests at the time. Other
                                questions should also be put in for the President, such as the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> veto, the make up of the
                                Security Council, etc. It would be helpful to say that if the
                                President accepts the plans, these are the decisions he will have to
                                make, and list the criteria; we would also wish to similarly list
                                decisions which would be deferred. Amplification of the annex then
                                would be called for.</item>

                                incident, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                                wondered whether on alerts it would not be possible to be more
                                specific, i.e., if we were to go after the North Korean air order of
                                battle, we would certainly then want to go on <gloss
                                    target="#t_DEFCON1">DEFCON</gloss>. We should recommend what
                                state of alert should be adopted. The President would want guidance
                                which would help him. This could always be modified. Could we not
                                say now that an increase in <gloss target="#t_SAC1">SAC</gloss>
                                readiness would be required? It was agreed that such guidance should
                                be included.</item>

                                    <persName>Johnson</persName> recommending two hours from the

                                agreeing that from the security standpoint, thirty minutes would be
                                more satisfactory. It was left that the decision would be made on

                            <item>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> raised the
                                problem of calling for a North Korean ceasefire. This appeared to
                                him to be acceptable if the North Koreans were to undo what they had
                                done. However, we wanted to avoid a situation where we might trade a
                                territorial fait accompli for a single <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                    >US</gloss> air strike, with further action precluded by a
                                ceasefire. He recommended that an asterisk be added (page 16) to the
                                effect that we would not stop our activities or call for a ceasefire
                                until the North Koreans undid what they had done. It was generally
                                agreed that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council
                                should be called in the event of a North Korean attack.</item>

                            <item>To finish up the comments on Korea, it was agreed that the

                            should be an early determination of satellite surveillance requirements

                        <p>The meeting began at 4:45 P.M. with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"
                                >Johnson</persName> in the chair in the absence of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> who was detained in the
                            President’s office. The acting chairman suggested that the agenda be
                            limited to a wrap-up of the Korean papers and a discussion of the
                            Sino-Soviet paper. The Middle East papers are not yet, he stated, in a
                            form to be addressed by the principals. He called upon <persName
                                corresp="#p_CWI1">Cargo</persName> to set the stage for discussions
                            of the Sino-Soviet paper.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is discussion unrelated to Korea.]</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then turned to the
                            Korea papers, asking if they were ready for <gloss target="#t_WSAG1"
                                >WSAG</gloss> approval. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"
                                >Johnson</persName> replied affirmatively, but subject to the
                            addition of the text, and short discussion, of the Soviet-North Korean
                            Mutual Defense Treaty. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            said he had only one reservation about the Korea scenario, and that had
                            to do with the effectiveness of alerting procedures and <gloss
                                target="#t_DEFCON1">DEFCON</gloss> level as signal of U.S. resolve.
                            He noted two things to be avoided in handling a crisis situation—on the
                            one hand timidity, and on the other hand, those actions signalling
                            prelude to major war. Would not a quick and ferocious response that
                            would clearly be a “one shot” operation be a more suitable course in
                            order to discourage North Korea from further response? He will write up
                            this alternative, giving the President the benefit of both views. After
                            this addition, the Korean scenarios will be considered finished, with
                            the understanding that they will be up-dated as required when military
                            dispositions change. Additionally, they will be reviewed every three
                            months.</p>
                        <p>No definite date was set for the next <gloss target="#t_WSAG1"
                                >WSAG</gloss> meeting other than that one would be required before

                                    reactions are of interest: He wanted the study couched in
                                    concrete five-year planning terms. He ruled out the “top option”
                                    of increased <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> preparedness
                                    plus a major <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> presence, but at
                                    the same time he appeared to accept the possibility that a

                                    to integrate them with the thinking that comes out of <gloss
                                        target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 27. In specific terms, we
                                    found a strange sense of unreality and a lack of focus. It was
                                    unclear whether the supplemental was intended to meet the North
                                    Korean air threat or its infiltration capabilities. Moreover, in
                                    the Korean <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0137"/>context, we
                                    are suspicious of a counter infiltration program which seems to
                                    rely on a sophisticated, integrated radar network, and which
                                    made no provision at all for high speed patrol craft, which
                                    seemed to be the prime necessity. What does Ambassador <persName

                                        <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s undertake a more active
                                    campaign to seize the propaganda initiative from North Korea?
                                    The Communists propose postal exchanges and family reunions.
                                    Given the relative economic and political conditions of the two
                                    countries, one would think that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"

                            third team. He indicates, correctly, that I have not concurred in this
                            course.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Marshall</persName>’s rationale is that (a)
                            the Japanese have been stirred up by a press conference recently given
                            by Secretary of Commerce <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> in
                            which <persName corresp="#p_SMH1">Stans</persName> took a very hard line
                            on restricting Japanese textile imports, and (b) the Japanese therefore
                            will want to know from <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Trezise</persName>
                            (who is going to Japan to negotiate liberalization of Japanese imports
                            from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and not to talk about
                            textiles) whether others are also facing <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> import restrictions on textiles. The point is put
                            forward that <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Trezise</persName>’s whole
                            mission may be prejudiced if he cannot tell senior Japanese that the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, Hong Kong, and the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> are also involved. I presume that the
                            assumption, although not stated, is that misery loves company and that
                            the Japanese will feel all right about the restrictions on them if they
                            are aware that others are also subject to restrictions.</p>
                        <p>My problem concerns the President’s decision not to bring up the textile
                            question with the Koreans until after the Referendum, and his assurance
                            to <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> in San Francisco<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d40fn3">See <ref target="#d35">Document
                                35</ref>.</note> that the textile question would be handled
                            “discreetly.” In my judgment, we can have no assurance that the Japanese
                            who would learn about Korean involvement would not leak; on the
                            contrary, I believe that they would have every incentive to leak. They
                            would not be addressing <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Trezise</persName>
                            as individuals but as representatives of an entire industry that is
                            bothered by restrictions, and would certainly wish to pass on whatever
                                <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Trezise</persName> tells them to the
                            manufacturers they represent—who in turn would probably make the
                            information public, even if the people at the top did not. The result
                            would be that <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> and the
                            Koreans would learn about the boom being lowered on them before the
                            Referendum, which is precisely what we are trying to avoid. Worse, the
                            Koreans would learn about the matter from the Japanese press, which
                            hardly could be considered discreet handling. We would be likely to end
                            up with two angry Presidents on our hands. I have told all this to
                                <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Marshall Green</persName>, who, as you
                            may recall, was the very one who wanted to delay informing the Koreans
                            until after the Referendum. All this can be avoided if we simply do what

                                >Trezise</persName>’s whole purpose will be compromised if he cannot
                            discuss textile restrictions. The Japanese are thoroughly aware of the
                            growing resentment in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> of the fact
                            that the Japanese howl about our restrictions and yet are extremely
                            rigid in excluding <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-manufactured goods
                            from Japan. They must know that they are going to have to make
                            concessions on their part if they wish to avoid <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> import quotas being imposed on them. This is the
                            argument which will count, not the knowledge that there are others who
                            will share their bed of pain on textiles.</p>

                        <p>I doubt that the North Koreans will yield on their demand for an apology
                            on their terms, and may even balk at State’s reformulation. If we want
                            the men back, we will sooner or later have to go through this drill. I
                            am assured by State that the language as proposed will not cause us any
                            particular problem in the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> debates,

                        <p>At the 303 Committee meeting on June 17, 1969, consideration was given to
                            a <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> proposal to fly four to six SR–71
                            overflights of North Korea monthly subject to 303 Committee approval
                            each month. On June 20th you specifically approved two initial SR–71
                            overflights of North Korea.</p>
                        <p>The two initial flights and a third authorized by the 303 Committee in
                            early August produced considerable significant intelligence not before
                            available. There was no known North Korean reaction to these
                            overflights. Approval for additional SR–71 overflights has been withheld
                            by the Committee during the current negotiations with the North Koreans
                            for release of the captured U.S. three-man helicopter crew.</p>
                        <p>The helicopter crew have now been in North Korean hands for approximately
                            six weeks, and negotiations for their release still seem to be making no
                            progress.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> would
                            like to resume SR–71 overflights of North Korea on an approximately once
                            a month basis subject to review of intelligence requirements and mission
                            by mission approval of the 303 Committee.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State believes resumption of these missions may
                            jeopardize negotiations for the release of the three prisoners and
                            recommends a continued indefinite SR–71 stand-down pending their
                            outcome.</p>

                        <p>I think the time has come to reduce our Korean presence. We could not do

                            have planned. On the other hand, I think it is time to cut the number of
                            Americans there in half and I want to see a plan which will implement
                            this laid before me before the end of the year. It, of course, should be

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> made the following

                                <item>—he wants to build up the Home Reserve Forces to help
                                    forestall North Korean hit-and-run raids along the
                                    coasts.</item>
                                <item>—he wants to avoid extreme actions and does not intend to
                                    “march north.”</item>
                                <item>—the North Koreans will not attempt all-out war if the South
                                    Korean economy prospers and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                                    forces remain, but war is “inevitable” if <gloss target="#t_US1"

                                <item>—therefore, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> needs to
                                    match North Korean armed forces to deter or defeat aggression,

                        </p>
                        <p>I think that this report will provide an excellent framework for you to
                            use in making known your decision on your policy toward Korea and the
                            U.S. presence there for the next five years. It will lay out the
                            principal policy and program alternatives toward Korea in the following
                            areas: <list>
                                <item>—U.S. force and presence levels in Korea,</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>The scope and thoroughness of this report should enable you to formulate
                            an overall policy toward Korea and to adjust the U.S. programs in Korea
                            accordingly.</p>
                        <p>This Korea plan is now being revised on the basis of agency comments. It
                            will be ready for your consideration by late December. I have scheduled
                            an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting on Korea for January
                            21.</p>
                        <p>The implementation of your decision to reduce the U.S. presence in Korea
                            will require a sound approach to consultations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> so that we can minimize the likelihood
                            of a confrontation with President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> or a pullout of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            troops from Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Fortunately, State and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> have already
                            started to work out approaches to these problems without any knowledge
                            of your decision. As a result, the implementation of U.S. presence
                            reduction following the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting on
                            Korea can probably be carried out smoothly and rapidly.</p>
                        <p>If you approve, I will proceed with preparation of a Korea plan for an
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting on January 21 and ensure
                            that work on the implementation of your decision is completed shortly

                                    (item 6 of report).</item>

                        <p>Personnel error is, of course, always possible. But as a minimum, all
                            personnel operating in the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> should be
                            frequently reminded of the importance of following instructions to the
                            letter and indoctrination qualifications of helicopter pilots must not
                            become perfunctory. I believe that the incidents themselves will tend to
                            ensure stringent adherence to existing procedures in the near future.
                            However, an informal check should be made about six months from now that
                            personnel near the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> have not become

                                assistance program for Korea. <persName corresp="#p_REL1"
                                    >Richardson</persName> noted that the Departments of Treasury
                                and Agriculture concurred.</note> It is designed to support Korea’s
                            large defense effort and economic development program. The amounts have
                            now all been appropriated by Congress. All agencies concur.</p>

                        <p>The Korean <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> has risen at a spectacular
                            rate of 11 percent per annum since 1964. However, growth has been
                            accompanied by rising inflationary pressures, balance of payments
                            problems, and a rapid increase in external debt. The proposed program
                            will be accompanied by self-help conditions, supporting economic
                            stabilization and debt control measures recommended by the World Bank
                            and IMF. It maintains the declining trend in our economic assistance to
                            Korea, as the country moves toward a self-sustaining economic
                            position.</p>
                        <p>A $39 million credit for Korean purchases of U.S. rice, which (270,000
                            tons) is part of the proposed <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480
                            package, involves a proposed waiver of Korea’s local currency
                            downpayment. Section 103 of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480
                            permits such a waiver where you determine that a downpayment would be
                            inconsistent with the Act, and it was done on a similar deal in
                            1969.</p>
                        <p>Agriculture, responding to pressures from California rice growers anxious
                            to dispose of a large surplus, recommends that you authorize the waiver
                            to reduce our terms below those of the Japanese and thus to assure our
                            rice a portion of the Korean market. The remaining portion (230,000
                            tons) of Korea’s estimated 500,000 ton import requirement will probably
                            be supplied by the Japanese on concessional terms.</p>
                        <p>Next month the National Security Council is scheduled to consider U.S.
                            long-range posture with respect to Korea, including our level of
                            military presence, military and economic assistance programs, and trade
                            policies. The present proposal pertains only to the rest of <gloss

                            decisions, e.g. an increase in economic assistance as a quid pro quo for
                            possible decreases in U.S. military force levels. Such assistance would

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked <gloss

                                >Brown</persName> why they had wished to advance consideration of

                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_Amb1">Amb</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_BWG1"
                                >Brown</persName> replied there were two reasons: (1) State’s desire
                            to allow maximum time between any decisions which may be made about
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> force posture in Korea and the
                            Korean elections in 1971, so as to give <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> maximum freedom of maneuver; and (2) to ensure that
                            any decisions on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces in Korea
                            receive thorough consideration and are not taken hastily in view of the
                            severe budgetary pressures on the Defense Department.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if all agreed
                            with the statement of the issues, including the comments circulated by
                            State at the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWI1">Cargo</persName> referred to State
                            comment No. 3 and recommended that Postures 4 and 5 be eliminated from
                            discussion in order to simplify the paper.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked how these
                            postures came to be included and if anyone was opposed to their
                            elimination.</p>
                        <p>General Unger noted that the postures were stated in terms of what would
                            be required to resist a North Korean attack or a combined North
                            Korean/Chinese Communist attack, with current equipment or with
                            modernized equipment. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> took the
                            position that, assuming continued presence of two <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> divisions, 19 <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            divisions would be required to resist a combined attack. He agreed that
                            future developments, including increased <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss>, could permit a reduction of these figures, but thought
                            that at the present time any reduction below the 19 division <pb n="126"
                                xml:id="pg_126" facs="0153"/>level would risk defeat. Therefore, the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> reserved its position on the
                            last paragraph of page 2 of the Issues Paper and suggested a restatement
                            of page 3, paragraph 3, along the lines of the amendment distributed at
                            the table. He expressed grave concern at the sources of the figures used
                            in the paper and said he had asked the Chiefs to readdress the question
                            of the number of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions that
                            would be required, taking into account possible increased <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> or increased modernization.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Court pointed out that the Defense Department had cleared the
                            statements in the Issues Paper.</p>
                        <p>General Unger agreed that there had been a great deal of work on these
                            issues but said the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> had not really
                            analyzed the meaning and the effect of “modernized” equipment versus
                            present equipment. He cited the statement that 16 to 18 divisions with
                            modernized equipment would equal 23 divisions with current equipment. He
                            cited the statement that during the Korean War 17 <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions had
                            defeated one million North Korean/Communist Chinese, but pointed out
                            that half of these 17 were <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> divisions,
                            and that we had complete air supremacy. He said the whole situation was
                            being readdressed by the Chiefs, noting, for example, that the cost
                            figures on the list of equipment needed for modernization for 18
                            divisions totalled $800 million.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said the President
                            hates to be hit cold on issues of this kind and he would be reluctant to
                            go into an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting at which General
                                <persName corresp="#p_WEG1">Wheeler</persName> would raise these
                            issues before the President for the first time. He asked Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> if he would object if
                            the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting were postponed to
                            February 25.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> agreed, but
                            pointed out that he had asked these questions concerning force
                            structures a year ago and thought he had the answers.</p>
                        <p>General Unger agreed that there had been military participation
                            throughout the drafting of the study, but he had found that many of the
                            statements in the paper were based on figures the source of which he had
                            been unable to determine.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> agreed it was
                            more important to discuss the issue thoroughly even if it meant a slight
                            delay.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said we should look
                            at the military assumptions again.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWI1">Cargo</persName> agreed that this was
                            essential, saying he had assumed that we had Defense agreement on these
                            assumptions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said he was
                            surprised at the statement that 21 <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            divisions could defend against a North Korean attack and 23 <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions could defend against a
                            combined North Korean/Communist Chinese attack.</p>
                        <p>He thought it was necessary to get these various assumptions straightened
                            out.</p>
                        <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0154"/>
                        <p>General Unger asked if it had been agreed to drop Postures 4 and 5.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if there were
                            a consensus on considering the first three postures.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ware suggested that the issue be considered in terms of what would be
                            the minimum <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> force required combined
                            with an effective <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force.</p>
                        <p>General Unger added that the political effect of the various postures
                            should also be considered.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWI1">Cargo</persName> thought that Postures 1,
                            2 and 3 embraced the political/military realm.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if the Koreans
                            would be willing to go down to 14 divisions. It was agreed that they
                            would not.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed with Mr.
                            Ware’s suggestion that the issue should be considered in terms of what
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> needed to enable us to get by
                            with a minimum <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> force there. He thought
                            it should also take into account the corollary <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss> programs.</p>
                        <p>General Unger pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            was based on 1968 figures.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked that these
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> figures be reviewed. He asked if
                            there was possibly another option: minimum <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> forces plus adequate <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            force.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJR1">Schlesinger</persName> asked if the
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> figures included the possibility
                            of drawing on excess stocks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ware said this was very difficult to do because they do not know more
                            than one quarter ahead what the services will release as excess.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJR1">Schlesinger</persName> noted that
                            Congress has authorized only $350 million for <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss> next year. He thought going back to Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName>’s Committee for supplemental
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funds would be extremely tough
                            since the feeling on military assistance is running very high.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ware commented that this was a basic issue—the relationship of <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> to troop withdrawals and defense
                            expenditures. He thought these must be discussed in relation to the
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971 supplemental request.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted that, at the
                            time of the question of the jet aircraft for Nationalist China, the
                            President had indicated he was more interested in the Korean
                            supplemental than in the jets. He thought Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> might be more amenable to
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> if it were related to a reduced
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military presence abroad.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWI1">Cargo</persName> thought that in the
                            costing out of the various postures we would need to relate the <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> figures and the <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss> figures.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> commented that he
                            thought the study was a very good one but that we must get agreement on
                            the figures.</p>
                        <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0155"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWI1">Cargo</persName> thought that in
                            considering the minimum <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> force that
                            would be required we must be careful of the political aspect. He thought
                            reduction of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> presence below one
                            division would create political problems we could not support.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ware thought these should be considered in relationship to the
                            political/fiscal problems at home, noting that supporting a division
                            overseas was “expensive as hell.”</p>
                        <p>General Unger asked again which postures were being eliminated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said Posture 4 can
                            go since it calls for the withdrawal of both <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> divisions.</p>
                        <p>General Unger commented that Posture 2 also calls for the withdrawal of
                            both <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> divisions but includes more
                            modernized <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SF1">Shakespeare</persName> thought both 2 and
                            4 should be eliminated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if it were
                            true that a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force of 12 to 14
                            divisions could repel 25 North Korean divisions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Court replied that this was based on total manpower involved since
                            the divisions were not organized in the same manner.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said he had nothing
                            against Posture 5 if it should be found that 14 <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> divisions plus one <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            division is the right combination in the view of the <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. He thought Posture 4, which pulls out
                            both <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> divisions, would present us with
                            enormous political problems.</p>
                        <p>General Unger replied that Posture 2 also pulls out both divisions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if we should
                            then eliminate both 2 and 4 and reserve a position on 5 depending on the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> judgment as to what <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces would be required with minimum
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces. Or should we eliminate 4
                            and redefine 2 in terms of minimum <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            force required.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWI1">Cargo</persName> suggested that we leave
                            1, 3 and 5 as they are; that we drop 4; and that we add to 2 the concept
                            of minimum <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> force.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed we should
                            drop 4.</p>
                        <p>General Unger noted that Posture 2 equals 18 <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> divisions and no <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            divisions. He thought that if these 18 divisions were brought up to
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> standards through modernization,
                            it might be reasonable to leave in Posture 2.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SF1">Shakespeare</persName> asked if the
                            President would seriously consider pulling out all <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> divisions from Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied that the
                            President would seriously consider Posture 2 if it should be concluded
                            that this represented the proper mix of <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces,
                            along the lines of Mr. Ware’s formulation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SF1">Shakespeare</persName> noted the symbolism
                            of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military presence in Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed that it was
                            inconceivable that the President would decide to withdraw all <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces from Korea. He noted that under
                                <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0156"/>Option 2 a 15,000-man
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> force would remain which could
                            include a brigade.</p>
                        <p>General Unger agreed there would be a residual force.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> suggested that we
                            look at 2 from Mr. Ware’s point of view. Could this residual <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> force equate to the minimum <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> force required? Are 18 <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions the right number of
                            divisions?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Proctor referred to the “substantial safety factor” (page 4, Issues
                            Paper) and asked what was considered a substantial safety factor.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJR1">Schlesinger</persName> noted that Table 1
                            had been figured on five-year totals for 1970–74. If we shifted these to
                            1971–75 we would get different cost impacts. The cost would also be
                            different if it were based on withdrawal by June 1971 rather than
                            withdrawal by June 1972. He thought the costing did not reflect the full
                            flexibility available to us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed that this was
                            a good point.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ware noted that Defense was already on the ‘72 budget cycle.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJR1">Schlesinger</persName> answered that they
                            would not have to change their ‘71 budget in order to withdraw troops
                            from Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SF1">Shakespeare</persName> noted, with regard
                            to [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>]. He asked if there
                            was a reasonable order of probability that this would happen.</p>
                        <p>General Unger replied that this was covered in the basic study. He said
                            there [<hi rend="italic">3½ lines not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if it were not
                            easier [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>General Unger agreed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWI1">Cargo</persName> thought this related
                            also to the question of troop deployment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SF1">Shakespeare</persName> asked if we could
                            then say there was [<hi rend="italic">1 line not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>General Unger thought we could.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> commented that in
                            Europe he thought [<hi rend="italic">3 lines not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SF1">Shakespeare</persName> commented he did
                            not think this would be true in Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> thought <persName
                                corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-Sung</persName> alternated between
                            intransigence and restraint and that he had been more restrained since
                            the <gloss target="#t_EC1211">EC–121</gloss> incident. He considered him
                            tough but not insane.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> agreed that
                                <persName>Kim</persName> was practical and tough but he also thought
                            he was insulated from reality.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if we could
                            run down the list of issues to see if they were fairly stated.</p>
                        <p>He asked if all were satisfied with the discussion of our purpose: do we
                            try to contain a North Korean attack only or a joint Chinese-North <pb
                                n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0157"/>Korean attack? He asked if the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> would analyze the force levels
                            in terms of both possibilities.</p>
                        <p>General Unger said they would do so, but because of the element of risk
                            in preparing to defend against a North Korean attack only, the <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> thought we should plan force levels to
                            resist a combined attack. He thought it a more realistic approach,
                            noting that they could plan forces which would hold back a combined
                            attack long enough to bring in reinforcements.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> identified the next
                            issue as the need for a modernization program and for what purpose. The
                            third issue, the timing of withdrawal, to be based in part on budgetary
                            and in part on political considerations. He asked Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> if we could assume that we would
                            either want this withdrawal as early as possible or would want to wait
                            until after the ‘71 Korean elections.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> thought we should
                            make no assumptions on timing until we had consulted with <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> and had his reaction.</p>
                        <p>General Unger thought in the matter of timing we should also consider
                            when the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces would be returning
                            from Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> reiterated that
                            we should take no final decision until we hear from <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed, but thought
                            we needed a statement of all the considerations bearing on the time of
                            the withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWI1">Cargo</persName> noted page 11 of the
                            Issues Paper contained some of these considerations as well as some
                            alternatives. Paragraph 8 of the State Department memorandum circulated
                            at the table was an effort to put these considerations in a broader
                            context.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> thought we would
                            be able to make a better judgment of timing when we had the information
                            from the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> on the force figures.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SF1">Shakespeare</persName> asked how important
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions in Vietnam
                            are—military or psychologically.</p>
                        <p>General Unger replied it was important to keep these forces in Vietnam.
                            The timing of their removal was of course related to Vietnamization.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SF1">Shakespeare</persName> asked about their
                            usefulness in Vietnam as opposed to the usefulness of their return to
                            Korea.</p>
                        <p>General Unger replied that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces
                            would be needed in Vietnam as long as we needed combat forces there.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> thought it was not
                            entirely up to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> as to when the
                            Korean forces were brought back from Vietnam. It would be very difficult
                            if we should press the Koreans to bring their forces back from Vietnam,
                            then we should pull our forces out of Korea. He thought the possibility
                            of trading their divisions in Vietnam for our forces in Korea <pb
                                n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0158"/>was the least possible
                            incentive for Korea to leave Vietnam. He also thought this might give an
                            unfortunate impression of general Asian disengagement. He suggested that
                            we look at the negotiating scenario again with this in mind. He asked if
                            the issues on the placement of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces
                            were fairly stated.</p>
                        <p>All agreed they were.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ware noted that State, in its memorandum of amendment, proposed
                            eliminating all alternatives but No. 3 [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                line not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWI1">Cargo</persName> explained that they did
                            not wish to see the alternatives eliminated but were talking only about
                            the system of numbering the alternatives in the Issues Paper compared
                            with that used in the basic study memo which might be confusing.</p>
                        <p>General Unger thought in order to give a better balance, we might insert
                            in the penultimate paragraph on page 14 of the Issues Paper the thought
                            that we might want to have [<hi rend="italic">1½ lines not
                                declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJR1">Schlesinger</persName> thought we should
                            also take into account the various means of financing modernization. He
                            noted that if we should withdraw a division from Korea, there would be
                            approximately $550 million in stocks available to the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s; if Korea withdraws from Vietnam they
                            would bring their equipment back with them; we could also look to excess
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> equipment in Vietnam as
                            Vietnamization progresses. He thought we should consider all of these
                            funding sources in view of the severe constraints on grant <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lindjord referred to the increased flexibility if we should bring
                            some 2 <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> divisions back from Korea and
                            said this would be true only if we kept the divisions in being and did
                            not disband them.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> replied that the
                            only point in their withdrawal would be if they were to be
                            disbanded.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJR1">Schlesinger</persName> thought they might
                            be retained “in low profile.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lindjord asked if the Japanese would not be concerned if we took
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troops out of Korea.</p>
                        <p>General Unger thought they would.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said we would want
                            to have the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> analysis of the force
                            figures by February 13. We would plan to have another Review Group

                            <item>(S) The premise in <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss>–27 that a
                                reduced number of improved and modernized divisions could equate to
                                a somewhat larger number of unmodernized divisions is to some extent
                                valid. However, it must be recognized that there are definite limits
                                to which equipment improvement can offset reduction in force,
                                particularly in the case of infantry divisions. The type of

                                Comments on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Troop Withdrawals from
                                Korea</item>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> reported that
                            there had been a session that day at State on the position State would
                            take at the March 4 <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting on
                            Korea, in which the group had recommended that withdrawals be expressed
                            in terms of figures rather than units. This would be more meaningful, as
                            a division under certain circumstances could amount to as few as 12,000
                            men. The Secretary had not commented on this, but took up the proposal
                            that the first slice should be 20,000 men, with 20,000 more to be
                            withdrawn after the two <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions
                            came back from Vietnam. The thought was to let the generals strip off
                            the figures, but keep as much muscle in Korea as possible. Two-thirds of
                            the division on the line would be taken and sent home, which would give
                            8 to 10,000 of the 20,000 figure; 10,000 more would be stripped from the
                            rear areas and service troops. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s
                            would be left to handle the increased defense responsibility. State’s
                            position on this, according to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1"
                                >Porter</persName>, was to support 16 modernized <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions, not 18.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> observed that the
                            reasoning of the Joint Chiefs eluded him—their position was that 18
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions could hold a North
                            Korean and Chinese attack, but that 16 divisions plus <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces couldn’t do a thing. To a remark
                            from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> that
                            modernization of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions would
                            increase their effective strength a great deal, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted that the Joint Chiefs
                            argue two <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and 18 unmodernized <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions or one <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> and 18 modernized divisions are needed, but that one
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> division and 16 modernized <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions can’t do the job. This could
                            not be true. Their figures ought to be internally consistent. He had
                            looked through their figures, but could not determine what thought
                            processes had been used to reach their conclusion.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> recalled that in
                            the last withdrawals which we had made in 1954 and 1955, we had taken
                            out a total of six divisions, two corps headquarters, and non-divisional
                            units. At that time there had been 40,000 men in a division. Now we were
                            talking about a 12,000-man division withdrawal. This was a bare bones
                            cut.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> mentioned that when
                            General Bonesteel had spoken to the President—there had been two
                            sessions—the President had been inclined to be helpful, but had been
                            turned off by Bonesteel’s presentation. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> said that Bonesteel’s line with
                            him in Korea was to preserve, and not to tear down; he had replied that
                            he had simply wanted to get the fat out of our commitment.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that he
                            understood there was a disagreement between Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> and the military on the size of
                            the force which we should retain on the line. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> responded to <pb n="140"
                                xml:id="pg_140" facs="0167"/>the effect that the military wanted
                            sufficient forces to support any one point such as Panmunjom at any one
                            time. The military wanted a brigade. He thought, however, that a
                            battalion at Panmunjom would be sufficient to fulfill our responsibility
                            of guarding the <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> meeting place. This
                            could come from the 7th Division, which with the addition of one brigade
                            from the division being sent home could rotate battalions to the <gloss
                                target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and have enough strength at any one
                            time to back this battalion up. As for the rest of the line, we could
                            let the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s take over. They already
                            have seven-eighths of it.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> when the scenario
                            should be started. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1"
                                >Porter</persName> replied that the discussions with the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s should be begun right away before the
                            Presidential election campaign opens, which would be in the Fall after
                            the nominating conventions. He wanted the essentials made known to the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s and tied down so that the issue
                            would not bob up in the election campaign. If the process starts after
                            the campaign begins, there would be an effort to hold us off until the
                            elections, which are now scheduled for May 1971, were over. He would
                            like to go back to Seoul on Friday<note n="2" xml:id="d54fn2">March
                                6.</note> with approved instructions.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said he doubted the
                            instructions would be approved so soon and noted that the President
                            usually waits to make a decision until after the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> meeting is over. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1"
                                >Porter</persName> remarked that the sooner we begin, the better. He
                            would like to see General <persName corresp="#p_MJH1"
                                >Michaelis</persName> begin listing the matériel we would leave
                            behind for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s, and then move into
                            discussions of further phases of modernization, so as to provide time
                            for Washington to consider the extra steps which would be needed. The
                            first modernization step would be from equipment already there, and the
                            second might be from what the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops
                            in Vietnam brought back with them. If President <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> were to ask us what we intended to
                            do, we could say that so much was ready, and continue to negotiate from
                            there.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that the
                            decisions might be made in perhaps two weeks. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> declared that this was
                            acceptable. He was not thin-skinned, and it wouldn’t bother him if the
                            Koreans jumped around a bit. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>
                            was rather expecting an early decision, but could be put off. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> hoped that the
                            decision might even be made on March 4. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> said that in any case he felt it
                            was better to move, and get <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                            >Park</persName>’s comments so we could see what we could do.</p>
                        <p>Following a brief exchange on who would be attending the March 4 <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> asked Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> what kind of <pb n="141"
                                xml:id="pg_141" facs="0168"/>information he might send in from Korea
                            which would be helpful. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> remarked that he had been very interested in
                            the materials which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1"
                                >Porter</persName> had been sending back. He didn’t usually comment,
                            but read it all. He cited an account of a Vladivostok radio broadcast on
                            My Lai which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>
                            had forwarded; this had come in very useful in a recent meeting with
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, who had been amazed
                            that we had picked up Vladivostok radio. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> said that he often saw things
                            which were outside his own bailiwick but which he thought might be
                            interesting, and would send them back in bits and pieces. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> urged Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> to send in anything he
                            considered significant. He trusted <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1"
                                >Porter</persName>’s judgment, and would make an effort to read his
                            reports if the Ambassador was willing to write them down.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked for Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>’s views on Vietnam.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> expressed the
                            opinion that the Communists were preparing for another effort. They
                            would let us pull down our forces, and then have a go. They would have
                            to do this—the leaders up North were finding it hard to envisage peace,
                            and “their lives were at stake”, i.e. they had imposed too many
                            casualties on the North to be able to stop now. There would probably be
                            another effort by the Communists to catch a government unit in an
                            isolated position. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            characteristically work on some <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            unit out in front, watching its officers’ movements, picking out its
                            weak points, and working full time to lay out their plans. They badly
                            need a win because of the trouble they are now in, and would try to
                            achieve a psychological victory by catching a battalion and decimating
                            it. They would carefully select units to attack which are in areas from
                            which the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has withdrawn. We would
                            simply have to face this situation.</p>
                        <p>Continuing, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>
                            commented that Senator <persName corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName>
                            had wanted him to talk about Vietnam and the Middle East, but that he
                            had refused on the grounds that these questions were outside his area of
                            responsibility. On Korea, <persName corresp="#p_FJW1"
                                >Fulbright</persName> had inquired into nuclear weapons, and had
                            gone on and on about them. He had told the Senator that he had no
                            instructions to talk about nuclear weapons, to which <persName
                                corresp="#p_FJW1">Fulbright</persName> had accused him of “taking
                            the Fifth”. He had responded by expressing the hope that the Senator
                            would not draw this comparison too far. He had thought that the Senator
                            would never let go.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> would need to be
                            reconfirmed if he were appointed to another post, to which the
                            Ambassador said that he thought this would be no problem. The Senator’s
                            area of concern had really been the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>,
                            and he, <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>, felt that the
                            hearings had gone quite well. Surprisingly, Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_SS1">Symington</persName> had wanted to let the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s loose against the North.</p>
                        <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0169"/>
                        <p>Turning back to the troop withdrawal issue, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> expressed the belief that we
                            could swing the option which we wanted. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>s would go into their usual banging tactics, but could
                            be held. They would want us to modernize their forces first and then
                            withdraw, but we should do both concurrently. He urged that the
                            commanding general in Korea be given the authority to arrange these
                            matters. This would strengthen his hand with respect to <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>, who wanted to run everything
                            himself, and who customarily took the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                >JCS</gloss> view. However, he had every confidence that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJH1">Michaelis</persName> would be able to strip off
                            the forces properly, and would also go further than the <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> would in this effort.</p>

                        <p>The meeting was convened at 9:40 a.m. by the President. He called upon

                            <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>: During 1969 North Korea
                            has retrenched in its unconventional warfare operations against South
                            Korea. The North Koreans <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0170"/>have
                            considerable conventional naval and air power which was modernized by
                            Soviet equipment between 1966 and 1968. North Korean ground forces are
                            equipped with what is primarily obsolete Soviet equipment. They total 25
                            divisions of which 14 are forward along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1"
                                >DMZ</gloss>. Reportedly this year they have reduced their strength
                            by [<hi rend="italic">to</hi>?] 350,000 as compared to South Korean
                            forces of over half a million. The North Koreans are short on
                            transportation but strong in modern air power. One of the most
                            significant factors in the North Korean force posture has been the
                            impact of maintaining this force upon North Korea’s economic
                            development. Between 15 and 20 percent of North Korea’s gross national
                            product is allocated to Defense and over 20 percent of North Korea’s
                            males are in uniform contributing to a severe labor shortage.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> estimated that North Korea
                            has no intention of initiating conventional operations against South
                            Korea in the foreseeable future, adding that neither the Soviets nor the
                            Chinese Communists are encouraging such operations. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il Sung</persName>’s strategy in the
                            unconventional warfare area commenced in 1964 when he initiated the
                            intensifying <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> campaign against the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. This campaign was probably
                            initiated to discourage U.S. support for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>, especially as a result of U.S. domestic reaction. By
                            1969, however, <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Sung</persName> was
                            unsuccessful in generating dissonance in South Korea and thus decided on
                            a change in tactics if not strategy. 1969 reflected the lowest incident
                            rate of <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> harassments of any period
                            since 1964. While <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Sung</persName> has not
                            renounced violence, he appears to be shifting away from this tactic.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> are now better prepared than in
                            the past to counter North Korean <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss>
                            initiatives. They have developed a sophisticated counter-infiltration
                            system which includes a national coordinating committee and ancillary
                            operational control centers. The coastal surveillance capabilities have
                            been markedly improved and they have constituted 20 counter infiltration
                            battalions backed up by efficient <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            militia. Perhaps the major factor in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> effectiveness has been the dislike of the South Koreans
                            for the <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Sung</persName> regime and the
                            establishment of strong anti subversion laws.</p>
                        <p>President: The President then asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> to review the options available for future
                            U.S. military presence in South Korea.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> pointed out that there had
                            been two concurrent studies on our defense posture in South Korea: one
                            within the interdepartmental framework and the second a systems analysis
                            type study conducted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d55fn2">See <ref target="#d52">Document 52</ref>.</note> He
                            emphasized that <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0171"/>while the
                            conclusions were not identical, they were nearly parallel. U.S. military
                            strength in Korea totalled some 64,000. The present combined strength
                            consists of 20-1/3 <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions of
                            which 2-1/3 are in South Vietnam. Thus, the total posture includes 18
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> active divisions plus 2 U.S.
                            divisions. The combined strength outnumbers the North Koreans almost two
                            to one; although North Korea is much stronger than the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> in both air and sea power. The <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> supports its combat soldiers at
                            approximately twice the level of the North Koreans. Our studies
                            considered two scenarios: one would provide an analysis of forces
                            required to defend against only a North Korean attack. The second
                            considered the first requirement to meet a combined North Korean/<gloss
                                target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> attack. Against the North Korean attack
                            alone the combined U.S.–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force levels
                            could withstand such an attack and halt it north of Seoul. Against a
                            combined North Korean/<gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> attack the 18
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions, together with the two
                            U.S. divisions, could sufficiently delay such an attack until additional
                            forces could be deployed.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> emphasized that
                            there was some disagreement on how many <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> divisions were actually needed to maintain a sustained
                            defense against an attack emanating from North Korea alone. He pointed
                            out that the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe 19 <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> divisions were necessary and that others felt a force
                            level somewhat lower would be satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> emphasized that we

                        </p>
                        <p>He pointed out that the Joint Chiefs of Staff disagreed with postures 4
                            and 5 above. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> also
                            emphasized that the problem is not one of purely military strength but
                            also has definite political overtones. It is likely that the U.S.
                            military could be reduced to 1/3 division plus 19 improved <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions. However, the problem
                            involves the impact on deterrents and what level of U.S. presence is
                            necessary to insure that the North Koreans remain deterred. A second
                            factor is the problem of costs which were summarized on the Table at Tab
                                A.<note n="3" xml:id="d55fn3">Attached but not printed.</note>
                            Another factor impinging upon costs would be the status of the forces
                            removed from Korea; for example, if we removed 20,000 troops we would
                            realize savings of $20 million. If these troops were held on active
                            duty, on the other hand, our savings would be $450 million if they were
                            deactivated.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> also emphasized that
                            for the time being we should attempt to keep <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces in Vietnam and that our actions in South <pb
                                n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0172"/>Korea could influence their
                            willingness to do so. An additional problem involves the positioning of
                            our remaining U.S. forces. Presently there is one division on line and
                            one back. The question now is should we pull back from the <gloss
                                target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> to reduce friction or should we draw
                            forces from both the line and the rear. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> pointed out that most disagreed that we should
                            thin out our forces on the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> but keep
                            some combat power south of Panmumjom. State favors a force of only one
                            battalion, while the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> favors a
                            brigade-sized force. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines not declassified</hi>] A
                            final question would involve the magnitude of our counter insurgency
                            programs. The big issue, however, is the degree of U.S. presence
                            involving answers to the following specific questions: <list>

                            involves a decision as to whether or not we should consult before their
                            presidential elections or wait until after the elections.</p>

                                corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> stated that the <gloss

                            should be 1-1/3 U.S. divisions plus 18 improved <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> divisions, plus modernization of <gloss

                                >ROK</gloss>. He emphasized that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> equipment is deteriorating and that North Korean air
                            strength poses a considerable threat.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> stated that State
                            favors a drawdown of U.S. strength in two phases. The first phase would
                            be an immediate drawdown and the second would be additional reductions
                            after the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions return from
                            Vietnam. He emphasized that State preferred to see U.S. troops withdrawn
                            by numbers rather than by designated division or TONE unit. State also
                            favors consultations immediately. The size of the reductions should
                            depend on the assistance we can give to the modernization of the <gloss

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PD1">Packard</persName> emphasized that
                            the important problem is Congressional willingness to support 18 or 19
                            improved <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions. He stated that
                            if we draw down now we must have provided for the modernization of the

                            strong forces nearby in the Far East, pointing out that Asian leaders
                            are very fearful of U.S. intentions. The President stated that the Vice
                            President’s remarks were very pertinent, and we cannot give the
                            impression that we are leaving the area. Thus we need careful thought on
                            how to do it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> added that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> applauded the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine but added:
                            “Don’t do it to me.”</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_REL1"
                                >Richardson</persName> stated that we should not think that our
                            forces in Korea are available for deployment elsewhere. The President
                            stated that the best way to accomplish our reduction is to get President
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> to ask for it. He
                            inquired of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>
                            whether or not this could be done. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> responded affirmatively, adding
                            that we could probably get <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>
                            to do so providing we can give him assurances on modernization.</p>
                        <p>The President stated we must not weaken our forces there precipitously.
                            It is simply a question of U.S. support of U.S. divisions.</p>
                        <p>

                                >Lincoln</persName> added that in late 1947 we reduced our strength
                            and the North Koreans attacked. Under Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_PD1">Packard</persName> stated that we must have a

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated we must
                            decide on the level of our reduction, then the Under Secretaries
                            Committee can prepare a game plan on how to proceed to include
                            instructions to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>
                            and General <persName corresp="#p_MJH1">Michaelis</persName>. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> added it should be a
                            tentative decision since consultation may result in problems with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> or the
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President cautioned that what we draw down will never go back
                            and the President agreed, adding that we should keep in mind that [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line not declassified</hi>]. The President
                            stated we might consider increments of 10,000 now and 10,000 later, with
                            the support needed under such a procedure. The President stated that
                            this is the first five-year perceptive study. We have had 64,000 troops
                            in Korea since 1953 and someone should have looked at it long before
                            now. We must stop temporizing with these issues and must view the
                            problem from the long range. In essence, what we are looking for is not
                            a way to get out of Korea but a way to be able to stay in by means of a
                            long-range, viable posture. We are faced with increasing emphasis on
                            domestic spending here at home. Thus, we have to find a way to continue
                            playing a role by drawing down our strength somewhat or else the
                            Congress will refuse to support anything.</p>

                                that this should in no way be interpreted as a withdrawal from or
                                abandonment of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> but was simply a

                                for quick reinforcement would continue to constitute effective

                                successes, etc., etc. Without ever explicitly saying so, I tried and
                                believe I was successful in leaving <persName>Kim</persName> with

                        <p>I have received and studied carefully your letter of April 20<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d58fn2">See <ref target="#d57">Document 57</ref>.</note>
                            commenting on my proposal, presented through Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>, to withdraw 20,000 United
                            States troops from Korea by the end of June 1971. Let me in this
                            response put my proposal in perspective.</p>
                        <p>In our discussions during your visit to California last August,<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d58fn3">See <ref target="#d35">Document
                                35</ref>.</note> I explained my policy toward Asia, and I greatly
                            appreciated then as I do now your agreement with its fundamental
                            features. The maintenance of treaty obligations is basic to this policy.
                            Specifically, so far as Korea is concerned, the United States is
                            committed in the case of armed attack against your country to act in
                            accordance with the Mutual Defense Treaty between our Governments. All
                            the world, and specifically North Korea and Communist China, are aware
                            of this. That commitment was reaffirmed in our meeting.</p>
                        <p>It is also my policy that as the strengths and capabilities of our Allies
                            increase it is reasonable to expect them to assume more of the
                            responsibility for their own defense and specifically to provide the
                            bulk of the manpower required for that purpose.</p>
                        <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0180"/>
                        <p>Over the past several years the Republic of Korea under your leadership
                            has made great progress in developing its economic and military
                            strength, progress completely overshadowing that of the North. The
                            contribution made by your military forces in Vietnam attests to this
                            remarkable development. Despite this increased economic and military
                            strength, the number of American troops in the Republic has not declined
                            from the level which prevailed when the Republic was far less able to
                            assume the primary burden for its defense. In fact, the number today is
                            somewhat larger than that prevailing at any time over the past ten
                            years.</p>
                        <p>I am not proposing a total withdrawal of United States forces such as the
                            one in 1949 to which you referred in your letter. On the contrary, the
                            20,000 men to be withdrawn constitute less than one-third of our current
                            forces in the Republic of Korea. The forces remaining will provide not
                            only substantial United States military capacity but also clear evidence
                            of a United States commitment. So far as a deterrent is concerned, it
                            will remain clear to North Korea and to Communist China that the United
                            States has not retreated from Korea or the Pacific area.</p>
                        <p>I recognize that the level of military assistance for Korea provided by
                            the Congress under the last military assistance appropriation has been
                            less than we considered desirable. Part of the reason for the
                            Congressional attitude towards military assistance has undoubtedly been
                            a feeling by the Congress and the public that with the progress made by
                            recipients of such assistance they should assume a greater share of the
                            responsibility for their own defense.</p>
                        <p>Subject to Congressional approval, I propose to provide substantially
                            higher military assistance over the period 1971–75 for Korean
                            modernization. Moreover, provided your Government assumes a larger
                            defense burden we are also prepared to consider some increased economic
                            assistance. This assistance would be available during the very period
                            which you see as crucial to Korea’s continuing economic progress and
                            protection from the North.</p>
                        <p>I plan to brief the Congress on my proposal and seek to enlist their
                            support so that the processes of modernization of the Korean armed
                            forces can begin as soon as possible. An initiative from you showing
                            that Korea is ready to assume more of the burden of its own defense will
                            add to Korea’s image and to Congressional and public support for these
                            greater appropriations.</p>
                        <p>You may be assured, Mr. President, that I would not have made this
                            proposal except after the most careful study of all the factors involved
                            and specifically of those mentioned in your letter. I would not have
                            made it had I believed that it would adversely affect the Republic of
                            Korea which we consider so important to the security of Asia and of the
                            Free World, and in which we have such an immense national
                            investment.</p>
                        <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0181"/>
                        <p>Therefore, Mr. President, I hope that you will be able to agree that my
                            proposal is in the interests of both our countries and that you will
                            find it possible to take the lead in presenting it to your country and
                            to the world as a natural and proud consequence of the remarkable
                            progress achieved by your country.</p>

                                not say what had been said before. I replied that it was essentially
                                carefully considered reply to points he had raised and in my view we
                                should work together in cooperative and forward-looking fashion.

                                forces is concerned we can start to develop them any time, but he
                                must know amount of program before he can judge whether he can take
                                lead as we desire. Until he knows nature and extent of modernization
                                he cannot agree to any withdrawals.</item>

                            <item>I said we understand his natural desire to know dimensions of what
                                we can do. On other hand, we are asking him to support our approach
                                to Congress and to his people so that we can get things under way
                                and develop a program. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>
                                replied we must understand his position. If he agreed to take
                                initiative before knowing how much, when, etc., his people would ask
                                him those questions and he could not answer. If he could say only
                                vaguely that there would be adequate program and troops were being
                                withdrawn, Korean people would feel unsafe and his position would be
                                difficult. A year ago, Koreans had submitted program proposal.<note
                                    n="6" xml:id="d59fn6">See <ref target="#d21fn2">footnote 2,
                                        Document 21</ref>.</note> If that had been accepted it would
                                now be possible to consider whether time frame for withdrawal could
                                be changed from 1975 to earlier date. That program should be
                                reviewed. From his point of view there are too many unknowns. It was
                                not necessary to talk about amount of money involved as equipment is
                                important aspect. He cannot take initiative on present basis. In his
                                letter he had asked reconsideration of withdrawal until 1975, and if
                                Korean program mentioned in his letter of April 1969 to President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> could be approved
                                he could then consider changing date when some U.S. troops might
                                depart.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>I said we were both talking about substantial programs which over
                                five-year period might cost billion dollars or more. He was right to
                                say we should not be talking amounts of money but rather types and
                                amount of material involved. We want to get down to real discussions
                                with his people to determine exactly what is involved. It would
                                first be necessary to brief Congress to get acceptance in principle
                                for modernization program and if <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                    >Park</persName> would assist by taking lead in suggesting some
                                of our troops could leave it would, as letter pointed out, greatly
                                add to Korea’s image before Congress and American people
                                generally.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> said we should sit down
                                with Koreans and develop program before going to Congress. If we
                                would do that it might be possible for troops to leave before 1975
                                    (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>). I replied it seemed necessary to
                                us to get principle accepted first by Congressional leadership
                                rather than go and give them very large program on platter and say
                                that’s it. It was best to leave to us procedures and psychological
                                aspects of handling things in U.S. I continued that in view of his
                                references to fact that his date for departure, 1975, might be
                                subject to change and that troops “might leave” before then, I would
                                like to clarify point. We were asking his support with Korean public
                                and U.S. Congress for idea that some troops might leave in view of
                                fact that substantial modernization program was envisaged. We were
                                not asking permission for troops to <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156"
                                    facs="0183"/>leave, as there was no requirement on us in that
                                sense. We were required to consult with him and that is what we are
                                doing. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> said he
                                understood that his agreement, or concurrence, is required before we
                                can withdraw troops. I replied that obviously we could not and did
                                not give even government as friendly as that of Korea control over
                                movement of our troops, and that as there seemed to be some
                                misunderstanding on that point it was just as well that it came up
                                now. Consultation is required of us, but that is different matter, I
                                said. (This part of conversation was, like rest, in even
                                tones.)</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>I continued by saying we were faced with practical problem as to
                                how to reply if and when congressional leadership inquired as to
                                President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s attitude
                                toward withdrawal of American troops. I suggested that in view of
                                importance of giving Congress right impression, it would be
                                appropriate for President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                    >Park</persName> to authorize statement to be used as necessary
                                along these lines: “When President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                    >Park</persName> knows there will be an adequate modernization
                                program and knows its dimensions he will be able to reassure his
                                people in those circumstances that some American troops can be
                                withdrawn.” Some such statement would be helpful to some degree even
                                though it not as forthcoming as we would desire. After congressional
                                approval in principle obtained, we could try to develop in detail
                                substantial program which had been proposed to him. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> asked whether such statement
                                would be made publicly or privately. I said that during initial
                                period we would try to handle it as he desired. He reflected for few
                                moments and said he didn’t want to authorize anything, but we could
                                use sense of his views which was along lines of above-quoted
                                suggestion. I said this purely my own suggestion and I could not say
                                whether it would appear useful in Washington.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>I said there was another point I wished to go over. Modernization
                                program is result of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> desire to
                                reassure <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> and people of our
                                continuing concern for their safety, even though we are withdrawing
                                some troops. Program and withdrawal are therefore related but are
                                not dependent one on the other. We wish to see program get underway
                                when and as we withdraw, but each will have its own pace. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> did not respond to this aspect
                                of things.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>President then reviewed many of his earlier remarks on subject of
                                need for American patience. It was true there had been improvement
                                in military field, but that was true of enemy also. In economic
                                field, work had barely been started and average national income is
                                still only $200 per year. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s are
                                carrying great national defense burden but by 1975 they hope to
                                assume all of that burden over annual American <gloss
                                    target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> contribution of $150 million. On
                                point of withdrawal <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>
                                thought that perhaps this does not seem as serious in United States
                                as it does in Korea. At this critical moment Koreans hope for more
                                U.S. patience.</item>

                            <item>I commented that these factors had been given our most careful
                                attention as my President’s letter indicated. We are not

                                of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> people. We are extremely
                                mindful of proceeding in manner which will make it clear to them

                            <item>President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> then asked
                                if our people could commence talks on modernization program. I
                                replied that I thought Washington would wish to contact
                                congressional leadership first, which would be done very soon. We
                                could and would however make gesture at this time, which was to open

                                considered, though it would be handled somewhat differently from
                                other parts of that program. He then inquired whether we would build

                                disturbed to hear this morning statements made by high-level

                                What was explanation, he asked. I said I thought our officials, like
                                some of his own, were reacting to pressures from Congress, Assembly
                                and press. Comments on our side were no doubt intended to hold down
                                pressures in U.S., while his Ministers were also commenting in

                                argument with him. I suggest we keep it cool, continue our planning,
                                and give this problem appearance of one wherein we have met our
                                obligation to consult with him. We should continue to tell him that
                                we have carefully considered his views, and he will hear from us as
                                our efforts to build up his forces proceed, and as our plans develop
                                in matter of force reduction.</item>

                            <item>His recalcitrance is true reflection of his present outlook: we
                                must meet his wishes; our problems are not controlling, not even
                                when they involve our men, our money, our markets and our materials.
                                He has quite deliberately pushed campaign to assure his people that
                                we cannot reduce our forces in any degree without his consent; and
                                that we have not notified him of any such intention. He has now gone
                                so far in this process that he may be developing first real threat
                                to his own reelection next year when it becomes clear that his
                                Ministers have been less than frank with Assembly and public. He
                                will sense need, especially if we proceed calmly toward our
                                objective, to repair his fences and reduce his political
                                vulnerability by at least pretending some degree of accord with us.
                                In addition to course suggested in para one above, we should let him
                                know that his people will inevitably acquire correct picture of our
                                obligations, our proposals, and our attachment to their future. It
                                seems clear that we sould not leave pace to <persName

                            <item>I think he will sooner or later develop idea of sending mission to
                                Washington to argue matters with us. Possibly he would use both
                                Prime Minister and Defense Minister for that purpose. If they failed
                                to change our position, system here, as you know, would make them
                                responsible for “failure.” I assume you would prefer to discourage
                                thoughts about such a mission when and if they appear.</item>

                        <p>“However, inasmuch as you are proposing to me a partial reduction of the
                            United States forces in Korea in line with your policy of generally
                            reducing United States troops stationed abroad, I think it is in the
                            interests of both of our governments to express clearly and frankly my
                            views and positions and problems related to such reduction.</p>
                        <p>“The United States forces in Korea serve as a most effective deterrent
                            against the potential aggressors and also as an indispensable element of
                            the defense posture in the case of an armed attack from the north. Any
                            reduction should, therefore, be accompanied by positive measures of
                            strengthening the Republic of Korea forces to offset the effect of such
                            reduction lest it should result in weakening the deterrent or defense
                            capability. It is to be added that major part, if not all, of such
                            measures should be implemented in advance.</p>
                        <p>“As for the modernization of the Republic of Korea forces as an effective
                            means of strengthening them, it is to be reminded that the ‘Counter
                            Infiltrations/Guerrilla Forces Improvement Requirements’ and the
                            ‘Republic of Korea Forces Development Objectives Plan’ were submitted to
                            your government on January 9 and June 7, 1969, respectively.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d61fn3">Neither paper was found.</note> I have instructed my
                            Minister of National Defense to integrate these two plans into a single
                            five-year (1971–1975) overall modernization plan, which, I understand,
                            is being submitted to your government through the Commander, United
                            States Forces in Korea, as of this date.</p>
                        <p>“I think that consultations should be made on the requirements as well as
                            the ways and means of implementing this overall and substantial
                            modernization. Consultations should also be made on the problem of
                            regular military assistance and on the question of whether it would be
                            necessary to increase the level of the Republic of Korea forces. <pb

                            of developing defense industries in Korea should also be explored. It is
                            strongly hoped that firm assurances in advance will be made by your
                            government with regard to these problems.</p>
                        <p>“As regards the United States forces in Korea, assuming any partial
                            reduction should take place, problems concerning its size and timing as
                            well as the maintenance of the present structure of the United States
                            forces in Korea should be the subjects of consultation. At the same
                            time, consideration should be given to the necessity of strengthening
                            the disposition of naval and air forces of the United States in and
                            around Korea.</p>
                        <p>“In case of reduction of the United States forces in Korea, there should

                            or eliminating its political and psychological adverse effects on the
                            people of the Republic of Korea. Such measures would help to relieve the
                            apprehensions of the Korean people as to their future security and, more
                            importantly, to prevent the danger of irrevocable calamities which might
                            be caused by miscalculation on the part of the potential aggressors, the
                            North Korean and Chinese Communists, as to the the capability or
                            determination of our two nations to take common measures to meet their
                            aggression.</p>
                        <p>“The importance of fulfilling the treaty obligation of your government in
                            the defense of the Republic of Korea is also pointed out in your letter.
                            There should be a reaffirmation of the determination of the United
                            States to take effective and prompt measures, including the dispatch and
                            reinforcement of ground troops, in the case of renewed aggression in the
                            Korean Peninsula. The potential aggressors should be given a clear and
                            stern warning about such determination of the United States.</p>
                        <p>“The United States has consistently supported the objective of the United
                            Nations in Korea to realize ‘a unified, independent and democratic
                            Korea.’ And, it goes without saying that the mainstay of the United
                            Nations forces, which constitute an indispensable factor for the
                            maintenance of peace in the Korean Peninsula, consists of the United
                            States forces in Korea. Accordingly, it should be reaffirmed that the
                            partial reduction of the United States forces in Korea would in no way
                            affect the role of the United Nations forces in Korea and that until
                            such time as the above-mentioned objective of the United Nations in
                            Korea is accomplished, the United States forces, which form the nucleus
                            of the United Nations forces in Korea, will certainly continue to be
                            stationed in Korea at a level of powerful and substantial strength.</p>
                        <p>“I consider it of utmost importance for our two governments to take
                            diplomatic steps to arrange for a system of close and full consultations
                            on the implementation of the Mutual Defense Treaty between our two
                            countries and related matters.</p>

                            military, economic and diplomatic measures referred to above, such
                            safeguards would be instrumental in seeking the understanding of the
                            Korean people, who are so strongly opposed to any reduction of the
                            United States forces in Korea. On my part, it would be impossible to
                            persuade the Korean people to accept the partial withdrawal by the end
                            of June 1971, as mentioned in your letter,<note n="4" xml:id="d61fn4">

                            unexpected shock it would give to them and the shortness of time
                            involved. Apart from this point, if the above-mentioned accord be firmly
                            reached, my government will then be prepared to have discussions with
                            some flexibility in regard to its basic position, explained in my

                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>’ conversation
                            that day with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CKH1">Foreign Minister Choi</persName>, in which
                            the latter called under instructions from President <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> to express shock over a telegram
                            presented to him by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1"
                                >Porter</persName> putting forward a “deadline” to effectuate U.S.
                            troop reductions. Since there has been no telegram from State telling
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> to pass the
                            word to <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> in this way (at
                            least in regular channels), it is conceivable that Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> may attribute <persName
                                corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>’s actions to instructions sent
                            him by someone else, e.g. the White House. This could become a
                            troublesome issue, given President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName>’s temperament and strong objections to U.S. troop
                            reductions, as is amply brought out in the rest of the telegram.</p>
                        <p>In piecing together what may have happened, I believe it is highly likely
                            that the prime mover in this series of events was Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> himself. At Tab B is a telegram
                            from Saigon describing the Secretary’s previous conversation with
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKH1">Foreign Minister Choi</persName> on July
                            3, in which the Secretary really laid it on the line to <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKH1">Choi</persName> to the effect that we had already
                            made a decision to reduce our forces in Korea, that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> was “instructed on the details,”
                            and that it “was necessary to agree immediately on troop reductions.”
                            You will note that this telegram was sent to Seoul for information on
                            July 6 and that its transmission time was 3 hours and 20 minutes earlier
                            than the telegram at Tab A (1300 <gloss target="#t_Z1">Z</gloss> versus
                            1620 <gloss target="#t_Z1">Z</gloss>.) Thus there was plenty of time for
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>, who already
                            was “instructed on the details,” to take this line from the Secretary as
                            his marching orders and go to <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> on his own initiative. Everything which the
                            Secretary said on July 3 is consistent with what <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> chose to construe as a “deadline”
                            on effectuating U.S. troop reductions. While Ambassador <persName

                                typed note indicates the letter was pouched on July 9. On June 19,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> sent a draft of

                                    >Kissinger</persName> stated that <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"

                                departure, which “might be as much as $2 billion or more,” and
                                assured the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> that the United

                                the issue in Korea in an attempt to block any withdrawal until after

                        <p>I have received and carefully considered your letter of June 15<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d64fn2">See <ref target="#d61">Document
                                61</ref>.</note> in which you comment further on my decision to
                            withdraw 20,000 United States troops from Korea by the end of June
                            1971.</p>
                        <p>The United States commitment to the defense of Korea, embodied in the
                            Mutual Defense Treaty between our Governments, was reaffirmed when we
                            met last in California during August 1969.<note n="3" xml:id="d64fn3"
                                >See <ref target="#d35">Document 35</ref>.</note> At that time we
                            agreed that the military forces of Korea and those of the United States
                            stationed in Korea must remain strong and alert. Most importantly, we
                            reaffirmed our determination to meet armed attack against Korea in
                            accordance with that Treaty.</p>
                        <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0192"/>
                        <p>As I said in my letter of May 26,<note n="4" xml:id="d64fn4">
                                <ref target="#d58">Document 58</ref>.</note> and as I have also
                            stated publicly, the maintenance of treaty obligations is a fundamental
                            principle of my policy toward Asia. In this you have my assurance in
                            both word and deed. Not only will the forces remaining in Korea provide
                            the powerful and substantial deterrent you seek, but the continued
                            United States presence among them will also serve as the best possible
                            demonstration to both friend and enemy of our commitment to Korea’s
                            defense and security.</p>
                        <p>I am fully sympathetic, of course, to your position that any reduction of
                            United States forces be accompanied by a strengthening of the Republic
                            of Korea Forces. As you know from my letter, this is basic to my plan.
                            The United States will provide, subject to Congressional approval, a
                            compensatory increase in military assistance for Korea for the purpose
                            of modernizing your military forces. To bring this about I intend to
                            brief leaders of Congress on these plans as soon as possible in order to
                            obtain their support so that modernization can begin.</p>
                        <p>It is my earnest desire, Mr. President, that we move forward together. I
                            believe the time has now come for our representatives to sit down
                            together and discuss my program and the necessary modernization of your
                            military forces. The Republic of Korea Forces Development Objectives
                            Plan has been very helpful in assisting our planning for Korean
                            modernization requirements, and we shall look forward to receiving your
                            Government’s five year overall modernization plan to which you refer in
                            your letter. Simultaneous with such discussions, I hope you will find it
                            possible to take the initiative in presenting my decision to your
                            countrymen.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MJH1">Michaelis</persName> have suggested that
                            one way for us to ease President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName>’s political problems over U.S. troop reductions
                            would be to retain both U.S. divisions in a “re-aligned” configuration
                            involving the replacement of U.S. brigades being withdrawn by <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> brigades. Divisional command would be
                            retained by the U.S. (See Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1"
                                >Porter</persName>’s back-channel message at Tab B.)<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d65fn2">Dated July 1, attached but not printed.</note> You
                            have asked if we could do this.</p>
                        <p>Theoretically speaking, there would appear to be no reason why the
                            re-alignment suggested by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1"
                                >Porter</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_MJH1"
                                >Michaelis</persName> cannot be carried out. There is a long history
                            of Koreans serving with American units under U.S. command, dating all
                            the way back to the Korean war. “KATUSAs” (Korean Army troops assigned
                            to U.S. Army units) still are a feature of our forces in Korea, and the
                            addition of two <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> brigades to a U.S.
                            division to replace two U.S. brigades would not be a vast change from
                            this pattern. If it would meet President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName>’s political desiderata of retaining what could be
                            described as two U.S. divisions, we would want to consider carrying this
                            recommendation out.</p>
                        <p>However, information which has just been provided by Defense on our
                            proposed troop reductions indicates that one entire division is to be
                            withdrawn along with Army and Corps supporting units, leaving one
                            division consisting of eight maneuver battalions. The question here is
                            whether there would be enough of a U.S. framework remaining upon which a
                            mixed U.S.–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> division under U.S.
                            command could be assembled. It might be possible to apportion the U.S.
                            battalions in such a way as to provide a nucleus for two divisions, with
                            the rest made of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s, but I suspect
                            that Defense would balk at having U.S. forces in such a minority
                            position. This would also require around four <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> brigades, not the two which Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> and General <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJH1">Michaelis</persName> call for in their proposal.
                            Alternatively one mixed division could be assembled, leaving the U.S.
                            division considerably under <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0194"
                            />strength. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MJH1">Michaelis</persName> are evidently operating on
                            the assumption that two brigades from the U.S. 2nd Division are to be
                            removed, but that one will remain to which two <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> brigades could be added. I recall from earlier
                            discussions with Defense on U.S. force reductions in Korea that Defense
                            was thinking in such terms, but the signals appear to have been
                            switched. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> might
                            be asked if his proposal is fully compatible with the latest Defense
                            planning.</p>
                        <p>Assuming that this proposal is compatible with Defense planning, another
                            problem is involved: that of retaining U.S. forces along the <gloss
                                target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. One feature of the present reduction
                            plan is that with the exception of one company rotated to Panmunjom for
                            security duty from the remaining U.S. division, the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s would man the entire <gloss
                                target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. Under Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>’s concept, the two <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> brigades in the 2nd Division would
                            assume places on the line, thereby leaving what in name would be a full
                            U.S. division along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. The
                            advantages of a U.S. pull-back would then no longer obtain, i.e.
                            lowering the chances of a direct U.S.-North Korean confrontation from
                            the very outset of a significant North Korean military move across the
                                <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. I believe that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> might be asked for his
                            thoughts on this issue.</p>
                        <p>Another immediate problem I can foresee is the purely technical one of
                            getting Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>’s
                            message into regular instead of back channels. [<hi rend="italic">5

                        <p>Congressman Gallagher said that he will leave for Korea on Sunday, and
                            plans to stay there for four or five days. He may stop in Japan on the
                            way home, to see Expo 70. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> asked whether State had alerted our Embassies;
                            Mr. Gallagher did not think that it had, and Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GL1">Grant</persName> that this be done (<hi
                                rend="italic">Note:</hi> State has been advised). Congressman
                            Gallagher mentioned that he expects to be Chairman of the Far East
                            Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee next year unless
                            Zablocki wants the position again, which he doubts.</p>
                        <p>On Korea, Mr. Gallagher said that he had reliable information that the
                            Koreans were concerned that the Communists will act in concert against
                            South Korea within the next few years, because they fear that by 1975
                            the Japanese will be rearmed and will make any such action too
                            dangerous. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government is very
                            worried that the United States is giving the impression of a withdrawal.
                            It would like the U.S. Seventh Division to stay in Korea, if only in
                            cadre status, along with the Second Division. The Koreans understand
                            that this might leave only 42,000 American servicemen in Korea, but they
                            could put up with that if the two division organizations remained. Mr.
                            Gallagher understands that the Koreans would be willing to contribute
                            perhaps another 25,000 troops to Vietnam if the U.S. would agree to keep
                            the two divisions in Korea. Mr. Gallagher thought that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> is certain to raise this
                            proposal with him next week.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that we have a
                            paper before us right now as to what troops should be taken out. He had
                            heard through another channel of the proposal related by Mr. Gallagher.
                            It is an interesting one. It shows that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>s are displaying a positive attitude. The decision <pb
                                n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0196"/>is a technical one, and we are
                            looking into it; we may be able to accommodate their wishes. If we do,
                            the issue of additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces to
                            South Vietnam would not arise.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gallagher thought the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s might
                            still make the offer. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> said that at this stage we do not believe that
                            we need new foreign troops in Vietnam. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> has brought back an interesting
                            report of the increased confidence in Vietnam. The best threat we can
                            make to persuade Hanoi to negotiate may be that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> may be unbeatable alone. A year and a
                            half ago, this idea would have been inconceivable.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that it was
                            good to know of the approach to Mr. Gallagher, but he did not believe
                            that it would be useful for Mr. Gallagher to explore this exchange
                            proposal in Korea. He would, however, like Mr. Gallagher’s impressions
                            on his return. He suggested that Mr. Gallagher, while in Korea, make
                            clear that 42,000 is “still a big slice.” It is as good as 60,000 in
                            terms of guaranteeing the U.S. reaction if the Communists attack.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gallagher said that they didn’t seem worried about the numbers; they
                            were hung up on the question of the divisions. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> saw no objection in principle
                            to keeping the two divisions, but thought we might substitute Korean
                            troops to fill out the cadre division. This would of course raise
                            problems as to how to control their initiatives. Mr. Gallagher thought
                            that the Koreans want the cadre division but are not particularly
                            interested in fleshing it out with Korean troops.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that we want to
                            be helpful. The Koreans are good allies; the President had a good
                            meeting last August with President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName>. The shock of the proposed reduction is its
                            symbolism, but we will do the best we can.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> reiterated that we
                            share interests in common with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.
                            We are not trying to get out. The proposed reduction allows us to stay
                            longer by reducing U.S. domestic pressures against a major continued
                            U.S. presence. He hoped that Mr. Gallagher would relay this idea to the
                            Koreans. Mr. Gallagher said that this was precisely what he wanted to
                            get across to them and he wondered if Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> could provide him with that language in
                            writing. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed to
                            do so, and asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GL1">Grant</persName> to draw
                            up appropriate language (<hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> separately

                                statement reads: “The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government
                                regards the proposed reduction in its forces in Korea as a means of
                                assuring that it can continue to cooperate over the long term in
                                assuring Korean security, not as a means of withdrawing from its
                                obligations. The indefinite retention in Korea of some 62,000 troops
                                could be regarded as excessive, particularly in view of the absence
                                of active hostilities for over fifteen years. This could in turn
                                lead to domestic criticism of the continuing large-scale American
                                presence.” (National Archives, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"

                        <p>In a digression during the discussion of Korea, Congressman Gallagher
                            mentioned that he was a close friend of President Balaguer of the
                            Dominican Republic. He had helped to assure that Balaguer could remain
                            in the U.S., and had even found some funds to help support him, during a
                            time when President Bosch was putting pressure on us to have Balaguer
                            deported. Mr. Gallagher said that he has helped Balaguer’s government
                            and can perhaps be of help to us if something is needed from Balaguer or
                            if we need an intermediary with personal credit with him.</p>

                                required to bring their forces to a state at which genuine
                                modernization could begin. Coastal surveillance was a priority
                                requirement which would involve a squadron of S–2’s. They also asked

                                before this, and that they wanted a firm commitment that 60 percent

                                delivered in the first two years. He also wanted us to find some
                                way, such as a separate appropriation for Korea, which would
                                insulate the current Korean <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>

                                unacceptable. The defense burden on the Korean budget was already
                                great, 23 percent. He said they wanted <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                    >US</gloss> help in financing defense manufacturing industries
                                and providing raw materials for them. He asked for support of a
                                defense science research institute to be established in the Ministry
                                of Defense which would be the same character and “co-equal” with
                                    <gloss target="#t_KIST1">KIST</gloss>. He would like to get
                                about the same amount of aid for this new agency as <gloss
                                    target="#t_KIST1">KIST</gloss> had received. He was gratified to
                                hear that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> air units would be
                                stationed in Korea, but wanted firm assurance as to the disposition
                                of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> air and naval forces in the
                                area and assurances as to what counter-measures they would be
                                prepared to undertake in the event of North Korean
                                aggression.</item>

                            <item>In the diplomatic field, in order to cushion the shock of
                                reduction and maintain the deterrent, he had expected “faithful
                                fulfillment” of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> treaty
                                obligations, the assurance of the redeployment of <gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172"
                                    facs="0199"/>to Korea if the treaty had to be invoked, including
                                ground forces. He asked for “stern and forceful warning to North
                                Korea,” and assurance that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces
                                would stay in Korea in powerful and substantive strength until
                                unification was accomplished under the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >UN</gloss> formula. He requested assurance of close and full
                                consultation on the fulfillment of the defense treaty which would
                                involve, among other things, expansion of the annual Defense
                                Ministers meeting to include Foreign Ministers. He said that any
                                addition to the Korean defense budget, as would be involved in a
                                resumption of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer, would
                                impair <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> economic progress and
                                should not come until the Korea development program had proceeded
                                much further than it has today.</item>

                            <item>He said that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government
                                wanted these assurances first before reductions of forces in Korea
                                were discussed and that unless they had received sufficient
                                assurances in the defense, diplomatic and economic fields the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government could not concur in any
                                reductions. He remarked pointedly that a unilateral reduction “would
                                be very inappropriate.”</item>

                            <item>He said all of this with a straight face in spite of the fact that
                                it had been made clear to him in private conversations, prior to the
                                meeting and by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PD1"
                                    >Packard</persName> in the morning session that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss> decision to withdraw 20 thousand men
                                had been made and was firm.</item>

                            <item>The posture of the Korean delegation today had a strong flavor of
                                an aggrieved party who was being deprived of his rights by a
                                faithless friend.</item>

                            <item>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PD1">Packard</persName>’s
                                performance at this point was superb. Very quietly but very firmly
                                he reminded the Minister that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                                had maintained substantial <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces
                                in Korea for 17 years, that there were no Soviet or Chinese forces
                                in North Korea, and that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had
                                provided Korea with over 8 billion dollars in aid. He said that to
                                assume that Korea had not made enough progress to justify the
                                marginal decrease in forces which we were proposing was totally
                                unrealistic. For us to specify in advance the form of assistance
                                which we would render if our help were required under the treaty was
                                out of the question. We would live up to our commitment under the
                                treaty. We would provide appropriate help if required by our treaty
                                obligation. But we would not give any more assurances or assume any
                                additional commitments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PD1"
                                    >Packard</persName> noted that at this meeting we had recognized
                                the importance of solid defensive strength for the Korean forces. We
                                had reaffirmed our commitment under the treaty. We had accepted the
                                need to upgrade the Korean force’s equipment. We had moved to assure
                                more effective air support as that required. We had offered to give
                                them equipment from our departing troops which would provide them
                                with a capability equivalent to that of the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                    >US</gloss> forces which were leaving. If this were not
                                attractive to them we could easily take the equipment home or
                                dispose of it elsewhere. We intend to request a supplemental <pb

                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> appropriation. We were prepared
                                to examine the possibility of developing defense industry. We had
                                agreed to provide them with three S–2 planes within the new few
                                weeks.</item>

                            <item>We felt, therefore, that we had fully shown our good faith. There
                                was no possibility that we would make greater commitments or do more
                                than we had already outlined. It would be most unfortunate if there
                                should be a public confrontation between us. He hoped that we could
                                conclude our discussion on a note of progress and a picture of a
                                    <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> sympathetic to <gloss

                            <item>The Minister then said that it was clear that there were wide gaps
                                between us. He was not in a position to say “yes” or “no” to our
                                package proposal. Perhaps we should leave the points which had been
                                made for further discussion between our representatives in Seoul and
                                Washington.</item>

                                feels strongly on this subject. He does so not only in terms of his

                                what might happen to him if he doesn’t bring back a package

                                    >Porter</persName>, and a number of others have tried to show
                                him how what we have offered could be honestly and effectively
                                presented as a real achievement on his part and a reassurance to his
                                country-men, he refuses to see it this way. I think that he has
                                really persuaded himself that he is right in not doing so. It is
                                perhaps indicative of his mood that he told us at lunch today that
                                he had been reminded by various colleagues in the Korean Assembly
                                before he left for Honolulu of the story of a representative of an
                                ancient Korean king who, having been unable to get an opportunity to
                                speak at an international meeting on a matter of concern to his
                                monarch, had very appropriately committed hari-kari on the

                                two hours. As we gradually increased pressure on him, his position
                                on joint troop planning moved from adamant repetition of his earlier
                                refusals to countenance reduction of U.S. troops or to plan jointly
                                on that subject, to statement that he had instructed his Defense
                                Minister to do no such planning until “a degree of satisfaction” had
                                been achieved in modernization talks now underway.<note n="2"

                                somewhat by saying he had not yet received interim report of
                                modernization group and he would reserve his opinion on joint
                                planning on reductions until he had that, after which he would get
                                in touch with us. As result of problems we spread before him he
                                seemed more indecisive, albeit more truculent, as reality of U.S.
                                determination to proceed with or without his cooperation became
                                clearer to him. He reiterated all the “musts” and declared his
                                “displeasure” frequently. At no point did he acknowledge U.S.
                                gestures made at Honolulu. He excluded his Ministers from interview
                                despite Prime Minister’s statement to me that he would be present.
                                He had only two Blue House officials there, including

                            <item>I opened by saying we had requested interview for purpose of
                                examining our positions and of ascertaining how we could cooperate
                                during period ahead. I said problems are arising because of lack of
                                joint planning. Further, we hope to keep public contention and
                                difficulty, which would only complicate and endanger favorable
                                consideration of modernization problem by Congress, to minimum. We
                                were also hoping that clarifications we had provided at Honolulu had
                                made it possible to deal with these matters. Modernization talks are
                                under way and we believe they will produce useful picture of what is
                                needed. Is it now possible to move ahead on joint planning on our
                                troop reductions?</item>

                                no change in their attitude. His views had been made known to United
                                States at Honolulu. Nothing <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0202"
                                />could be done about troop reduction planning before achievement of
                                results at modernization conference and before “assurances”
                                concerning security could be given to Korean people. When those
                                things are achieved joint consultation could begin. He understood
                                U.S. problems, but there are similar or greater difficulties in
                                Korea. He had received letters which indicated Korean people 100 per
                                cent against reduction of U.S. troops. If reduction is to occur
                                there must be “assurances that there will be no outbreak of war in
                                Korea.” Unless there is some agreement of that kind he will not
                                agree to reductions. He understands there are serious and sincere
                                talks about modernization underway and he hopes they will provide
                                conclusion which will enable general public to feel secure. Only
                                then will he take part in reduction talks and only then will matters
                                of size, timing, and actions to be taken after agreement, be
                                discussed. He wanted to make clear at this point that <gloss

                                unless there is mutually acceptable conclusion of modernization

                            <item>I replied that there was no approved plan on troop reductions when
                                we asked <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> to plan jointly with
                                us. They felt unable to do that. Therefore we had to move in view of
                                our national sentiment, policy, budgetary and manpower
                                    considerations.<gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> may have
                                had good ideas but they would not present them in planning sessions.
                                For example, for lack of joint planning there is real problem about
                                disposition of equipment which may become available soon as result
                                of reductions. What are we to do with it? We cannot let it
                                deteriorate, and it is hard to imagine public reaction here or in
                                U.S. if <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> refusal to plan with
                                us makes it necessary to send it elsewhere. This very unfortunate.
                                List of equipment is impressive, there are hundreds of tanks for <pb

                                not depend so much on Mutual Defense Treaty. When Korean war broke

                                assistance. (He became somewhat worked up at this point.) On problem
                                of confidence in each other he recalled that during meeting with

                                stronger, and that this was expressed in effect in joint

                                after moment’s reflection I decided to leave obvious challenge for

                                any case to inject a correction. He went on rapidly, saying that
                                time has come for Korea to develop her economy and her defense
                                self-reliance, and he fully intended that his country would stand on
                                her own feet but only thing required is our understanding that this
                                could not be done in day or two.</item>

                                for withdrawal. Korean people are keenly interested in reduction of
                                forces and disposal of our equipment and how much will be made
                                available. They are not sure of our intentions. Will there be more
                                reductions next year?</item>

                            <item>Noting his uncertainty, I suggested that he might consider having

                                    >Michaelis</persName>’s staff and consider various problems
                                arising from our force reduction and plan orderly arrangements for
                                equipment, units, etc. which are needed. I added that we understand
                                he seeking some kind of assurance but nature of what he is seeking
                                is not clear to us. It appears to lie on diplomatic side, and we
                                could explore what they have in mind while his people make practical
                                arrangements with our military officers which would not necessarily
                                imply that he had agreed to our force reductions.</item>

                                rejoined again that it was necessary only because <gloss

                                    <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> reiterated his
                                “regret and displeasure” at U.S. action and stated again he would

                                modernization talks. He said that if U.S. troops were being moved
                                elsewhere for emergency purposes then this hasty withdrawal would be
                                understandable but that is not case and it is based only on U.S.
                                domestic political problems, and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                should be given more time. So far everything is on unilateral basis
                                and U.S. is not respecting or listening to <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> wishes. U.S. troops are merely going home and
                                withdrawal is not for any emergency purpose. What about <gloss

                                security remains unchanged. We do not understand why such assurances
                                cannot be taken to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> public. Our
                                plans involve less than three per cent of main <gloss

                                generous compensatory arrangements. Also we find it difficult to
                                agree that only one side of problem, modernization, should be
                                discussed. Both modernization and troop reduction planning must go
                                forward together. Unless they do, modernization program may
                                encounter obstacles in Congress. I would leave with him informal

                        <p>KRA 3085. Today in a discussion with <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KDJ1">Jung</persName> once again reaffirmed
                            there could be no discussion of force reduction until a mutually
                            recommended requirements plan for modernization was developed and not
                            until the President had an assured package to “show to his people.”</p>
                        <p>After a rather lengthy and tense discussion, <persName corresp="#p_KDJ1"
                                >Jung</persName>, stating he was speaking to me as a private

                            when the modernization committee has evolved an agreed upon requirements
                            package and after President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                            submitted an <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71 supplemental to the
                            Congress, they would discuss the reduction of 20,000 but not the removal
                            of a division, corps headquarters and corps artillery. Asked for an
                            explanation, he said this meant a man for man and unit for unit
                            substitution. Two <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> divisions and corps
                            structure under <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> command must

                        <p>The Under Secretaries’ Committee has looked hard at the necessity for
                            modernizing Korea’s Armed Forces and has concluded that within the
                            limits of the $1.0 billion 5-year program (less the value of excess
                            equipment which might be included) modernization would be limited
                            largely to the ground forces. To provide a reasonable level of
                            modernization for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Air Force and
                            Navy the Under Secretaries’ Committee believes an additional $500

                            and improvement in Air Base facilities to permit rapid reintroduction of
                            U.S. air power and reduce vulnerability to attack. However, only $71.8

                            Force over the 5-year period was contemplated, and no investment funds

                                >ROK</gloss> Navy.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that a program of balanced force modernization with the
                            ultimate objective of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military
                            self-sufficiency over the next five years will involve a very high price
                            tag. It is equally clear that a program focused primarily towards <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> ground force modernization, while
                            considerably less expensive, will involve a continuing and more
                            immediate requirement to provide U.S. air and naval reinforcements in
                            the event of a North Korean attack.</p>
                        <p>While it is unlikely that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            Government will be able to support a militarily self-sufficient force
                            from its own resources and thus will seek continued substantial military
                            assistance from us for the indefinite future, the cost of increasing
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> naval and air capabilities would
                            be less than that required to provide equivalent U.S. force capabilities
                            in the area.</p>
                        <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0209"/>
                        <p>I believe that a modernization program for the Air Force and Navy is
                            worth our support. This program cannot be achieved within the limits of
                            the existing $1 billion program, and the $1.5 billion figure provides a
                            reasonable add-on. (We may want to take a hard look at the specifics of
                            the increases proposed for the Army, Navy and Air Force, however.)</p>
                        <p>I recommend therefore that you approve in principle a balanced force
                            modernization program with a level of $1.5 billion for the period <gloss

                            should be made. The Committee notes that additional funds also will be
                            required for both economic and military assistance for Cambodia.
                            Consideration will have to be given as to whether these requests and
                            that for Korea should be combined.</p>
                        <p>The Committee does recommend, though, that the Vice President announce
                            publicly during his visit to Seoul<note n="5" xml:id="d70fn5">See <ref

                        <p>You have indicated that you do not want to request a supplemental before
                            November. If the Vice President announces your intention to request a
                            supplemental, it may tend to force your hand with the Congress and raise
                            the question of the effect of Cambodian operations on our current <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> levels earlier than would otherwise be
                            the case.</p>
                        <p>I recommend, therefore, that the Vice President be instructed not to
                            announce or inform Korean officials that the U.S. intends to seek a
                            supplemental. You will want the Vice President to make the point in
                            general terms that we support the concept of modernization and will do
                            all that we can subject to approval of the Congress to provide a

                        <p>[Omitted here is a discussion of U.S. force levels in Europe.]</p>
                        <p>With respect to Korea, I feel that the stresses and strains surrounding
                            our decision to reduce by 20,000 this fiscal year are such that the
                            traffic would not bear another substantial withdrawal for at least the
                            next year or two. While I agree that we should work toward carrying out
                            some further reduction in our forces in Korea, I am concerned that we do
                            so in a way that does not give the wrong signal either to the other side
                            or to our friends in the area. This will take time and careful handling.
                            My concern in this regard is not only with respect to Korea, but perhaps
                            even more importantly with respect to Japan. You well know what a
                            volatile people the Japanese are. I have already noted concern <pb
                                n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0212"/>on the part of some of them
                            that we are perhaps moving too far and too fast in reducing our presence
                            in the area. While some concern on the part of the Japanese is healthy,
                            I feel that we should be careful not to cross over the line that would
                            cause the Japanese to have such doubts about our deterrent capabilities
                            and intentions with respect to Japan and the rest of the area [<hi

                                this morning and, as indicated in <gloss target="#t_Reftel1"
                                    >Reftel</gloss> and he had indicated to me yesterday, he left
                                with me a piece of paper entitled “agreed minutes,”<note n="3"

                                containing eight points, to be signed on behalf of both governments.
                                He said that he was giving me this paper for my “reference only”, as
                                it was understood all negotiations on this subject were centered
                                with you and Seoul.</item>

                            <item>In response to my questions, he said that it was envisaged that
                                the “agreed minutes” would remain a confidential document between
                                the two governments and that there would be a separate public
                                statement. He said that he did not feel that the first five points
                                should give much difficulty, as they primarily repeated what had
                                been said on various occasions in the past; but he recognized that
                                para six, which stated that the U.S. “has no intention of acting in
                                a manner contrary to the wishes of the Korean Government” with
                                respect to consultations on <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0213"
                                />future troop reductions, created problems, and that para seven,
                                establishing annual meetings of U.S. and <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> Foreign and Defense Ministers on “implementation of

                                Security Consultative Committee” chaired by the Foreign Minister and
                                including the <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss>, with the
                                Ambassador and <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss> on the
                                U.S. side, was something new.</item>

                            <item>After glancing through the paper, I said that without going into
                                details I could not accept the concept. I pointed out that vis-à-vis
                                the Congress it would be entirely impossible for us to acknowledge
                                (as we would have to do) that we had a “secret agreement” with
                                    <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> and at the same time to
                                allege that “it did not contain anything new” in the way of a U.S.
                                commitment. With respect to para six, I said that he was correct;
                                that it was entirely impossible for us to accept veto by the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> over the disposition of our
                                forces. With respect to para 7, I said that I could not accept the
                                idea of formalized annual meetings involving both the Secretary of
                                State and Secretary of Defense, but I thought it would be possible
                                to work out something a little more formalized with respect to
                                participation of high-level State officials in the annual Defense
                                Ministers’ meetings. With respect to the “Korea-U.S. Security
                                Consultative Committee” in Seoul, I thought that this was
                                substantially the way things now were working.</item>

                            <item>I said that, at the conclusion of the present phase of talks, I
                                envisaged that only formal confidential exchange between the two
                                governments would be a factual recording of the understandings that
                                had been reached with respect to what we were going to seek in the
                                way of modernization and changes in disposition of forces consequent
                                to our reduction. In reply to <persName>Kim</persName>’s question, I
                                said that I did not have any view on whether this should be an
                                exchange between you and the Foreign Minister or between <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MJH1">Michaelis</persName> and <gloss
                                    target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss>, but it seemed to me the latter
                                would be the normal and natural way of doing it. The only other
                                thing that I envisaged was relatively brief agreed public statement
                                to be issued by both governments. In response to
                                    <persName>Kim</persName>’s question I said that I did not
                                envisage this as being a signed “agreement,” but rather an agreed
                                public statement to be issued by you and the Foreign Minister in
                                Seoul, with our making copies available here; but I did not reject
                                the idea of a simultaneous Foreign Ministry and Department of State
                                statement. I said that we had been discussing such a statement with
                                you and I expected that you would shortly have the instructions to
                                enable you to discuss a text with the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1"

                                was not very spirited, and he obviously anticipated my reaction. I

                                this point is baffled, because CEMC ruling does not affect right of

                                proclaim their candidacy for presidency, but even if

                                He inquired whether in my opinion there would be problem for

                                public. Minister then said we would soon see what <gloss

                                committee on that subject had achieved agreement about items to
                                submit to higher authority for examination and approval. This
                                process now under way, and list being examined in Washington. It
                                possible there might be some changes to suggest to <gloss

                            <item>As for arrangements arising from our plans for troop reductions, I
                                understood his people well briefed on our intentions and schedule.
                                One point remaining is U.S. reaction to <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> proposal for retention of I Corps. When Washington
                                reaction to this proposal is received, whether favorable or
                                otherwise, we would consider that troop arrangement discussions were
                                effectively concluded. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>
                                inquired whether I thought reaction to their I Corps proposal would
                                be favorable. I replied I unable to say, that I had recommended
                                favorable considerations as had General <persName corresp="#p_MJH1"

                                    >See <ref target="#d74">Document 74</ref>.</note> We had made it
                                clear in Washington and Seoul that it was simply not practical to
                                proceed along lines they proposed, and that to attempt to do so
                                could have very unfortunate effect on congressional consideration of
                                programs benefiting <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, including
                                modernization. We regretted necessity for this stand, but <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SS1">Symington</persName> subcommittee hearings had
                                surely made clear to <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
                                considerable sensitivity that exists in Congress toward matters
                                connected with our commitments. We urged <gloss target="#t_ROKG1"
                                    >ROKG</gloss> to leave well enough alone. First things had to
                                come first, and by that I meant we must be free to approach Congress
                                on modernization and other programs without having to cope with
                                accusation that we were enlarging on our commitments. This was my
                                government’s view, I said, and I personally convinced that <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> insistence on anything like
                                eight-point “agreed minutes” would have very adverse effect on
                                important <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> interests. I urged him
                                both personally and officially to put these proposals aside and have
                                confidence that we knew best how to advance <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> interests. Without making any other comment,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> said quite simply
                                that he agreed. I said I appreciated his wise decision. I summed up
                                this part of conversation by saying that as I understood it, when
                                our response to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> proposal about I
                                Corps arrives, we will consider our military arrangements have been
                                concluded. I would then approach the <gloss target="#t_govt1"
                                    >govt</gloss> with draft statement for their consideration which
                                would say that we had made satisfactory progress in those matters,
                                and which, for purposes of public reassurance, would take note of
                                fact that our commitment remained unchanged. President <persName

                                <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I was surprised to some extent by

                                though we had feeling here that various factors were working on him,
                                including of course congressional factor, and pressure from

                                to arrange things their way, but were facing need for conclusion for

                                I consider that this conversation effectively phased out Foreign
                                Minister’s drive for eight-point type of document, and I will check
                                with Secretary General <persName>Kim</persName> of Blue House to
                                ensure that both <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> and

                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>) will not be held until May, 1971, the
                            candidate of the opposition New Democratic Party, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KDJ1">Kim Tae-chung</persName>, has already emerged as a
                            serious contender in the race against President <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park Chung Hee</persName>. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> is seeking a third term, the
                            Constitution having been amended last year to remove the provision which
                            limited the President to two terms in office.</p>
                        <p>In seeking re-election, <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> can
                            point to a solid record of achievement, particularly his role in the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>’s remarkable economic growth.
                            During his administration the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has
                            taken giant strides toward stability, economic viability, and
                            international acceptance. The President also enjoys the political
                            advantages accruing to the strong, authoritarian chief of a state in
                            which democratic institutions are only beginning to develop. He has a
                            large measure of control over the media, a sizeable and active party
                            organization, control of the armed forces as well as of extensive and
                            well-endowed security organs.</p>
                        <p>Conversely, a long period in power has eroded the elan noted in his
                            regime in earlier years, the corruption which he originally sought to
                            stamp out has reappeared and may even have increased, and there is
                            widespread impatience at the heavy hand of his security organs. Most of
                            the population has benefited from economic growth, but disparities in
                            income are excessive. The campaign to amend the Constitution, during
                            which he made statements à la DeGaulle, offering the electorate a choice
                            between himself and chaos, left a legacy of distrust and
                            disappointment.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> is now 53 years of age.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> is 45, and the most vigorous opponent to
                            face the President thus far. <persName>Kim</persName> is also able and
                            intelligent, an excellent orator, skilled both at haranguing large
                            crowds and establishing easy relationships with small groups of
                            intellectuals. He offers an alternative, in contrast to previous
                            candidates who could only oppose for opposition’s sake.</p>
                        <p>Since his nomination <persName>Kim</persName> has toured Korea,
                            expounding his views to large—up to 200,000—crowds in the country’s
                            major cities. He does not deny <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName>’s achievements, but declares that a change is
                            needed to straighten out the political, economic and social inequities
                            which he claims are developing in Korea. Specifically, he advocates
                            elimination of the favoritism-riddled Homeland Reserve, the restoration
                            of local self-government, the establishment of a graduated income tax,
                            lowering of the voting age, and the raising of investment in rural areas
                            by twenty percent. In foreign affairs, <persName>Kim</persName> accuses
                            the President of exaggerating the North Korean threat to prolong the
                            life of his own regime, asks for talks on reunification with <persName

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> has reportedly
                            asked Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CIK1">Chung
                                Il-kwon</persName> to “do something” about <persName>Kim</persName>,
                            and several leaders of the ruling Democratic-Republican Party (<gloss
                                target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss>) have urged the government to take
                            strong action against <persName>Kim</persName> on the basis of alleged
                            violations of the anti-communist laws (i.e. <persName>Kim</persName>’s
                            remarks bearing on Korean security). Reluctant to make
                                <persName>Kim</persName> a martyr, the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1"
                                >ROKG</gloss> has acted to squelch future publicity about
                                <persName>Kim</persName>’s speeches, and has mounted a radio and TV
                            campaign against him. The latter included a live TV-radio press
                            conference in which Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_KDJ1"
                                >Jung</persName>, supported by thirty leading Defense officials
                            including the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> chairman, denounced
                                <persName>Kim</persName>’s call for abolition of the Homeland
                            Reserve as “benefiting the enemy.”</p>
                        <p>If we have any experience with Korean elections, it is that they can be
                            hotly contested, sensitive, and even disruptive to internal stability.
                            As this one begins to take shape, it appears it will not be an

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> has agreed to a
                            suggestion from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>
                            that the Republic of Korea Government (<gloss target="#t_ROKG1"
                                >ROKG</gloss>) set aside its request for new “diplomatic assurances”
                            in regard to further reduction of U.S. forces in Korea. The <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> had earlier submitted an eight point
                            “Agreed Minutes” paper<note n="2" xml:id="d78fn2">See <ref target="#d74"
                                    >Document 74</ref>.</note> to be issued jointly by both sides
                            when our talks were completed. The most controversial point was a
                            proposed requirement for “full prior consultation” in connection with
                            future reductions, and a statement that we would take no actions
                            contrary to the wishes of the Korean Government. We had informed the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> both in Seoul and in Washington
                            that their paper was unacceptable and that we could not grant the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> such veto power over the deployment of
                            our forces. We told them, however, that we would see value for both
                            sides in a statement, either by President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> unilaterally or jointly with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>, that we had reached
                            satisfactory agreement on both the extent and manner of troop reductions
                            and on modernization. In this we would also reaffirm our treaty
                            commitment. President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> has
                            agreed to such a statement.</p>
                        <p>A draft statement is under discussion with the Department of Defense and
                            we hope to send it to the White House for clearance very shortly.</p>
                        <p>In making his decision President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> was probably motivated by the need—for both
                            domestic and diplomatic reasons—to show satisfactory results in his
                            negotiations with us. His opponent in next May’s presidential election,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KDJ1">Kim Tae-chung</persName>, has charged
                            that the President has made a mess of relations with the Americans.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> has also charged that the President has
                            deliberately fostered an atmosphere of tension and fear, fear of North
                            Korean aggression and fear of abandonment by <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198"
                                facs="0225"/>the Americans, in his efforts to prolong the life of
                            his regime. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> is very
                            sensitive to both charges. He has probably realized that there is no
                            chance that we will reconsider our positions and that further adamancy
                            on his part could cost him heavily with both our Congress and the Korean
                            electorate. Whatever the reasons for <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName>’s apparent acquiescence, the result is entirely
                            favorable.</p>

                            problem with the first two paragraphs; however, we felt that the use of
                            the word “commitment” in the third paragraph, while substantively not
                            requiring anything more of the U.S. than the language of the Mutual

                            <item>South Korea’s position on the Korean peninsula has improved
                                considerably in recent years. It has had a long period of political
                                stability. The economy is booming. Its military strength poses a
                                substantial deterrent to any North Korean invasion. And South
                                Korea’s international position is notably stronger than that of the
                                North. The planned withdrawal of one <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                    >US</gloss> Army division from South Korea will not of itself

                            <item>North Korea, probably in part responding to these changes and to
                                the evident failure of its military confrontation tactics, has
                                changed its line of attack. Terrorism and paramilitary action have
                                been deemphasized. North Korean efforts to build a base for
                                political subversion in South Korea, as well as diplomatic activity
                                abroad, both appear to be increasing. Pyongyang probably hopes by a
                                more “peaceful” approach to weaken support for the vigorously
                                anticommunist Seoul regime in world (especially American) opinion,
                                and to play on the natural desire of many South Koreans for closer
                                North-South relations.</item>

                            <item>South Korea is likely to respond to Pyongyang’s more flexible
                                tactics by some very tentative approaches of its own toward East

                                direct moves to ease tensions with North Korea still seem far

                                to maintain firm <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> security
                                commitments, to retain some <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troops
                                on its territory, and to strengthen ties with fellow non-communists

                            <item>Only South Korea itself could give the North a significant opening
                                for its political subversion efforts. Pyongyang will be alert to
                                exploit suspicions or misunderstandings between Seoul and
                                Washington—especially Seoul’s fear that the <gloss target="#t_US1"

                                less stable. In such circumstances, North Korean propaganda and
                                subversion might begin to have more impact than has been the case to
                                date, and the North might be tempted once again to reintensify
                                paramilitary action and armed subversion against the South.</item>

                        <p rend="center">Discussion</p>
                        <p>1. During most of the time since World War II, South Korea has
                            constituted a serious problem of one kind or another for <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy. Simple economic viability was
                            long a worry—recovering from the ravages of wars, establishing the basis
                            of a modern industrial society in a traditionally agricultural and
                            resource-poor land, and much of the time fighting the twin handicaps of
                            ruinous inflation and pervasive official corruption. Political life has
                            been no less troubled. The shortcomings of Syngman Rhee’s regime during
                            the 1950s led to his overthrow in 1960. Under the brief experiment with
                            free political activity which followed, the perennial factionalism of
                            Korean political life degenerated into mounting public disorder. Major
                            General <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park Chung-hee</persName> and his
                            military colleagues who seized power in 1961 put a stop to that. But
                            they were slow to win genuine popular support, even after they converted
                            themselves into a civilian government in 1963. And throughout these
                            years, South Korea has lived under the shadow of the hostile North and
                            its powerful Communist backers. In the last few years, however, changes
                            taking place throughout <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s
                            reign have culminated in a quite impressive position of strength.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">1. The Balance Sheet</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>, although
                            lacking the more flamboyant qualities of leadership, has slowly achieved
                            dominance of South Korean political life and the acceptance of his
                            countrymen by virtue of solid accomplishment. He has skillfully
                            maneuvered among rival power brokers to give South Korea a prolonged
                            period of political stability—authoritarian, to be sure, but more subtle
                            in application than during much of Korea’s modern history. He also has
                            overseen an economic development program, centered on labor-intensive
                            export industries, which has made most South Koreans better off than
                            ever before. Since 1964, South Korea’s real gross national product
                                (<gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>) has increased at the
                            remarkably high rate of 12 percent a year, while industrial production
                            has grown 19 percent and exports 41 percent annually. The South Korean
                            economic scene has drawn the high, if grudging, praise of one Japanese
                            businessman that “they are where we were 15 years ago.”</p>
                        <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0229"/>
                        <p>3. Under <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s supervision, South
                            Korea has developed one of the most competent and professional civil and
                            military government structures in Asia. Its army, the fourth largest in
                            the world, is reasonably well equipped through <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> aid programs, and its officer and non-commissioned
                            officer corps has received leadership and combat experience in Vietnam.
                            Moreover the younger officers now coming into leadership positions are
                            better trained, and seem less rent by regional and personal factionalism
                            and more imbued with professionalism, than were their predecessors. The
                            civil bureaucracy also has gained in effectiveness. A large infusion of
                            fresh blood following the military coup of 1961 has installed young men,
                            well qualified by academic training and experience or by military
                            service, in key positions.</p>
                        <p>4. Progress also has been made toward international acceptance. One of
                            the most difficult problems was resolved on at least a formal level with
                            the 1965 treaty normalizing relations with Japan. Since then, Japanese
                            capital has played a vital role in South Korea’s economic growth.
                            Suspicion and outright dislike of Korea’s sometime conqueror persist,
                            but there nevertheless is a growing recognition within the leadership in
                            both countries of common regional interests. An encouraging feature of
                            the relationship has been quiet cooperation in the exchange of
                            intelligence. Other advances toward international status have been South
                            Korea’s acceptance in regional groupings, such as the Asian and Pacific
                            Council (<gloss target="#t_ASPAC1">ASPAC</gloss>) and the Asian
                            Development Bank. Its participation as an American ally in the
                            Vietnamese war has given it a sense of pride and self-confidence which
                            may prove as important as the more tangible military and economic
                            benefits that participation has brought.</p>
                        <p>5. These very successes have created potential problems. South Korea has
                            relied heavily on foreign loan capital to finance its economic boom, and
                            in the process has accrued massive foreign debts. In normal
                            circumstances South Korea should be able to handle these debts. But it
                            is highly vulnerable to international economic conditions. A serious
                            world-wide recession, or the loss of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            markets, or anything which frightened off foreign investors, could
                            undermine the whole delicate structure of rapidly growing exports to
                            earn the money to repay the loans which make possible in the first place
                            the industrial growth to produce the exports to earn the money.</p>
                        <p>6. There also are inequities in the distribution of South Korea’s new
                            prosperity. The rural areas lag in educational opportunities, housing,
                            and health and other government services, as well as in actual income
                            levels. Even in the booming cities unskilled wages remain very low, and
                            the pressures of rapid urbanization could aggravate worker resentment at
                            the prosperity of South Korea’s growing middle class. The “revolution of
                            rising expectations” is not yet a serious political problem in South
                            Korea, but the ingredients are there.</p>
                        <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0230"/>
                        <p>7. Finally, South Korea’s political stability rests too much on <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> himself, and on a feeling of
                            threat from the North which makes <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName>’s strong rule seem acceptable. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s very success in dominating South
                            Korea’s political life has served to stunt the growth of democratic
                            institutions, or the development of independent political leaders. There
                            is no effective political opposition. The New Democratic Party (<gloss
                                target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss>), chief candidate for that role, is
                            weak and divided. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s own
                            Democratic Republican Party is allowed little role in policy making, and
                            even the implementation of policy is primarily in the hands of military
                            men, with whom <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> still
                            identifies far more than with civilian politicians. Corruption still is
                            an integral part of the governmental process, making the possibility of
                            new national scandals ever-present. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName>’s heavy-handed rigging of elections he surely would
                            win, even if they were free and fair, serves further to discredit the
                            democratic process. In sum, while <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> is careful to preserve the forms of parliamentary
                            process, including a considerable degree of free speech and a relatively
                            independent press, there is little real sharing of power or deep-felt
                            public identification with the regime.</p>
                        <p>8. Of itself, this may not matter too much. Democracy is a foreign plant
                            in South Korea, with shallow roots in the cultural traditions and
                            emotions of the people. Personal and family ties still rate higher than
                            any concept of impersonal law or broadly based political parties, and
                            Confucian paternalism runs directly contrary to ideas of shared or
                            diffused power. Stability, order, economic progress, and relative
                            freedom from government harassment mean more to all but a very few
                            Koreans than parliamentary processes, and on these counts <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> delivers handsomely.</p>
                        <p>9. But <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> (however
                            understandably) has been unwilling to designate an heir apparent, and
                            his skill in playing even his own supporters off against one another has
                            kept any individual or group from emerging as an obvious potential
                            successor. The powerful South Korean Central Intelligence Agency and the
                            Army command are suspicious, even hostile, rivals. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJP1">Kim Chong-p’il</persName>, the guiding political
                            genius of the regime’s early years, is able and aggressive and has
                            something of a personal following. But this alone makes him suspect by
                            many, and he can no longer count on <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName>’s support for the succession. When <persName

                            last year, to enable himself to run for a third term as President in
                            1971, he forfeited an early opportunity to oversee the first orderly
                            transfer of power in the Republic’s history. Should that transfer take

                            stability probably would depend on whether the change of circumstances
                            threw up another individual who could impose his will on the
                            congenitally feuding Koreans.</p>
                        <p>10. And <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s own dominance is
                            based to an unhealthy extent on the widespread sense of threat from the
                            North, which the government <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0231"/>has
                            at least in part purposely exaggerated. If this threat should recede—if
                            national unity no longer seemed quite so crucial—a wide range of
                            destabilizing tendencies could emerge. Relations with North Korea might
                            become a controversial issue. Students—traditionally regarded by
                            themselves and many others as the “conscience of the nation”—might be
                            less willing to tolerate government corruption and limits on political
                            freedoms. Trade unions might be more openly restive about government
                            control. Ambitious individuals in the political parties or the military
                            might hope to use such sentiments to challenge <persName

                        <p>11. Indeed, very tentative signs of such political stirrings already are
                            evident. <persName corresp="#p_KDJ1">Kim Tae-chung</persName>, the young

                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s tendency under stress
                            to withdraw into a distant authoritarianism, at times paralyzed by

                        <p>12. On balance, however, we think that South Korea should be able to cope
                            with its problems and maintain a relatively strong position for the next
                            few years at least. South Korea’s strengths are especially impressive
                            when measured against the apparent failings of the North. All our
                            evidence indicates that North Korea’s economy is doing badly compared
                            with the South, and its political and military apparatus has been
                            disrupted by a seemingly endless succession of high level purges.</p>
                        <p>13. The planned withdrawal of one <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            division from South Korea—about 20,000 of the presently authorized total
                            of 63,000 men—will not of itself significantly alter the relative
                            military balance between North and South. The South Korean military has
                            shown increasing skill in coping with North Korean guerrilla
                            infiltration efforts. With <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> air and
                            logistic support, South Korea should be able to successfully defend

                            for about a month. In fact, South Korea’s military position vis-à-vis
                            the North should be further strengthened by the $1.5 billion equipment
                            modernization program which the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>

                        <p>14. Nor will South Korea’s economy be markedly damaged by the planned
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troop withdrawals. <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military spending, which includes
                            Vietnam-related items as well as money brought in because of troops
                            actually in South Korea, has contributed on the average only about 15
                            percent of the real increase in South Korea’s <gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                                >GNP</gloss> during the 1965–1969 period. This share has been
                            steadily declining with the expansion of South Korea’s economy. The loss
                            of about 20,000 <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troops will at most
                            slow down South Korea’s (conservatively) estimated 10 percent annual
                            growth during the next several years to a still highly impressive 9
                            percent, and will cost Seoul roughly $50 million a year in dollar
                            earnings. This loss is relatively small when compared with South Korea’s
                            export earnings of nearly $1 billion in 1970, and its $400 million
                            annually in foreign capital inflows. It will not have much balance of
                            payments effect so long as exports continue to climb rapidly.</p>

                        <p>15. The North Koreans seem to have read the balance sheet in much this
                            way, and have revised their tactics against the South accordingly. The
                            immediate cause of this tactical adjustment seems to have been the
                            failure of their experiment with paramilitary tactics and terrorism from
                            1966 through 1968. Such large scale disasters as the Blue House raid and
                            the mass landings at Ulchin on the east coast, far from encouraging the
                            people of the South to rise in “people’s war”, only stiffened the
                            South’s resistance, while justifying the presence of <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troops in the eyes of the world. Since
                            early 1969, the rate of incidents along the Demilitarized Zone (<gloss
                                target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>) has dropped by over 80 percent.
                            Meanwhile, the emphasis of Pyongyang’s efforts has shifted to the
                            infiltration of agents for political subversion—i.e., to recruit agents,
                            organize cells, and to develop the political base for revolution in the
                            South. <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-song</persName> has recently
                            signaled the continuation of this policy by warning that the people of
                            the South must take the responsibility for their own revolution; the
                            road ahead, he said, will not be an easy one.</p>
                        <p>16. While shifting its emphasis from armed to political subversion
                            against the South, North Korea has also resumed its earlier campaign for
                            international status and influence. An extensive effort is under way,
                            particularly in Africa, to open trade and diplomatic ties. Denunciations
                            of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>’s role in the Korean Question
                            have again become somewhat more ambiguous. Attempts also have been made
                            at least to seem more flexible on relations with the South. North Korea
                            has revived earlier <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0233"/>suggestions
                            ranging from such limited steps as mail exchanges and visits between
                            members of divided families, to a non-aggression pact, mutual troop
                            reductions, and even a confederation of the two Koreas, each keeping its
                            different social and political system. Pyongyang’s constant demands
                            remain the withdrawal of all foreign (i.e., American) troops from the
                            peninsula and the ouster of the <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> government by the South Korean people.</p>
                        <p>17. All in all, North Korea seems to be showing its peaceful face at the
                            moment, both to the South and to international opinion.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> doubtless hopes to exploit the natural
                            desire of many South Koreans for better relations with the North. These
                            shifts in military and diplomatic activity are reflected in new
                            propaganda emphasis from the North. “Peaceful re-unification” is once
                            more the key phrase, with nation-wide elections possible if only (again)
                            the foreign troops would leave. While it is granted that military means
                            may eventually have to be used to achieve reunification, Pyongyang now
                            claims to foresee this as a response it will make only when the South
                            Koreans themselves rise up in revolt against their foreign oppressors
                            and the native puppet government.</p>
                        <p>18. We have very little evidence as to why this change in tactics has
                            come about, and still less about how long it might obtain. But
                            speculation about the “why” does give some indication of “how long.” For
                            a start, Pyongyang’s openly aggressive tactics were obviously not
                            working. Far from weakening the South Korean regime, the evident threat
                            was serving to solidify support for <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> and acceptance of his strong rule. Nor was North
                            Korean brinkmanship generating international pressure on the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to withdraw from Korea. Quite the
                            contrary: it demonstrated the need for continued <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> military presence in the peninsula, while both Peking
                            and Moscow were clearly reluctant to back up North Korean adventurism.
                            With Pyongyang’s two potential backers feuding between themselves, the
                            North Koreans could not count on receiving the level of support
                            necessary to further pursuit of the high-risk policy.</p>
                        <p>19. And North Korea had mounting problems at home. We already have
                            mentioned its economic failings, and the purge in late 1968 of key
                            military and intelligence leaders.<note n="4" xml:id="d80fn4">Those
                                purged in 1968 included three of North Korea’s five Army Group
                                Commanders, the Minister of Defense, the Army Chief of Staff, and
                                the Chief of the Army’s Reconnaissance Bureau. [Footnote is in the

                            because their policies toward the South had failed or whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-song</persName> got rid of them for quite
                            other reasons (most likely because he feared they were or might become a
                            threat to his total control of the military) and then used them as
                            scapegoats for an unsuccessful policy. Whatever the true reason for the
                            purge, it seems likely <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0234"/>that a
                            need to regroup and rebuild at home would further diminish
                                <persName>Kim</persName>’s enthusiasm for an aggressive policy
                            toward the South which was not working anyway.</p>
                        <p>20. <persName>Kim</persName> furthermore can reason that his newer
                            “peaceful” approach is having some success. His diplomatic offensive has
                            thus far won recognition from a few more African and Middle Eastern
                            states. More important, the Japanese have been encouraged to hope that
                            North Korea may be ripe for their “bridge building” efforts, and are
                            likely to increase economic and even political contacts. Most of all,
                                <persName>Kim</persName>’s present course is in keeping with the
                            current fashion of détente. He can hope that in the absence of a clear

                            government will weaken. Indeed, he may see the planned reduction of
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troop strength in the South as
                            consistent with his present policy, if not an actual consequence of
                            it.</p>
                        <p>21. What we cannot estimate with much confidence is
                                <persName>Kim</persName>’s own volatile personality. His desire for
                            the international limelight and his apparent tendency to act hastily and
                            emotionally when he feels his position threatened, together with a real
                            need to buck up the spirits of the North Korean populace and reconcile
                            them to continued economic and political hardships, all may make it
                            difficult for him to hold steady on a “peaceful” course. At any time he
                            thought it opportune, and with very little warning,
                                <persName>Kim</persName> could revert to a paramilitary approach
                            toward the South. But insofar as evidence and logic are useful guides in
                            such a situation, it seems to us likely that for some time to come North
                            Korea should calculate that it has little to gain from aggressive
                            military tactics on any significant scale against South Korean
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>22. Pyongyang probably will indulge in military spectaculars from time to
                            time. These might be directed at <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            targets in and around the peninsula if the opportunity arises—something
                            like the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> or <gloss target="#t_EC1211"
                                >EC–121</gloss> incidents—rather than at South Korea itself.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> would hope to erode American interest in
                            defending South Korea and to shake South Korean confidence in our
                            willingness to react sufficiently vigorously, as well as to demonstrate
                            that his quarrel is not with South Korea as such but with the “foreign
                            oppressors” whose presence prevents better North-South relations. There
                            might also be attempts at political assassination in the South. These
                            probably would be designed to appear to be the work of South Korean
                            “freedom fighters”, rather than North Korean military actions.</p>

                            possibly confusing challenge to the South. It is a competition South
                            Korea is eminently qualified to win, provided it has confidence in its
                                <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0235"/>considerable strengths
                            vis-à-vis the North. We think it increasingly has. South Korean
                            estimates of the impact of the proposed <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> troop withdrawals on the actual military balance largely
                            parallel our own. But their frequently expressed concern that North
                            Korea might miscalculate the withdrawals, as a sign of diminished <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> commitment, reflects their own fears that
                            indeed this may be just the beginning of a general disengagement policy.
                            While gaining in self-confidence, the southerners are not yet convinced
                            of the permanence of their “economic miracle.” Moreover, they still see
                            themselves confronted by an implacably hostile North Korea and
                            surrounded by three neighboring giants—the Soviet Union, China, and
                            Japan—who are unfriendly or at best un-trustworthy. And they worry about
                            the Americans who, they feel, once before withdrew troops from Korea too
                            soon.</p>

                            South Korea’s foreign policy for the foreseeable future. The South
                            Koreans feel strongly that they are and ought to be an exception to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine. Seoul will
                            continue seizing any opportunity to press for a bilateral guarantee of

                            failing that, for a regional security alliance. In the past it has tried

                            The common theme in all these regional efforts—we believe the central
                            South Korean aim—is not so much to improve cooperation with Asian
                            neighbors as to get the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> ever more
                            securely bound to South Korea’s defense.</p>
                        <p>25. The same motive is present in South Korean thinking about Vietnam.

                            the South Koreans are likely to play their strong hand quite skillfully
                            in diplomatic and economic competition with the North. They <pb n="209"
                                xml:id="pg_209" facs="0236"/>have more money for investment and for

                            relations. Seoul naturally will give first priority to strengthening
                            ties with fellow non-communists in East Asia. Taiwan, and at least for
                            the present Thailand, see Asian security problems in much the same light
                            as does South Korea. Some <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> officials
                            have even talked of offering South Korean troops to Thailand, especially
                            if it became necessary to withdraw them from South Vietnam. Such an
                            offer no doubt would be contingent on <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            bases and personnel remaining in Thailand; Seoul is not interested in
                            taking on purely Asian entanglements.</p>
                        <p>27. Relations with Japan are likely to grow especially close, if not warm
                            and friendly. Japan’s economic stake in South Korea is high and growing,
                            and with it inevitably comes some political influence. A whole network
                            of political, intelligence, economic, and military exchanges is
                            developing between the two at various levels of government and
                            commercial life which may lead to a sort of big-and-little-brother
                            relationship over the years. The South Koreans find their relationship
                            with Japan galling, but useful, and expect the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> to protect them from Japanese economic and potential
                            military aggressiveness. If the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> shield
                            were removed, the South Koreans might be confronted with a choice
                            between accepting a Japanese “protectorship” and coming to terms with
                            the North. We think they probably would choose the Japanese alternative;
                            but the process of making a decision would provoke strong emotions and
                            divisions within South Korea.</p>

                            with neutralist and even communist states. This is still very much in
                            the talking stage in Seoul, and is in large part a defensive reaction.
                            Seoul clearly is worried about <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> efforts
                            to improve relations with the Soviet Union, even alleging that this
                            restricts the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> from moving to check
                            North Korean aggressiveness. Now the West Germans, with whom Seoul has
                            believed it had psychological affinities and similar interests, seem
                            prepared to compromise on their divided-nation problem. At the same
                            time, South Korean officials talk of a need to block North Korean
                            diplomatic efforts throughout the world. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> appears responsive to the argument of some of his
                            advisors that South Korea will be “isolated” in international opinion if
                            it continues to seem so intransigent toward the communist world.</p>
                        <p>29. But South Korea’s evaluation of its own strengths and needs also
                            appears to be slowly changing. Seoul’s protests about Japan’s economic
                            and other dealings with the North have an increasingly formal sound, as
                            though South Koreans—while still not liking Japanese-North <pb n="210"
                                xml:id="pg_210" facs="0237"/>Korean exchanges—no longer see them as
                            such a serious threat to their own interests. Superficially at least,
                            Korean developments might follow the German model (albeit a decade or so
                            behind) of both sides working for a lessening of tensions and specific
                            improvements in relations while reunification remains impossible. But so
                            long as <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-song</persName> is in power
                            in the North, and the Korean War generation in the South, a fundamental
                            hostility to and fear of North Korea will persist. A crucial difference
                            from the German situation is that the South Koreans have been through a
                            bitter war with the North and still feel physically threatened.</p>
                        <p>30. The South Korean version of détente is therefore likely to remain a
                            matter of very small steps, far behind those of most other non-communist
                            states. Diplomatic relations may be established with countries which
                            also recognize Pyongyang. Sporting and cultural delegations will be
                            exchanged with East European states. And South Korea’s stringent
                            anticommunist law may be amended to permit trade with some communist
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>31. Progress in this direction will be very slow indeed. Seoul will have
                            trouble finding suitable goods to trade with communist states, and
                            reconciling the traditional communist preference for barter trade and
                            long-term deferred payments with its own desire for immediate foreign
                            exchange profits. It certainly will not want to seem to lessen whatever
                            obstacles other nations still feel to dealing with North Korea.
                            Furthermore, it will want to be very careful about undermining the solid
                            anticommunist front of the South Korean populace.</p>

                            difficult problem than approaches to other communist states. On 15
                            August—the 25th aniversary of Korea’s liberation from Japanese
                                rule—<persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s surprise
                            reunification proposal brought at least some propaganda advantage. He
                            departed from previous official statements dismissing unification as a
                            problem for the distant future. Instead, he challenged the North Koreans
                            to help lay the groundwork by ceasing military provocations and publicly
                            renouncing the forceful overthrow of the South Korean Government. The
                            proposal, however, was hedged about with conditions clearly unacceptable
                            to Pyongyang, which promptly denounced it. Thus, its main value probably
                            lay in its impact on world and domestic opinion, with an eye toward both
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> vote on the Korean Question and
                            the upcoming Presidential election in South Korea.</p>
                        <p>33. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s formal airing of the
                            subject did have one unavoidable side-effect—reunification will be
                            discussed with increasing openness in the South. In an effort to control
                            the pace of the blossoming debate, and to assert government control over
                            it, spokesmen have described plans to allow discussion of North-South
                            relations by stages: first among “experts”, <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211"
                                facs="0238"/>then scholars, then journalists, then students, ending
                            with general public debate in 1972. Such control will not be entirely
                            possible, particularly in the later stages. The government’s own
                            statements and actions will make it more difficult to accuse others of
                            having violated the anti-communist law by merely discussing relations
                            with the North.</p>
                        <p>34. If North Korean military activity remains at a low level, there is
                            likely to be some increase of public pressure for more initiatives
                            toward the North. Even very modest steps, e.g., family visits or mail
                            exchanges, would imply a tacit recognition of the North quite dramatic
                            in South Korean eyes. But there will be at least as many important South
                            Koreans uneasy about the whole venture as there are pressing for greater
                            flexibility. We expect Seoul’s détente efforts to continue to be a
                            matter of one step back for every two forward. And the issue of <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troops on the peninsula will remain of
                            crucial importance to both North and South, effectively limiting
                            progress toward major rapprochement between them for a long time to
                            come.</p>
                        <p>35. Even Seoul’s desire to make more friends among more kinds of states
                            must be seen in context of the priority it gives to relations with the
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. Certainly South Korea would like
                            as many nations as possible in its corner if the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> protectorship were ever weakened or removed. But there
                            really is no palatable alternative to that protection. Hence any
                            gestures Seoul makes toward North Korea will be as much an attempt to
                            demonstrate to Washington that it is not the South Koreans who are
                            responsible for continuing tensions on the peninsula, as to prepare for
                            a possible American withdrawal.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">IV. Sources of Instability</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>36. South Koreans suspect that while Washington may still consider their
                            defense a necessary burden, it is one for which American enthusiasm is
                            diminishing. They further worry that the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> might want to share its Korean load with—perhaps even
                            turn it over to—Korea’s traditional enemies, the Japanese. Their
                            suspicions about <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> constancy should ease
                            as Seoul gains confidence in its own strengths vis-à-vis the North. For
                            a very long time to come, however, there will be ample opportunity for
                            misunderstanding. A compromise settlement in South Vietnam, further
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> trooop withdrawals from South
                            Korea or Japan, efforts to improve <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>-Chinese relations (including what might be seen as <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> weakness in opposing Peking’s entry into
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>), all would arouse South Korean
                            apprehensions that Washington’s dedication to the anticommunist cause in
                            Asia was weakening.</p>
                        <p>37. There is very little the South Koreans could do about any of these
                            developments. We cannot rule out a South Korean military provocation in
                            the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, designed to show Washington
                            that American troops still were needed in Korea. Moreover, some in Seoul
                            may genuinely believe that they have much more leverage with Washington
                            than is the case. If <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0239"/>President
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>, who has staked
                            everything on the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> tie, feels
                            “abandoned” and exposed, it might aggravate his tendency to become more
                            authoritarian in his rule and less accessible to the reasoned advice of
                            subordinates in times of stress. Public pronouncements as to what the
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> “must” or “must not” do can expose
                            him to embarrassment before his own populace, and exacerbate tensions
                            between the two governments. Any break in harmonious <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            relations—e.g., intemperate statements by <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> which alienated segments of American public
                            opinion—would aid North Korean efforts to sow distrust and discord.</p>
                        <p>38. A more serious source of potential instability is the political
                            situation in South Korea itself. Should the sense of threat from the
                            North recede, the main justification for the repression of political
                            life in South Korea would no longer appear acceptable to important
                            elements in the population. We do not know what would happen in such a
                            situation, but it could lead to confusion and struggle and some
                            unraveling of political stability. In such circumstances, North Korean
                            propaganda and subversion might begin to have more impact than has been
                            the case to date, and the North might be tempted once again to
                            reintensify paramilitary action and armed subversion against the
                            South.</p>
                        <p>39. In sum, the dimension of the threat to South Korea is expanding
                            beyond the military confrontation we are used to thinking of, into a
                            more complex political competition at home and abroad. South Korea
                            clearly has the advantage on the international front. But friction
                            between South Korea and the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, or
                            between the South Korean Government and its own people, could give North
                            Korea an opening for more successful political or even paramilitary
                            action in the South than has heretofore been the case.</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> warmly welcomed Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName>, recalling their relationship while Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> was at Harvard. Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName>, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> noted, had been the only student he had ever
                            had who had been accompanied by a bodyguard. (Assemblyman Chung Joo Yoon
                            interjected to note that he, in fact, had been the one who had
                            accompanied Mr. <persName>Kim</persName>.) Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> recalled, too, that he and
                            Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> had been in Saigon at the same time on one
                            occasion. Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> responded to the effect that he
                            had hoped Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> might
                            have been able to proceed to Seoul from Saigon. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> expressed in turn the hope
                            that he could go to Seoul in the not too distant future, to which Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> responded “the sooner the better.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> stated that he would like to take this
                            opportunity to ask Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            a number of frank questions—questions which were also in President
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park Chong Hee</persName>’s mind. First,
                            could Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> visualize in
                            the foreseeable future any withdrawal of Korean troops from Vietnam, and
                            if so, when, in what form, and what size? Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> declared that in principle he
                            could see the possibility of a Korean withdrawal, for example in the
                            case of a peace settlement. He could also imagine that if the South
                            Vietnamese became strong enough to take over, then at some point the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops could be reduced. He had
                            no schedule in mind, except in the event that a peace settlement
                            materialized, and was exercising no pressure. The question of <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troop withdrawals was one that should
                            be discussed confidentially between the two Governments.</p>
                        <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0241"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if he could
                            ask Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> a question—were the Koreans satisfied
                            with the discussions they were having with our Ambassador in Seoul? Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> replied that he was personally satisfied
                            over the outcome of the negotiations with the U.S. Ambassador. He had
                            met President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> before his
                            departure, and President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> had
                            not shown any unsatisfactory reactions. However, many Koreans had not
                            had satisfactory feelings about the negotiations. On this, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> remarked that if Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName>’s President wanted to deal directly with
                            our President on issues of extreme sensitivity such as the troops in
                            Vietnam, President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> could
                            always get in touch with him, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>, through the Korean Ambassador here or through
                            someone else the Koreans could trust. Mr. <persName>Kim</persName>
                            promised after his return to tell this to President <persName

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> went on to say that to be frank, with
                            respect to the reduction of U.S. forces in Korea President <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> had expressed displeasure when
                            this announcement was first made because at the time of the San
                            Francisco conference between the two Presidents there had been no
                            mention of U.S. force reductions. Then, a sudden unilateral announcement
                            concerning reductions had occurred. From the standpoint of the staff who
                            assist President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> in
                            preparing for discussions, there should be as much advance notice as
                            possible so that they would be better able to help him out. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied that what
                            Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> had said was true; however, at the time the
                            two Presidents had met we had not known of the decision on the U.S.
                            force reduction. It was not that we had tried to keep this matter from
                            President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>. Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> indicated that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> now understood the difficult
                            decisions which the U.S. had to make. Of course, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> had to deal with next year’s
                            election, and the U.S. announcement had initially put the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government in an embarrassing position,
                            though the people now understood.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> how President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> would do next year—Mr. <persName>Kim</persName>’s
                            party had some experience in managing elections, hadn’t it? Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> acknowledged that he and his party did have
                            some experience in this field, and might need to try managing the
                            elections again. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            humorously remarked that Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> must have learned
                            some of this from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>’s
                            teachings, although the Koreans had a talent of their own.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> said that in view of changing international
                            trends over the next four or five years, Korea might find itself in a
                            more difficult position in coping with these changes and was looking
                            over its policy decisions. For this reason he wanted to ask Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>’s counsel. Among
                            the changes foreseen by the Koreans were China gaining a position in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, a continuation of the Chinese
                            Communist threat, and <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0242"/>a
                            settlement in Vietnam. In its international position Korea had to face
                            such changes. Its international security situation was a big issue, and
                            under the changed circumstances the Koreans might need to explore new
                            policy directions. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            responded by asking in what way, and towards whom? Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> then spoke of an increased degree of
                            flexibility on the international scene and an opening of doors, e.g.
                            Chinese admission to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and a
                            possible settlement in Vietnam. However, while some doors were opening
                            more widely, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> position might
                            become closed in so that it might some day be compelled to act against
                            its will. Accordingly, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> had to
                            ride over the changes and the waves on the international scene.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asserted that he
                            understood Mr. <persName>Kim</persName>’s point. We would try to consult
                            with the Koreans better than had been the case on the troop withdrawal
                            issue. Our President was not known for letting down his friends. Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> noted on the score of U.S. troop reductions
                            that after 25 years of working together the Korean people might have
                            gotten the feeling of being left in a vacuum. Still, they now understood
                            the idea and accepted it. A more fundamental point, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> declared, was that the
                            Koreans didn’t want their country to be in an isolated condition with
                            respect to the rest of Asia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> agreed that the Koreans were concerned about
                            being isolated from Asian society. The Chinese position was one of
                            flexibility, with more and more recognition and the possibility of
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> entry; on the other hand, Korea
                            was unable to have such flexibility because of basic positions which it
                            had originally taken. Thus, if the world tide was changing and Korea
                            remained as before, Korea needed to ask how it would be affected. Should
                            it continue to maintain its basic positions? This is what he, Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName>, had in mind in asking for Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>’s views.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed that we were,
                            in fact, in a transitional period. We had no illusions about China,
                            which we knew was our enemy. However, we had two enemies, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and China, which happened to be
                            fighting with one another. Speaking quite frankly, we therefore were
                            trying to see if we could use one enemy against the other. While we
                            realized that China was not our friend, the tactical situation required
                            us to see how we might use China in moves vis-à-vis the Soviets. In
                            this, though, it was out of the question that we would sacrifice Korea
                            to China. The Koreans were fortunate in not having the problem of how to
                            deal with two enemy countries. We would not abandon Korea, which should
                            not confuse our tactics with our strategy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> referred again to the U.S. force reductions
                            in Korea, observing that everyone in Korea understood that this meant a
                            detachment of the U.S. commitment to support Korea and in effect the <pb
                                n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0243"/>reestablishment of an Asian
                            defense system. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            responded by remarking that we had always thought the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> would be better off by having its army
                            modernized than by having U.S. forces present in Korea. Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName>’s reply was that Korea had the problem of
                            the North Korean threat, and needed to maintain big forces at all times.
                            As President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> had said in his
                            August 15 speech on reunification, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> was watching the negotiations between East and West
                            Germany and might need to face up to the desirability of talking with
                            North Korea. During the next four or five years, Korea would have to
                            deal with problems such as these.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> declared that we
                            were friends of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, and would do
                            what we could to support and strengthen it. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> noted that he had the highest
                            regard for President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>, and
                            had high personal regard for Mr. <persName>Kim</persName>. Mr.
                                <persName>Kim</persName> wondered if Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> had any words in mind for President <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>, and Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> reiterated that if President
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> wanted to be in direct
                            touch with us he should send the Korean Ambassador or someone else whom
                            he could trust to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>.
                            In this way we could maintain direct contact.</p>

                            appreciated the Vice President’s visit to Korea, wished he could have
                            stayed longer and hoped he would come again.<note n="3" xml:id="d82fn3"
                                >See <ref target="#d71fn2">footnote 2, Document 71</ref>.</note> The
                            Vice President said he regretted that his visit to Korea was so short,
                            but was pleased to have had the chance to travel around the country even
                            briefly. The Vice President had been greatly impressed by the
                            professionalism and high morale exhibited by the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> Army unit he had visited. He had also been impressed by
                            the film President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> had shown
                            him on North Korean war preparations and wished that other Americans
                            might have an opportunity to see such films, which put communist
                            activities into proper perspective.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said he was pleased with the talks on modernization of
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Armed Forces. He felt certain
                            that good progress would be made in these talks, but as he had told
                            President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>, the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> cannot go beyond the provisions of our
                            1954 treaty. Our treaty with Korea is worded much the same as all our
                            other treaties, so it would be inappropriate, and in fact impossible, to
                            try to alter the provisions of one treaty without creating difficulties
                            with our other treaties. Moreover, Americans consider the wording of our
                            treaties significant and binding—not only as regards limitations, but
                            also as regards positive commitments.</p>
                        <p>Aside from our firm treaty commitments, the Koreans should also consider
                            the $150 million which the President had earmarked for the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> in his supplemental aid request to
                            Congress as further evidence of our continuing support. Although we will
                            certainly have additional problems with antiwar elements, the President
                            has made it clear to the Congressional leadership that he regards all
                            our commitments as being equally important—those in Europe, the Middle
                            East and the Far East. Therefore, he regards the supplemental aid
                            request as an indivisible package which cannot be sliced apart by
                            special interest groups. For example, he has indicated he will not
                            accept an appropriation of funds for Israel—a course of action which
                            might have a certain political attraction in some quarters.</p>

                        <p>There was only one outstanding problem in <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations which
                            deeply concerned the Vice President, because it might be used by the
                            neo-isolationist forces in the Senate to undermine our supplemental aid
                            request for Korea. That problem concerned continuing Korean fishing for
                            Pacific salmon. As the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government
                            has been informed many times before, Pacific salmon are regarded by us
                            as a resource of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Canada,
                            maintained and nurtured at great expense to the taxpayers of those two
                            countries. The Vice President was worried because representatives of our
                            fishing industry had approached doves in the Senate concerning Korean
                            actions, and their complaints might affect passage of the
                            supplemental.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KDJ2">Kim</persName> launched into a
                            long explanation of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> actions
                            regarding the salmon problem. He noted that Senator Stevens and
                            representatives of State had discussed the problem with the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> last year and the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> had agreed not to catch salmon. In
                            accordance with that agreement the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            had issued no licenses for salmon this year, but some fishermen had
                            nevertheless illegally poached salmon. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> had attempted to stop these violators, but Senator
                            Stevens had become very upset and caused State to initially refuse to
                            enter into fishing discussions this year with Korea. However, Ambassador
                            McKernan had recently been in Seoul, and State now seemed to be
                            satisfied with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> explanation of
                            the problem.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President replied that our information was that a considerable
                            amount of fishing is going on despite the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> efforts to stop it. After so many discussions, even an
                            isolated incident could be used by opponents of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> cooperation. The
                            Vice President hoped that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> would
                            again look into this serious problem.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CKH1">Foreign Minister Choe</persName> then
                            addressed himself to several points which had come up in the preceding
                            conversation. He said he would pass on the Vice President’s comments
                            about the film President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> had
                            shown him and would attempt to get a copy of the film for the Vice
                            President’s retention. Regarding modernization of <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces, the Foreign Minister was
                            pleased that the House had approved our supplemental request and hoped
                            the Senate would follow suit. The Foreign Minister said he was aware
                            that Vice President <persName corresp="#p_AST1">Agnew</persName>, as
                            President of the Senate, could be of great assistance in this regard.
                            The Vice President interjected that, although one cannot rely on much in
                            Washington, one thing is absolutely certain—the President of the Senate
                            has little influence on the actions of that august body. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKH1">Choe</persName> insisted that the Vice President
                            was being unduly modest. For instance, the Vice President’s trip to
                            Korea had been most helpful, and force modernization talks were now
                            going very well.</p>
                        <p>Continuing his summation, <persName corresp="#p_CKH1">Choe</persName>
                            said that he, too, was astounded that Korean fishing boats were still
                            entering our waters for salmon. He <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219"
                                facs="0246"/>felt that Ambassador McKernan had highlighted this
                            problem, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>’s
                            démarche to President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> had
                            also underscored America’s deep concern. The President had promised
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> to do
                            everything in his power to prevent the illegal fishing from continuing.
                            Thus the Foreign Minister believed that the fishing problem would be
                            resolved to our satisfaction in the very near future. Meanwhile, the
                            Korean fishing industry was in need of better facilities and the Foreign
                            Minister noted with pleasure that Ambassador McKernan had agreed in
                            principle last year that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> might
                            help out. The Vice President simply noted that we would be glad to
                            discuss such matters, because we wish to be helpful to our good Korean
                            allies in as many ways as possible.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President asked if there had been any reduction in the number of
                            provocative incidents generated by North Korea. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKH1">Choe</persName> said the North Korean approach had
                            assumed a different character of late. The <gloss target="#t_DMZ1"
                                >DMZ</gloss> was well defended now, so the enemy was coming around
                            by sea in high speed boats, most of which were provided by the Soviets.
                            The problem was therefore more difficult due to the many small islands
                            off the South Korean coast which had to be defended. Still the North
                            Koreans had no chance of seriously disturbing the situation in South
                            Korea, and in fact, there was now some good news for the South Koreans.
                            The Foreign Minister had noted in news reports that a North Korean major
                            had defected yesterday in his Mig–15. This was the first good break for
                            the South Koreans after a long series of unfortunate incidents: the <hi
                                rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> capture, the <gloss target="#t_EC1211"
                                >EC–121</gloss> shoot down, the hijacking of a commercial airliner
                            (whose crew was still being held) and the kidnapping of the crew of a
                            South Korean loudspeaker boat.</p>
                        <p>In closing the Foreign Minister said he was very pleased with the sincere
                            spirit of cooperation which he had found among <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> officials.<note n="4" xml:id="d82fn4">In telegram 198600

                            our two countries could not jointly handle together. The Vice President
                            heartily agreed. The one thing which the Vice President admired most
                            about the Koreans was their forthright way of discussing problems. We
                            Americans understand and appreciate the direct approach. We believe it
                            is the most efficient and effective way for friends to resolve their
                            differences. At the Vice President’s request the Foreign Minister
                            promised to convey his regards to President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"

                                    attractive, active, forty-five year old politician, a Roman
                                    Catholic, and does not speak English. He is described by U.S.
                                    officials who have dealt with him as more forthcoming and direct
                                    than most Korean politicians, a proven vote getter with a
                                    persuasive manner and an eloquent, oratorical style.

                                        <persName>Kim</persName>’s opening campaign speeches, his
                                    prospects for victory next May appear at this time to be
                                    marginal at best. In comparison to President <persName

                                    organized and short of money. Moreover, <persName>Kim</persName>
                                    cannot count on even the unswerving support of all of his own
                                    party.</item>
                                <item>—The issue of U.S. troop reductions in Korea appears likely to
                                    have only a marginal impact on the election. President <persName

                                    charge that he created undue strains in relations with the
                                    Americans by his initial strong stand that any cut-back of U.S.
                                    troops in Korea at this time would be tantamount to inviting
                                    Pyongyang to resume open hostilities. The emotional impact of
                                    this issue has by now largely dissipated, however, and the talks
                                    on modernizing South Korean forces have helped to recreate an
                                    atmosphere of mutual cooperation.</item>

                                <item>—<persName>Kim</persName> cannot make too much of an issue of
                                    U.S. troop reductions without the risk of offending the nation’s
                                    625,000-man military establishment. For <persName>Kim</persName>
                                    to insist that these reductions endanger the nation’s security
                                    would, at the very least, imply criticism of the country’s armed
                                    forces, and could expose him to charges of giving aid and

                            It is rumored that <persName corresp="#p_KJP1">Kim Chong-p’il</persName>
                            was offered the Democratic Republican Party (<gloss target="#t_DRP1"

                                <persName corresp="#p_PTJ1">Paek</persName> has been in and out of
                            the government since 1945, serving under Syngman Rhee as Finance

                        <p>It is not clear why <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> chose to

                                <persName>Chong</persName>’s alleged mistress was murdered earlier
                            this year, and <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> may have seen
                            him as a liability; however, <persName corresp="#p_PTJ1">Paek</persName>
                            has been linked with various financial scandals over the years and seems
                            to be little improvement. In any case as a northerner and proportional

                                his recital of <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> fears that

                                important people in United States. He said that there are many
                                rumors in Seoul that Americans were paying for <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KDJ1">Kim Tae Chung</persName>’s trip and were
                                pledging to support him. He reached peak of this remarkable
                                statement by urging me to issue public statement to effect that U.S.
                                is absolutely neutral in matter of <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> elections “despite rumors that we are supporting
                                opposition.” I tried to deal lightly with his fears but he would not
                                change subject. I urged him to get a briefing on my statement to

                                request for “statement of neutrality” in response to rumors, I
                                commented that would not be practical measure, because anyone could
                                start new rumors that presumably would require another statement,

                            out strongly against further U.S. troop withdrawals from Korea for the
                            next two years. According to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1"
                                >Porter</persName>, it might be possible to start discussing further
                            withdrawals in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 73 and to carry them
                            out in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 74; General <persName
                                corresp="#p_SKW1">Smith</persName> argued for discussions in <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 74 and withdrawals in <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 75. The basis for objections against
                            withdrawals now was the adverse political repercussions on the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s. In addition, General <persName
                                corresp="#p_SKW1">Smith</persName> felt that the modernization
                            program had to begin to show results before our next moves if the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s were to accept those moves at all.
                            Both the Ambassador and General <persName corresp="#p_SKW1"
                                >Smith</persName> believed that we have something of a moral
                            obligation not to carry out any further force reductions for a period of
                            time sufficient to let things settle down politically in Korea, and to
                            allow the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s to adjust to the concept
                            that ground forces in Korea would for the most part be theirs.
                            Interestingly, the Ambassador and the military joined in suggesting that
                            we might ultimately be able to support our commitment in Korea through
                            air and naval forces, with only enough U.S. ground forces on hand to

                        <p>General Yoon, a senior Blue House adviser, made a special point of
                            emphasizing the adverse political repercussions which would occur in
                            Korea if we did not allow our force levels to stabilize for a reasonable
                            period of time. President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s
                            political position now would be very seriously affected if there were
                            any further drawdowns, and there might also be some increase in the
                            North Korean threat. General Yoon said that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>s were perfectly willing to assume the burden of their
                            own defense, but that modernization of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces was a prerequisite and that U.S. reductions in
                            advance of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> modernization would
                            tempt the North Koreans to attack at a time when the military balance
                            would appear most favorable. Interestingly, General Yoon appeared to
                            think that a two-year period of maintaining U.S. present force levels
                            would be acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s. General
                            Yoon also referred to the standard <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            line on U.S. withdrawals: a premature withdrawal would shake the
                            confidence of the Korean people and adversely affect the rapid <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> rate of economic growth.</p>

                        <p>In my conversations with Embassy officers and our military
                            representatives in Seoul, I was able to get the word across that there
                            was no compelling interest in the White House in getting the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops out of Vietnam. According to the
                            Ambassador, President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> felt
                            that for political reasons he had to follow the example of the other

                            from Vietnam, but would probably stop with the removal of the <gloss

                            two divisions indefinitely in Vietnam. To carry out further withdrawals
                            would mean that the provisions of the <persName corresp="#p_BWG1"

                            obliged to take over all of these costs forthwith. (They are evidently
                            willing to take over the transfer costs gradually, however; see below.)
                            General <persName corresp="#p_SKW1">Smith</persName> indicated that
                            there is no pressure from our military in Korea for the return of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops in Vietnam. They are
                            assuming that this is entirely a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            matter and not one of ours. As to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> troops in Vietnam, Lt. Gen. Knowles said to me during
                            the flight to Seoul that he would recommend getting the two <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions out of the coastal areas of
                            Vietnam and putting them into areas where they would be more useful. I
                            assume from this that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> is not
                            pushing for a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> withdrawal. However, I
                            understand that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR1">Laird</persName>
                            wants to cut back on the funds now being provided to support the <gloss

                        <p>Our military in Seoul had just finished preparing a suggested <gloss

                            forwarded to Washington via <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>.
                            The representative from State who accompanied me (Leslie Brown of the
                            Bureau of Political Military Affairs) had evidently received an advance
                            copy of this package and raised questions concerning each of the
                            recommendations for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> services. On
                            the <hi rend="italic">Army</hi> package, <persName corresp="#p_BWG1"
                                >Brown</persName> questioned the provision of self-propelled
                            artillery on the grounds that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s
                            would have difficulty maintaining this equipment and because the large
                                <gloss target="#t_OM1">O &amp; M</gloss> costs which would be
                            required. The <gloss target="#t_KMAG1">KMAG</gloss> Chief, General
                            Pezdirtz, explained that the U.S. Army does not now operate artillery
                            which is non-self-propelled, and thus the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>s would be receiving what our forces would be leaving
                            behind. In addition, he argued strongly for building up a more mobile
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> posture by developing lateral
                            roads south of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, leaving only a
                            constabulary-type screening force along the line, and drawing back the
                            main <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces to central positions
                            farther back from the line from which mobile forces could move quickly
                            to areas of North Korean attack. In this way it would be possible to
                            reduce the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces by at least
                            100,000 men, thereby offsetting the <gloss target="#t_OM1">O &amp;
                                M</gloss> costs.</p>
                        <p>On the <hi rend="italic">Air Force</hi> package, General <persName

                            argument was that with 77 F–5E’s (a type of aircraft capable of reaching
                            Pyongyang from South Korea), plus 18 <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            F–4s already on hand, plus 54 <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> F–4s
                            which will now be stationed permanently in South Korea, there will be
                            149 high-performance aircraft in the South; this would roughly balance
                            off against 108 MIG 21s and 70 IL 28s in the North—the only aircraft in

                            addition, 245 hardened shelters now exist in the South for both U.S. and
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> aircraft. The equation is that
                            the North Koreans, to strike successfully (with a 75% chance of success)
                            against the South, would need three and a half aircraft per hardened
                            shelter in order to guarantee enough destruction of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            inventory to preclude retaliation, but the North Koreans simply do not
                            possess this number of aircraft. (All hardened shelters would have to be
                            attacked since the <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0260"/>North
                            Koreans would not know which ones were occupied.) Clearly, enough U.S.
                            and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> aircraft would survive an attack
                            to be able to retaliate against Pyongyang. In these terms, the air
                            strength available in the South would constitute an effective deterrent.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_SKW1">Smith</persName>’s presentation
                            impressed me as making a great deal of sense.</p>
                        <p>On the <hi rend="italic">Navy</hi> side, the plan is to provide the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s with a substantial number of
                            fast patrol boats to cover the coastlines in the east, west and south.
                            These patrol craft would work together with three destroyers to be
                            provided which would be stationed off each of the three coasts as radar
                            picket vessels, and which could remain at sea for long periods of time.
                            The destroyers would be armed with Sea Sparrow missiles in addition to
                            guns, so that they could defend themselves against air or sea attack if
                            necessary. There was a difference of opinion within 8th Army
                            headquarters over the destroyers—General <persName corresp="#p_SKW1"
                                >Smith</persName> thought that the Sea Sparrow missile was a bad
                            idea, since the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> could shoot it at
                            anything they saw on their radar screens, and might raise problems for
                            us in this respect. There is also a question about the cost of the
                            destroyers: $26 million each seemed rather high, and would represent a
                            substantial percentage of the total <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            package. Alternatives might well be considered.</p>

                        <p>At one stage in the briefings given by 8th Army, a briefer said flatly

                            took place on March 4, a day late. Bad weather forced a postponement.
                            The drop itself, however, came off very well, with 11 C–141s dropping
                            about 700 members of the 82nd Airborne Division—a “brigade minus” as the
                            briefers on the site euphemistically put it. There were also some 300
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> paratroopers dropped. Quite an
                            array of dignitaries from Seoul came down for the affair, including
                            President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>, members of the

                        <p>Despite the good show which the paratroopers and U.S. and <gloss

                            Koreans in particular. The press coverage of the operation was very good
                            in general, but there was a constant note running through it to the
                            effect that this show was all very well, but <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234"

                            from the continental U.S. in case of dire need. The corollary was: would
                            these U.S. troops be sufficient? Throughout, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"

                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>, although one
                            of his aides made a point of taking me over to introduce me to the

                                <persName>Kim</persName> was promising more attention to the
                            economic development of the two Cholla provinces (economically backward

                                <persName>Kim</persName> had also been speaking in terms of trying
                            to open up some contacts with North Korea, thus preempting this issue
                            from under <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s nose. It
                            appeared that <persName>Kim</persName> was a more charismatic type
                            before the Korean people than <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName>, who was finding himself at a disadvantage in

                                >Park</persName> would still come out on top, but by a much closer

                                >Park</persName> had hoped for a bigger margin than last time, when

                            going to get anywhere near that much. This in itself would be a loss of

                            on charges of having violated the electoral law by opening the

                        <p>According to our military in Seoul, the younger generation of Koreans
                            coming along had been thoroughly brainwashed about the iniquities of
                            North Korea, and wanted no part of reunification (except, of course, on
                                <persName>Park Chong Hoa</persName>’s terms). This is simply not so,
                            according to a member of <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s
                            personal staff, Dr. Hahn, who is a graduate of Harvard and Yale law
                            schools. Dr. Hahn said that the theme of reunification is an extremely
                            popular one among the student generation, and <pb n="235"
                                xml:id="pg_235" facs="0262"/>that <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> is in fact missing the point by not devoting more
                            attention to this issue. According to Dr. Hahn, the younger generation
                            is quite romantic about the theme of “one Korea,” does not recall to any
                            great extent the circumstances of the Korean war, and is willing to have
                            re-unification even under North Korean control if this will bring about
                            a new national unity. The line seems to be that, “yes, we may suffer
                            hardships as a result, but this will only last for three generations or
                            so.” Dr. Hahn said that he was doing what he could to get President
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> to say something about
                            reunification. However, as noted, <persName corresp="#p_KDJ1">Kim Tae
                                Chung</persName> had already taken up a position on this issue which

                            finding it impossible as a result to adopt a stand until after the

                            being welcomed up to a point, but the Koreans were reluctant to let the

                            under Japanese majority control. This was another reason why the
                            continued U.S. presence in Korea was desired—so long as we are there in
                            force, we tend to offset the growth of Japanese influence to a level

                                >Porter</persName> convinced me that he is an extremely good
                            representative. He knew all of the Korean leaders intimately, including
                            their foibles and strong points, and was able to sort out the Korean
                            political scene in a way which made a great deal of sense. He runs a
                            taut ship in his Embassy, and is on the best of terms with the military.
                            He is also an ambassador who keeps firmly in mind <pb n="236"

                            which he is assigned, rather than the reverse. I have no doubt that this
                            has caused some strain with his relations with <persName

                            is called for. As the Ambassador said, “You gotta be able to listen to
                            ‘em cry.” I am sure that the Koreans regard him basically as being
                            sympathetic, and that they respect him for doing his job.</p>

                            the information, but I might, parenthetically, ask: what do we get for
                            the one and a half billion that we’ve committed to, in terms of military
                            preparedness of, of Korea? What if Korea—</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CJB1">Connally</persName>: Every time I ask, every
                            time we start talking about economic matters, everybody wants to keep
                            the trade off in the economic field. When we talk about military
                            matters, they’ve got nothing to give us in the military field. What do
                            we get for it?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Johnson</persName>: Two—two things. We got, we got
                            modernization of their forces—</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CJB1">Connally</persName>: What does that—?</p>

                            <persName>Johnson</persName>: —which they needed, which they needed, and
                            which was justified on its own merits. It was needed on its own merits.
                            And secondly, we got the reduction of our, our—</p>

                            <persName>Johnson</persName>: —our forces; the 20,000 forces that we

                            we will have to have Korea’s consent to reduce our forces, you know.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CJB1">Connally</persName>: Now, if it’s in our
                            interest, that’s fine. But we don’t have to have their unilateral
                            consent.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: I—I think, I think
                                <persName>John</persName> has got a point here. Let me say,
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alex</persName>, that I do not go as far
                            as some, and that I know, I know the diplomats have to take a different
                            view, and you must argue it, always. But, believe me that it
                            doesn’t—when it comes to linking, I’ll obey the linking. Military
                            linkage, economic linkage, I’m for it, if it serves our overall
                            interests. That’s really what’s it’s about—</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJB1">Connally</persName>: That’s all I’m saying,
                            Mr. President.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: Don’t compartmentalize it
                            too much.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Johnson</persName>: [unclear]</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: I think it’s very
                            important, very important to try to get—if you can work it out on an
                            economic basis, fine. But the, the [unclear] a little bit of
                            linkage—what’s that?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJB1">Connally</persName>: May I suggest, Mr.
                            President, that we ask Pete—that you ask Pete to do one other thing if
                            it appears worth [doing]. Let’s see what [unclear] might lead to
                            withdrawal. We approach this again from the standpoint of, “What can we
                            give ‘em? What more can we give ‘em?” Let’s see what they already have
                            that we can withdraw. Hong Kong? What, what can Hong Kong do for us,
                            except send us textiles? Now, how important is this if we just maintain
                            a, a great relationship with Hong Kong. Taiwan, they live at our
                            sufferance, to be cold about it. Now, they’re our friends, and we want
                            to support ‘em, but what can they do? Why do we argue with them if we
                            can withdraw if they don’t go along with it? Korea’s the same way.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>: They live at our
                            sufferance.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CJB1">Connally</persName>: Sure, they live at our
                            sufferance. And all I’m saying is—I don’t want to be completely
                            bull-faced, just about 90 percent—but let’s see what they’ve already got
                            that we can take away from them if they don’t want to go. Just don’t get
                            [unclear] and stand back, give ‘em something else.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Johnson</persName>: My point, Mr. President, is not that I
                            oppose the linkage, as such, but I, I would be hopeful that we each
                            accomplish this within the economic framework.</p>

                            chart. We are talking about 34 percent of their exports. We probably are
                            talking about a society that is counting on this growth as part of their
                            national, you know, forward planning. We’re talking about 45 percent
                            growth, and we’re gonna try to talk them into accepting under—between 5
                            and 10 on a third of their exports. And I—my only view is that it’s
                            gonna take [unclear].</p>

                            <persName>Kennedy</persName>: To meet the industry requirements. I mean,
                            we’re gonna have to go from 45 down to 5. Is this right, Maury?</p>

                            that there aren’t some considerable risks in some of those that are on
                            the charts. For example, to increase the allowances of cotton goods, and
                            to put textiles under general preferences, these are things that could
                            not be secret from the rest of the world. And if we put textiles under
                            general preferences for Korea and Taiwan, I think we’d have trouble with
                            South America and in Africa and in all the other countries that would
                            want textiles under general preferences. So, we open up a can of worms
                            there that could cause us a lot of trouble.</p>

                            with the vitality of the two party system in Korea.” He continued: “A

                            returned to office; and a vigorous opposition will sit in the Assembly

                            for use of economic carrots in order to get Korean agreement to

                        <p>This is the memorandum which I mentioned in my memorandum to you of June
                            15, 1971 (Tab B).<note n="3" xml:id="d94fn3">Tab B is attached but not

                            closely with <persName corresp="#p_PPG1">Peterson</persName>’s staff on
                            its preparation.</p>
                        <p>The President on April 16 had approved in principle a list of economic
                            and military carrots for the Korean textile negotiations. You had
                            stressed that if military carrots were to be included, you would wish to
                            be consulted further. The <persName corresp="#p_PPG1"
                                >Peterson</persName> memorandum does not propose military carrots,
                            though <persName corresp="#p_PPG1">Peterson</persName> expresses the
                            opinion that they may have to come subsequently if the economic package
                            is insufficient. Our probable need for military carrots if we negotiate
                            with the Koreans on their Vietnam troop levels would make the inclusion
                            of military carrots in a textile deal doubly difficult.</p>

                            two principal inducements for a Korean textile settlement. They are: <list>

                        <p>Almost all observers agree that the <gloss target="#t_ROKFV1"
                                >ROKFV</gloss> are not now being used to greatest advantage.
                            Decisions on what to do about this situation, however, will involve a
                            wider span of consequences than is immediately apparent. There is of
                            course the series of effects these decisions will have on the situation
                            in the Republic of Viet-Nam. But, there is also a direct connection
                            between what we do about the <gloss target="#t_ROKFV1">ROKFV</gloss> and
                            what the President may want to do in the future about further
                            withdrawals of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces from the
                            Republic of Korea, as well as about overall <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> strategy for Asia. Decisions to follow certain lines of
                            action in our support of the <gloss target="#t_ROKFV1">ROKFV</gloss>
                            could foreclose, at least in part, future options elsewhere which are
                            now available to us.</p>
                        <p>We know that President <persName corresp="#p_NVT1">Thieu</persName>
                            reacted initially to news in April of Korean troop withdrawal planning
                            by saying that he wanted Korean troops to stay in South Viet-Nam through
                                <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1972. Since then, we have not
                            discussed this subject with him. We know, on the other hand, that the
                            Government of the Republic of Korea (<gloss target="#t_ROKG1"
                                >ROKG</gloss>) began troop withdrawal planning some months ago.
                            However, since the Conference of the Troop-Contributing Countries
                                (<gloss target="#t_TCC1">TCC</gloss>) in Washington on April 23, the
                            Koreans have been careful to make no further announcement of their plans
                            beyond saying that the details on units and timing will result from
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ROKG1"
                                >ROKG</gloss> consultations. Furthermore, they have told us they do
                            not expect these consultations to begin in earnest until after the South
                            Vietnamese elections in October.</p>
                        <p>In the context of South Viet-Nam, the <gloss target="#t_ROKFV1"
                                >ROKFV</gloss> issue rests on five years of experience in observing
                                <gloss target="#t_ROKFV1">ROKFV</gloss> performance and providing
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support for the Koreans in
                            Viet-Nam. Initially very effective in combat, <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces have remained generally in the coastal areas to
                            the point where, in some cases, RF and PF forces are now between them
                            and the enemy. They have appeared reluctant to undertake offensive
                            operations and have been useful for guarding only a small sector of the
                            populated area. In fairness, it should be pointed out that this <pb
                                n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0270"/>cautious approach may have
                            resulted from a reported <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> directive
                            to the Korean field commander to minimize casualties.</p>
                        <p>There is another less direct but equally significant impact of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROKFV1">ROKFV</gloss> on our interests in Viet-Nam. The
                            Korean presence there has been characterized thus far by a continual and
                            well-organized pattern of irregular practices. Investigations of these
                            practices have revealed that substantial amounts of <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> funds and property have been diverted
                            from their intended purposes by the <gloss target="#t_ROKFV1"
                                >ROKFV</gloss>. Although dollar losses cannot be stated in precise
                            amounts, the lower limits, as defined by investigations, are in
                            themselves significant, according to Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> and General <persName
                                corresp="#p_ACW1">Abrams</persName>. The results of <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> attempts to curtail the irregular
                            practices of the <gloss target="#t_ROKFV1">ROKFV</gloss> to date have
                            been marginal. With the continuing withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> forces, our capability to improve these results will
                            deteriorate substantially.</p>
                        <p>Essentially, there are four alternatives open to us: <list>

                            the Koreans strongly to remain in strength in Vietnam, they will be in a

                            returns for our financial contribution; and, lastly, that we stipulate
                            in these negotiations that funding arrangements now in effect will
                            continue only to 1 January 1973, with the question of follow-on <gloss

                        <p>Furthermore, at about the same time we negotiate the issues concerning
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROKFV1">ROKFV</gloss>, we should inform the Korean

                        <p>I am concerned about the potential ramifications of National Security
                            Decision Memorandum (<gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss>) 113, dated

                                target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss>, as you may recall, calls for the
                            United States to negotiate the continued presence through <gloss

                            Vietnam (<gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>) security in 1972. Based
                            especially on General <persName corresp="#p_ACW1"
                            >Abrams</persName>’judgments, I believe more effective military use can
                            be made of the resources which would otherwise be diverted to the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> units.</p>
                        <p>I, and the entire command chain within the Department of Defense, share
                            your concerns about the <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> security
                            outlook in the foreseeable future, i.e., through at least <gloss
                                target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1972. We are taking every possible step
                            to insure that no major security problems develop. With declining <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> resources available for application in
                                <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>, we must insure, I believe, that
                            all resources are used to their best advantage. Optimum effectiveness of
                                <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> and third nation forces is
                            paramount.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_ACW1">Abrams</persName> reported to me last
                            January in blunt and emphatic terms that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>s “were not pulling their weight.” Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> concurred in that view. Both
                                <persName corresp="#p_ACW1">Abrams</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> have consistently repeated that
                            view since last January—and, if anything, have reinforced their
                            conviction. The benefits derived from the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>s’ presence in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> may
                            be positive, but are almost assuredly small. On the dollar side, the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> contingent of nearly 48,000 men
                            is currently costing between $250–$300 million. That now represents a
                            relative claim on resources of substantial proportions. The incremental
                            contribution of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s with those
                            resources is almost certainly well below the incremental contribution
                            which could be made with such resources if the funds—or any significant
                            portion of the funds—were devoted to other forces, especially the <gloss
                                target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Occasionally, the options involving retaining or redeploying at least
                            some of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces have been
                            characterized in terms of “something being better than nothing.” That
                            characterization is, I believe, misleading. The options are not
                            something or nothing. The options in using our declining resources and
                            search for optimum effectiveness are “a small something” versus “a
                            bigger something.” The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s currently
                            and prospectively represent a small something. The same resources
                            diverted to the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> would in
                                <persName corresp="#p_ACW1">Abrams</persName>’ judgment represent a
                            bigger something. I support the <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            viewpoint.</p>
                        <p>We might, of course, try to negotiate improved <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> performance. We have been given clear signals by the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s that any increased <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> effectiveness will carry with it an
                            even higher price tag than that now being paid. Such an option appears
                            to me to have (a) little chance of success and (b) an impact in
                            consuming <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>’s increasing valuable
                            time.</p>
                        <p>On 23 June, the same date as the <gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss>,
                            we received informal word from Saigon, as you know, that the Koreans
                            planned to start redeploying their troops in December 1971. They would
                            ostensibly withdraw about 17,000 men by July 1972. Four points, inter
                            alia, are noteworthy: <list>
                                <item>• The proposed <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                    redeployment schedule is clearly not tied to that of the <gloss
                                        target="#t_US1">US</gloss> from <gloss target="#t_RVN1"
                                        >RVN</gloss>, nor, in any apparent way, to that of the
                                        <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> from Korea.</item>
                                <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0277"/>
                                <item>• During the early part of 1972, when a major DRV push may be
                                    expected in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>, the <gloss
                                        target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s would still have the
                                    equivalent of 1½–2 divisions in <gloss target="#t_RVN1"
                                        >RVN</gloss>. Even by 1 July 1972, the remaining <gloss
                                        target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force would be on the order of
                                    30,000 men—more than sixty percent of its current force
                                    level.</item>
                                <item>• The proposed <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                    redeployment should free some resources which could be diverted
                                    to the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>.</item>
                                <item>• The negotiations for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                    redeployment are presumably going to be carried out between the
                                        <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s and the <gloss
                                        target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, a situation which for apparent
                                    reasons, is preferable to that of having the <gloss
                                        target="#t_US1">US</gloss> intervene as middle-man.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>In my judgment, given the circumstances outlined above, it would be best
                            now to take the following steps: <list>
                                <item>• Allow the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s and the

                                    for initiating <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> redeployments
                                    in December 1971.</item>

                                    redeployments after we see how the military situation develops

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I have just completed a very fruitful round of discussions with
                            Ambassador-at-Large <persName corresp="#p_KDM1">David M.
                                Kennedy</persName> regarding the current textile negotiations in the
                            Far East which he is conducting as my personal envoy. As a result, I
                            would like to personally reaffirm to you the very great importance which
                            I attach to settling the textile issue. I must, as well, reluctantly
                            express my regret upon learning that progress toward reaching accord
                            with the Republic of Korea has been delayed.</p>
                        <p>Because I realize that the decision which you must make involves
                            far-reaching political considerations, I would like to emphasize that
                            the United States has attempted to fully incorporate these
                            considerations in its proposals and, therefore, to maintain the special
                            relationship—a relationship whose benefits flow in both directions—which
                            we enjoy with the Republic of Korea. Since I understand that the
                            supplemental economic assistance we propose to offer fully cushions the
                            impact of the U.S. textile proposal on your third Five Year Plan, I feel
                            confident that we may now rapidly move to agreement.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,</p>

                                “The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is a staunch and dedicated
                                ally, and we should continue to cultivate that relationship with it

                                continued: “Starting in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 73, we
                                should plan to reduce U.S. ground force strength in Korea by at
                                least 14,000 additional men. We should maintain a tactical air
                                presence in Korea for the indefinite future.”</note>

                        </p>
                        <p>I visited Camp Casey, headquarters of the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> 2d Infantry Division; Camp St. Barbara, now utilized by
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army artillery units; and Suwon
                            Air Base, home of the 10th <gloss target="#t_ROKAF1">ROKAF</gloss>
                            Tactical Fighter Wing. I found the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> ground units in excellent
                            condition, with modern equipment, up-to-date training, and high morale.
                            The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> artillery unit I visited had
                            assumed a major artillery supporting role from <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> units only six months ago. Both <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> officers were
                            high in praise of the rate and skill with which the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s had assumed their new tasks, even
                            though it had meant transitioning to different and more modern
                            equipment. The consensus was that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>s were as effective as, if not more effective than, the
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> units they replaced. The <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> officials considered this transition
                            illustrative of the overall possibilities for the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s’ assumption of additional ground
                            combat missions.</p>

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Air Force unit I visited was
                            equipped with modern F–4 and F–5A fighters, obsolescent F–86s, and a
                            mixture of relatively modern support aircraft. The base, typical of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROKAF1">ROKAF</gloss> structure, was equipped with
                            sufficient hardened shelters for each of its front-line tactical
                            fighters. As with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> ground units,
                            the skill, training, and esprit of the <gloss target="#t_ROKAF1"
                                >ROKAF</gloss> officers and men were obviously of the highest order.
                            Also, as with the ground units, the leadership provided throughout the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> defense structure was superior.
                            It was apparent that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            modernization program, in general, is proceeding soundly and
                            expeditiously.</p>
                        <p>The single most glaring deficiency is in equipment used by the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Air Force. Some of the aircraft,
                            especially the F–86s, are old and could not be expected to match the
                            equipment now in the North Korean inventory. The modernization program
                            for the <gloss target="#t_ROKAF1">ROKAF</gloss> recognizes the need for
                            better aircraft and includes systematic acquisition of more advanced
                            fighters. I have accelerated the delivery of the ten F–5As in the <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 71 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            program. Those aircraft would have been delivered in March 1972. Under a
                            revised delivery schedule, I specified that they be delivered not later
                            than August/September 1971.</p>
                        <p>I did not have the opportunity to visit <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> naval units. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> officials assured me that the
                            component is also progressing well under the modernization program.
                            Their chief request is for so-called “Fast Boats,” which would be used
                            to counter sea-borne infiltration. “Fast Boats” are included in the
                            modernization plan, though the rate of delivery is somewhat slower than
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s like. In the meantime, <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> officials contend the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s have developed an effective
                            intelligence, air, and sea tactical component which is doing a
                            creditable job in countering North Korean attempts at Seaborne
                            infiltration.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Visit to the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>
                            </hi>.</p>
                        <p>Even a brief visit to the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> is enough
                            (a) to confirm the presence of a persistent enemy, (b) to indicate the
                            intensity with which the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s feel the
                            presence of the North Korean threat, and (c) to illustrate the
                            dedication and effectiveness with which the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>s treat that threat. From an observation post on the
                                <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, east of Kaesong, I saw a wide
                            expanse of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> fence line, a <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> unit on patrol, and at least three
                            North Korean observation posts and firing positions. It is sobering to
                            see the situations which we call on brave men to handle and to witness
                            those dedicated men at their tasks.</p>

                                    level of the individual <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>

                                    the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s have blatantly put an

                            always—they’d always hound him away. He’d kind of back away there, but

                            the governments; they’re tougher than hell out there, I’ll tell you
                            that. Those two governments are, are very, very tough when it comes to

                        <p>I found all the leaders whom I visited frankly appreciative of your
                            personal gesture in sending me as your representative to meet with them.
                            My presence and discussions served as welcome reassurance to these
                            nations which have in the past without exception looked to the United
                            States for understanding or assistance—particularly timely reassurance
                            at a period of rapid change in the international arena.</p>

                        <p>Everywhere I visited, I found that American prestige and confidence in
                            United States policies remain high. All to whom I talked expressed
                            concern and/or bewilderment at the unauthorized publication by our media
                            of confidential government documents.<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2"
                                >Reference is to the publication in <hi rend="italic">The New York
                                    Times</hi> of the Pentagon Papers.</note> However, this episode
                            has not dimmed their confidence that your leadership will continue to
                            guide the American people toward policies and actions that are wise and
                            in the best interests not only of the United States but of the world. A
                            corollary of this confidence was an evident widespread understanding of
                            what you are attempting to accomplish through the “<persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> doctrine.” This policy has
                            brought to other governments a new awareness of their own
                            responsibilities, while at the same time clearly, they hope for a
                            reasonable level of American support for their own efforts. Except with
                            Prime Minister Lee in Singapore, Vietnam did not figure significantly in
                            my conversations, most leaders appearing to approve strongly the current
                            course of American policy there and to be reasonably confident that it
                            will succeed. Two major international problems were of active concern,
                            however, in many areas: the Arab-Israeli confrontation, and the current
                            East Pakistan problem.</p>

                                added that the Korean initiative was probably also seen as evidence

                            <item>This observation produced a long and animated exposition of his
                                strategy in getting the talks started now. The first and most
                                obvious aspect, he said, was to respond to growing public pressure
                                for some kind of contact with the North. The Korean people felt that
                                their government had been an obstacle to the establishment of
                                contacts. It was necessary to demonstrate that this was not so and
                                to relieve the pressure by carefully controlled and regulated
                                interchanges. He saw no prospect, however, that the talks would lead
                                to unification. The ideological differences, he was convinced, were

                                of North Korea and had reached the conclusion that in every
                                significant field of comparison the South had passed the North and
                                with each successive year would be building up an irreversible lead.
                                A physical and psychological barrier was in the past necessary, but
                                this was no longer the case. The balance had been tipped. The South,
                                he said, has nothing to fear from peaceful competition, and contacts
                                with the North will have two beneficial effects. They will show our
                                own people that we can deal successfully with the North and secondly
                                it will give us a chance to open the closed minds of our northern
                                compatriots. The North Koreans are the victims of their own
                                propaganda about the South, he continued. They think we are on the
                                verge of economic and political collapse. The agents that we pick up
                                are full of the most preposterous ideas about conditions in the
                                South. Contacts and a flow of information northward will gradually
                                undermine these illusions and bring pressure on the regime.</item>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HAM1">Haig</persName>, noting that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> had relatively recently
                            assumed his new position, asked him for his early impressions of his
                            job. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> said that one of the
                            first problems that he had come up against was China’s move to get back
                            onto the international scene. As regards the internal Chinese politics
                            of the move, the PLA as well as the civil bureaucracy was supporting
                            this new direction in foreign policy. As to China’s willingness to
                            engage in a dialogue with the U.S., Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2"
                                >Hahm</persName> thought a major motivation was the Soviet
                            question.</p>

                        <p>Addressing himself to the substance of the U.S.–<gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                >PRC</gloss> dialogue, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2"
                                >Hahm</persName> said that he thought that the Chinese would find it
                            easier to tolerate a U.S. rather than a Japanese military presence in
                            Asia because the U.S. has no territorial ambitions. In fact, it could be
                            said the Chinese even need the U.S. in Asia as a hedge against Japan. As
                            regards the Korean peninsula, the Chinese in all probability do not want
                            a U.S. troop withdrawal from South Korea—the U.S. presence is in
                            Peking’s eyes probably an essential guarantee against Japan hegemony
                            over South Korea.</p>
                        <p>As to South Korean views on this question, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> said the top priority for the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government is to prevent another
                            war on the Korean peninsula. If it believed it necessary to attain this
                            object, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government would
                            probably be willing to recognize Pyongyang. However, in making such a
                            move, Seoul would want to extract the maximum possible concessions from
                            North Korea.</p>
                        <p>Most importantly, since President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName>’s statement of August 15 last year, Seoul has
                            pursued a line of trying to induce Pyongyang to recognize and deal with
                            it rather than attempting to overthrow the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> Government through subversion and to use force to unify
                            Korea. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> recognized that
                            such a shift would pose considerable difficulties <pb n="273"
                                xml:id="pg_273" facs="0300"/>for Pyongyang, given its hard public
                            stance on this question. Secondly, Seoul would want North Korea to sit
                            in the U.N. along with South Korea, but on the condition that Pyongyang
                            recognize the competence of the U.N. to deal with the Korean
                            question—although Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> said
                            that his government might be willing to modify this condition to insist
                            only on North Korea’s acceptance of the principles of the U.N.
                            Charter.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the question of a U.S.–China dialogue, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> is probably uneasy over the
                            prospect of too rapid an increase of Japanese influence in Asia. In the
                            light of this, <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> probably would
                            like to have President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>’s
                            assurance that the U.S. has moved from confrontation to negotiation, for
                            under confrontation Japanese influence can increase more easily.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> may also want to ask the
                            U.S. to redefine its relationship with Japan. He thus is seeking U.S.
                            agreement to a new political framework for Asia.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the geo-political importance of the Korean peninsula, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> characterized the
                            peninsula as “a bone stuck in the throat of all three powers” [Japan,
                            China, and the Soviet Union].<note n="2" xml:id="d106fn2">Brackets are
                                in the original.</note> If the Japanese get a foothold on the
                            peninsula, this will be regarded by Peking as a threat. Expressing his
                            own view, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> said that a
                            rivalry between the three powers on the peninsula is intrinsically
                            unstabilizing. Historically, the effect of a Japanese presence on the
                            peninsula and the ensuing three power rivalry was seen in the failure of
                            Teddy Roosevelt’s solution—allowing a Japanese foothold on the
                            peninsula, which only opened the way for a later Japanese move into
                            Manchuria. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> noted in
                            passing that Japan has always justified its military expansion in terms
                            of Japan’s vital need to secure overseas sources of raw materials and
                            markets.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> is much concerned over the
                            possibility of the Korean peninsula being pushed into the Japanese
                            orbit. United States involvement in South Korea is acceptable to
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>—the Chinese will always
                            choose U.S. militarism over Japanese militarism. The U.S. could make its
                            military presence more tolerable to Peking if it (U.S.) would redefine
                            its role in South Korea as that of a referee between the three powers.
                            At present <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> is scared to death
                            that the U.S. will completely withdraw its military presence from South
                            Korea, leaving a vacuum that will suck Japan in.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> said that he found the
                            State Department taking the position that an increasing Japanese
                            influence in South Korea growing out of its expanding investment there
                            is harmless. The Chinese, however, see a vital qualitative difference
                            between U.S. and Japanese investment. The Chinese believe, on the basis
                            of historical experience, <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0301"/>that
                            a resurgence of Japanese militarism will follow almost inevitably from
                            Japanese overseas economic expansion. The present situation gives
                            support for such fears: U.S. markets are being closed to Japan and
                            Western Europe is beginning to show fears that the Japanese will turn to
                            their markets as a substitute. In terms of Japanese overseas economic
                            needs, there is a point beyond which the Japanese will not be able to
                            tolerate this denial of markets. We thus cannot draw too fine a line
                            between Japanese economic and military ambitions. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> also noted that even though it is
                            true that there is no evidence of resurgent Japanese militarism now, the
                            Japanese national character is capable of changing overnight. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> reiterated that the
                            Chinese can live with U.S. military involvement in South Korea, but
                            would find a Japanese presence intolerable.</p>
                        <p>Even Japan would find the disappearance of the U.S. military presence in
                            South Korea to its disadvantage, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2"
                                >Hahm</persName> said. Japan would fear that in the absence of the
                            U.S. military presence there the Chinese and the Russians would take
                            advantage of their geo-political advantage and move down the Korean
                            peninsula. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> explained
                            that with Japan suffering the disadvantage of being separated from the
                            peninsula by a sizable stretch of water, it must establish a presence on
                            the Korean peninsula in order to offset the threat posed by China and
                            the Soviet Union which can move into the peninsula over a continuous
                            land bridge. The Japanese thus would like to see the U.S. stay in South
                            Korea as a shield against China and the Soviet Union. Japan has told the
                            South Korean Government that any further reduction of U.S. military
                            presence in South Korea would leave Japan exposed.</p>
                        <p>At the same time it is essential that Korea not align itself with any of
                            the three powers in order to maintain stability in the area, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> contended, but in the
                            present context the maintenance of the non-aligned stance depends on the
                            U.S. presence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> commented that it would
                            take only one big depression or recession for Japan to go militaristic.
                            He expressed the hope that Japan would be successful in finding a
                            solution to its economic problems without going to extremes but said the
                            Korean attitude was one of caution and skepticism.</p>

                            underlying assumptions that fail to take into account President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>’s policies.
                            Specifically, General <persName corresp="#p_HAM1">Haig</persName>
                            thought Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> misunderstood
                            the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine and the
                            relationship of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>’s
                            China initiative to it.</p>
                        <p>As regards the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HAM1">Haig</persName> stressed the
                            President was not looking for a formula to disengage but rather a way to
                                <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0302"/>stay engaged in a manner
                            that took account of changes in the international scene and in the U.S.
                            He noted that almost any U.S. president would have been faced with the
                            same problem. General <persName corresp="#p_HAM1">Haig</persName>
                            underlined the fact that the U.S. is a Pacific power and that the
                            President’s own record clearly reflects this concern. He admitted that
                            there are forces in the U.S. pulling for U.S. disengagement abroad, but
                            said emphatically that this was not the policy of this administration.
                            The U.S. definitely wants to avoid situations that would leave power
                            vacuums. Another basic principle in this regard is that U.S. commitments
                            proceed from U.S. interests, not vice versa. Given the continuing
                            existence of these interests, U.S. commitments will continue to stand
                            firm.</p>

                        <p>But, General <persName corresp="#p_HAM1">Haig</persName> wanted to know,
                            what was Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName>’s view of
                            Seoul’s recently initialed contacts with Pyongyang? Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> said that his government hoped
                            that Pyongyang would tone down its rhetoric against the South Korean
                            Government. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> noted that
                            in this regard South Korea may now be receiving some indirect assistance
                            from Peking. Tad Szulc of the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> had
                            mentioned to him the previous evening that he had heard recently that
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> had gone to Pyongyang
                            between July 11–15. This could be interpreted, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> said, as an indication that Peking
                            was pressing Pyongyang to make its own actions more consistent with
                            Peking’s changing attitudes toward the U.S.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HAM1">Haig</persName> wondered what might
                            come out of the contacts between North and South Korean Red Cross
                            representatives. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName>,
                            explaining the rationale of Seoul’s initiative, said that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> recognized that his de
                            facto recognition of North Korea implicit in certain of his actions and
                            statements in the past year was unpopular in South Korea: it perpetuated
                            the division between North and South rather than reunifying them.
                            Therefore, President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> was
                            approaching Pyongyang on the question of divided families.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HAM1">Haig</persName> asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> his views on the Vietnam
                            situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> said that his
                            government had misjudged the Vietnamese. South Korea had assumed the
                            South Vietnamese would fight the threat of a Communist take over as
                            fiercely as they had in the early 1950s. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> is now disenchanted with his
                            country’s involvement in Vietnam. Korea became involved in large part to
                            satisfy its obligation to the U.S. Now, however, South Korea finds
                            itself on the receiving end of much criticism from abroad—its troops’
                            behavior in South Vietnam has given rise to an international image of
                            Korea as bloodthirsty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName>
                            said that he himself had been advising President <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> to get out of Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HAM1">Haig</persName> responded that we
                            must confront the fact that we are involved in Vietnam. What we do
                            therefore must be done responsibly <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276"
                                facs="0303"/>and be done in the full light of the realities of the
                            security situation in Vietnam. He thought that Korea should not take
                            over seriously criticism of what it was doing in Vietnam. Much more
                            important, he said, was that we leave Vietnam in a way that South
                            Vietnamese forces will be able to defend the country. This meant that
                            South Korea should plan on leaving its forces there for at least the
                            coming year. Withdrawing precipitously would raise the same danger of
                            instability in Indochina that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2"
                                >Hahm</persName> wanted so much to avoid in the Korean
                            peninsula.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> objected that South Korea
                            has a serious problem domestically as well—it must not be the last to
                            leave Vietnam, or even worse, it must not be kicked out of South
                            Vietnam. Also, if North Vietnam pulls another Tet offensive because U.S.
                            troops have been down to such a low level, the remaining South Korean
                            forces could be left in an impossible position. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAM1">Haig</persName> said that he does not believe that
                            Hanoi retains the capability to stage another Tet offensive. He thought
                            the greater danger would be instability in Indochina resulting from a
                            vacuum created by too rapid a troop withdrawal. He said that South Korea
                            need not fear a complete U.S. withdrawal that would leave it holding the
                            bag. The U.S. will not withdraw before the other side satisfies certain
                            conditions. On the other hand, General <persName corresp="#p_HAM1"
                                >Haig</persName> said, he thought that if South Korea precipitously
                            pulls its forces out, thereby undercutting the <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine’s reliance on Asian
                            nations’ defending themselves, this action would bring even greater
                            criticism on South Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> pointed out that the
                            signals South Korea had been getting from the State Department and the
                            Government of Vietnam were almost tantamount to an invitation for the
                            Koreans to withdraw. President <persName corresp="#p_NVT1"
                                >Thieu</persName> didn’t even bother to send President <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> a letter when Korea informed South
                            Vietnam of its plans to make its first withdrawals. From all of this,
                            Seoul has gotten the feeling that the U.S. attitude was one of “if Korea
                            wants to get out, then let it go.” General <persName corresp="#p_HAM1"
                                >Haig</persName> responded that he did not believe that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NVT1">Thieu</persName> wants South Korea to
                            leave, and again said that he did not think South Korea should attach
                            undue importance to the foreign criticism which Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> had mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> said that he had received
                            the impression during his last visit to the U.S. that the South Korean
                            military presence was not needed. General <persName corresp="#p_HAM1"
                                >Haig</persName> responded that he firmly believed that Korean
                            troops are needed and said that he was very much concerned over the
                            potential results of an early withdrawal of South Korean troops,
                            particularly the impact on the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> Doctrine. General <persName corresp="#p_HAM1"
                                >Haig</persName> commented that we have all come too far and have
                            invested too much in Indochina to give up the ghost now. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> returned to his dismay over the
                            U.S. reaction to Seoul’s notification on its plans to withdraw the first
                            increment of troops. General <persName corresp="#p_HAM1">Haig</persName>
                            countered that this was not the reaction of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, who accorded the highest
                            priority to the realities of the security situation. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> noted in passing that the
                            withdrawal target for South Korean <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277"
                                facs="0304"/>troops which he had had in mind was next May. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HAM1">Haig</persName> said that he thought
                            that it would be well if he discussed this matter further with <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJH1">John Holdridge</persName> when he saw him later
                            today.</p>

                                improve relations with <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> through
                                face-to-face talks. No agreements have been reached, nor were there
                                any preconditions. Secretary said we would not make any decisions on
                                Korea without consultation with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss>; moreover, if there is to be any change in our
                                policy toward Korea we will discuss first with <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. We are hopeful, however, visit
                                will help in reducing tensions which in turn will benefit our
                                friends as well. We are not euphoric, said Secretary, and realize
                                there remain many problems; nevertheless, we believe some progress
                                being made. We expect our friends to understand the rationale for
                                this visit and to trust our judgment. Specifically, so far as <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> concerned, our alliance will
                                continue. We are not thinking of any further reduction of troops in

                                further withdrawals will be consistent with those previously

                            question in the United Nations. This question, which had come up every
                            year since the Korean War, involved three items: the withdrawal of all
                            foreign troops from Korea, the dissolution of <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1"
                                >UNCURK</gloss> (the United Nations Commission on the Unification

                            forward by the Communists in the United Nations.) This year, the United

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim</persName> went on to
                            say that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> was working together
                            with other Asian countries to bring about cooperation on matters of
                            regional concern. For example, it had originated the <gloss
                                target="#t_ASPAC1">ASPAC</gloss> concept, and in fact there had been
                            an <gloss target="#t_ASPAC1">ASPAC</gloss> conference going on in Manila
                            involving nine Asian powers when the announcement was made of Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>’s trip to Peking.
                            This had been on the last day of the conference in Manila. At that time,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim</persName> said, he
                            had made a statement welcoming the President’s forthcoming trip to
                            Peking and expressing the hope that as a result tension might be eased.
                            This was the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> view.</p>
                        <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0309"/>
                        <p>Continuing, <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim</persName>
                            stated that after he had returned to Seoul, Assemblymen had asked him
                            for an elaboration of his views, and had raised the question of whether
                            Korean interests might be adversely affected by this change in the
                            relationship between Communist China and Washington, the capital of the
                            free world. He had then repeated what he had said in Manila about
                            welcoming the President’s visit and hoping that tension would be eased.
                            However, in his mind he had this thing—hostilities between North and
                            South Korea had been suspended for 17 years, and the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> hadn’t done anything against the North;
                            there had been no invasion by the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s
                            of the North. On the other hand, the North had done many things, for
                            example the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident and the Blue House
                            raid, and had received some support for these efforts from the Soviets
                            and the Chinese. <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister
                                Kim</persName> cited an incident which had occurred the day he left
                            Seoul in which four infiltrators had been sent against Kimpo Airport.
                            This had been the first such incident since the Korean War. At the same
                            time, North Korea was receiving large amounts of grant military
                            assistance from the Soviets and the Chinese Communists, which was
                            alarming.</p>
                        <p>So what he wanted to ask Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister
                                Kim</persName> declared, was whether there was still a strong U.S.
                            determination to defend the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. He
                            indicated concern over the possibility that the Communists might
                            increase pressure against the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, which
                            was working hard to take care of its growing population but still had to
                            pay attention to North Korea’s attitude and the actions of North Korean
                            infiltrators. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> had kept more than
                            300,000 boys in the trenches for 17 years, and wanted a release of
                            tension. This could be obtained if North Korea was not supported by
                            China and the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim</persName> said that a
                            second point which he wanted to bring up was the Mutual Defense Treaty
                            which the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> had entered into with John
                            Foster Dulles. The Treaty should be maintained under any circumstances,
                            and with assurance of this the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> could
                            continue its efforts to provide for the welfare of its people. But
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> had spoken to
                            Western reporters about the U.S. getting out of Korea and the abrogation
                            of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> Mutual Defense Treaty.</p>
                        <p>In response, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said
                            that he wanted to make this general observation: <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> could say anything he wanted
                            to and express his hopes as to what might happen in Korea, but we had no
                            obligation to carry these hopes out. We had no intention of giving up
                            the Mutual Defense Treaty, and no intention of negotiating about Korea
                            with <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> could state his position if he
                            wanted to, but Korea would not be the subject of negotiations between
                            the Chinese and ourselves. We didn’t want such a situation, and there
                            was also the question of what the quid pro quo would be. Why should we
                            barter about our friends with someone who was still our enemy? We were
                            not going to gain the so-called good will of China by bargaining about
                                <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0310"/>our friends. We couldn’t
                            keep <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> from saying that
                            he wanted withdrawal of U.S. troops, but that was his problem, not ours.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> knew that our
                            defense commitment remained in full force.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim</persName> said that he
                            was glad to hear these words from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>. Had Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> made this position clear to <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>? Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied that he had had no
                            occasion to do so. The subject had not come up, but he had made clear to
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> that all our commitments
                            would be maintained. He had not, however, wanted to encourage the
                            Chinese to think that they could discuss matters such as U.S. relations
                            with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> with him. Did the Foreign
                            Minister see what he meant? <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister
                                Kim</persName> asserted that he did, of course, see. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> expressed the opinion that
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> may have had
                            problems with the North Koreans, and so might have been obliged to say
                            things for the record which would please the Prime Minister of North
                            Korea.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> observed that as far
                            as South Korea was concerned, we were going ahead with our modernization
                            program for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces, and had no
                            plans to make cuts in our own forces through <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 73. This would get us into the middle of 1973, and into
                            the next administration. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> explained that he didn’t mean to imply there
                            would be reductions in the U.S. forces after July 1973; this was a
                            matter which simply had not been considered at the present time. But
                            from now to July 1973 we had every intention of keeping our forces in
                            Korea. He could speak with complete authority until then, and with good
                            authority thereafter. Basically, there was nothing which <persName
                                corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim</persName> needed to be
                            worried about.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim</persName> thanked Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> for these
                            assurances. he knew that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> had been in Peking, and could speak with
                            authority. But where Japan was in a relatively good position with
                            respect to China, Korea was still a developing country with a long way
                            to go before it attained a strong economy. He tended to agree with
                            Japanese leaders with whom he had talked that China was not in good
                            condition, and its industry was not so big, but China was a “big
                            kingdom” and abrasive in its relations with other countries. However, he
                            was convinced that if “we” (i.e., the U.S. and the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>) showed determination, we could enjoy a
                            peaceful situation. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            emphasized that we, too, wanted a more peaceful situation, but we were
                            not going to bargain about our allies.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim</persName> then
                            referred to the textile issue as something else which he wanted to bring
                            up. One-quarter of the total <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> budget
                            was spent on defense, and Korea’s financial situation was very different
                            from that of Japan. Korea depended extremely heavily on exports for its
                            income, but now had heard from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SMH1"
                                >Stans</persName> that if by October 1 no agreement had been reached
                            with the U.S. on Korean textile exports, then the U.S. would take
                            unilateral action on October 15 <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0311"
                            />to set quotas. The Koreans wanted to continue the talks with the U.S.
                            and get agreement, but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMH1"
                            >Stans</persName>’attitude was very negative.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> commented that the
                            textile question was one which made people mad. It was very complex, and
                            he did his best to stay out of it. However, the trouble was that the
                            President was under enormous political pressure on the textile issue,
                            and if he didn’t produce something, people—particularly those on the
                            Hill—would say “how can you spend all that money for Korean defense?”
                            This was irrational, since it was in our own interests to build up the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> defenses, but <persName
                                corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim</persName> should know what
                            the situation was. Our biggest problem on textiles was with Japan, but
                            we were trying to work out an agreement. He would see what could be
                            done, though, about Korea.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim</persName> noted that
                            developing countries had a great many problems. Things were easier for
                            Japan (even for Foreign Minister Fukuda), since Japan was a developed
                            country. He expressed the hope that a conclusion could be reached in the
                            textile issue through talks, and not just by means of a unilateral U.S.
                            announcement. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            remarked he had to say that if no agreement was reached, then there
                            would be unilateral action. This was a fact of life. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim</persName> responded to the
                            effect that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Minister of Commerce
                            had to report to the Cabinet on his conversations with Ambassador
                                <persName>Kennedy</persName>, and a little time would be needed to
                            find a solution. The Government would need to find a way to bring the
                            businessmen along. He asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> if it would be possible to get this additional
                            time. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said he would
                            see if it might be possible to get an extension and a resumption of
                            negotiations. Ambassador <persName>Kennedy</persName> had delivered a
                            sort of ultimatum in mentioning unilateral measures as of October 15. It
                            had been our understanding last August that Ambassador
                                <persName>Kennedy</persName> would go back in September, but he
                            suddenly said there would be no more negotiations and that the Koreans
                            had either to accept or not accept our position.<note n="2"

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KDJ2">Kim Dong Jo</persName> remarked
                            that the Koreans had spoken to Ambassador <persName>Kennedy</persName>
                            about giving them more time, and he had said he would try to do so.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KDJ2">Kim</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim</persName> jointly explained
                            to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> that Ambassador
                                <persName>Kennedy</persName> had offered a 7% annual growth rate for
                            Korean textile exports to the U.S. if the Koreans accepted the U.S.
                            position by October 1; otherwise the annual growth rate would be limited
                            to 3%. However, much of what would have been included within the 7%
                            growth rate had already been shipped to the U.S. market, and if the
                            Koreans had to stay within the 3% limit they would have nothing to ship
                            at all. In response to a question from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>, they clarified the fact that acceptance of
                            the U.S. position would give them a bigger rate of increase.</p>
                        <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0312"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that he had
                            stayed out of the textile issue and had turned it over to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PPG1">Peterson</persName>. He felt that it was
                            punishment enough for him to have to deal with the North Vietnamese.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim</persName>
                            reiterated his belief that it would be best to find a solution through
                            talks, and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            responded that he would do what he could.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister
                                Kim</persName> asked Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> when the President was going to Peking. He
                            wanted to know this because Korea was very near to China. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied that no date had been
                            set as yet. <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim</persName>
                            again referred to Seoul not being very far from Peking (probably
                            indicating an interest in the President visiting Seoul as well).</p>
                        <p>As <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim</persName> and

                            having become Prime Minister, and might want to visit Washington in this
                            capacity. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that
                            if he did so he would be welcome.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>:</p>
                        <p>It was a great pleasure to renew our acquaintance during my visit to
                            Washington last November. The discussion I had with you then was
                            extremely informative and enlightening.<note n="2" xml:id="d112fn2">The
                                two met on December 2; see <ref target="#d81">Document
                                81</ref>.</note> I regret that since that time I have not been able
                            to maintain regular contact with you due to the heavy burdens and
                            extreme pressures connected with the presidential and general elections
                            in Korea the following spring, and my subsequent appointment to my
                            present post as prime minister.</p>
                        <p>However, I have been kept informed of your continuing support and
                            cooperation on behalf of Korea, for which we are most grateful, through
                            our <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim Yong
                                Shik</persName>, with whom you had meetings recently, and
                            otherwise.</p>
                        <p>In awareness of your basically sympathetic and understanding attitude, I
                            venture to call to your attention by means of this private communication
                            a matter which, as you are well aware, is of vital and urgent concern to
                            my government and my country. I refer, of course, to the crucial stage
                            of negotiations in regard to textile import agreement between our two
                            countries, deadline for which is impending: October 15.</p>
                        <p>You are no doubt familiar with the two years of negotiations over the
                            question of proposed U.S. import restrictions on textile products
                            originating in several East Asian countries including Korea.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d112fn3">On April 13, 1970, Chairman of the House Committee
                                on Ways and Means <persName corresp="#p_MW1">Wilbur Mills</persName>
                                (D–Arkansas) submitted a bill to Congress to institute quotas on
                                cotton, wool, and synthetic textiles. During the remainder of 1970,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration
                                officials urged the Korean Government to work out a voluntary
                                agreement to protect its position. The House of Representatives
                                passed the <persName corresp="#p_MW1">Mills</persName> bill in
                                September 1970. Because the Senate did not pass it before adjourning
                                on December 28, the bill failed to become law. The United States and
                                Korea reached a cotton textile bilateral agreement in late 1970, and
                                it was extended for 6 months on January 1, 1971. Korea filled its
                                quotas in a number of categories early, and such goods, including
                                some types of fabric and print cloth, gloves, tablecloths, and
                                napkins, were embargoed. For documentation, see <ref

                            <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0314"/>You probably know, furthermore,
                            that in the course of these bilateral contacts the Republic of Korea has
                            evinced an understanding and empathy over the difficult circumstances in
                            which the United States found herself, and has endeavored to arrive at a
                            mutually acceptable arrangement in a spirit of good will and
                            cooperation.</p>
                        <p>It has been sometime since the U.S. terminated grant-type aid to Korea,
                            compelling our nation to rely increasingly upon her own devices to
                            sustain economic growth and, at the same time, carry the heavy burden of
                            national defense in an area of Asia which is still far from
                            peaceful.</p>
                        <p>In the face of many difficulties and uncertainties, Korea and her people,
                            under the outstanding leadership of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>, have continued to exert their
                            utmost efforts to attain the goal of complete economic self-sufficiency
                            and self-supporting defense capability by 1976, the last year of our
                            current third five-year economic development program—a goal which is
                            obviously in the American best interests as well as our own.</p>
                        <p>One of the devices employed to fill the gap caused by the termination of
                            U.S. grant aid has been the intensive program of inducing foreign
                            capital, including a significant proportion of commercial credits.
                            These, however, entail in the long run a heavy repayment burden,
                            possibly further aggravating the country’s delicate balance-of-payments
                            situation. There are thus limits to the effectiveness of this
                            approach.</p>
                        <p>Another, more basic, approach is promotion of exports, which involves the
                            issue at hand. It is true that Korea during the past several years has
                            achieved a remarkable increase in her export volume—a circumstance that
                            has been considered both phenomenal and remarkably encouraging by many
                            outside observers. Still, the total has barely reached the sum of one
                            billion dollars, and must continue to increase in order to provide a
                            foundation for the goals of independence and self-sufficiency
                            aforementioned.</p>
                        <p>In Korea’s present circumstances the promotion of exports, particularly
                            the crucial area of textiles, which make up approximately 38 per cent of
                            the total annual export value, is a matter of life and death to the
                            Korean economy.</p>
                        <p>The American position in the present negotiations—position that has been
                            maintained in good faith and no doubt accurately—is that the <pb n="288"
                                xml:id="pg_288" facs="0315"/>U.S. must impose effective import
                            restraints or else face problems of unemployment and business
                            recession.</p>
                        <p>To Korea—which is only one among many, and not the largest, of the
                            textile exporters to the U.S.—the proposed export restraints, if applied
                            in their full rigor, may well spell economic disruption and collapse,
                            with all the grievous attendant consequences for the security of Korea,
                            and the stability of this portion of Asia.</p>
                        <p>Since I fully realize that the issue is also a grave one for the troubled
                            U.S. textile industry, I had instructed Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHR1">Lee</persName> of Commerce and Industry, who
                            recently visited the United States on this matter, not to insist
                            arbitrarily on our own position, but to take the American dilemma into
                            full account. As a matter of fact, we have always tried wholeheartedly
                            to understand the U.S. position throughout the entire course of these
                            long negotiations, asking in return only that your representatives in
                            turn also take into consideration our own unique and crucial
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>We now propose to accept an annual increase rate of 8 per cent—far below
                            the earlier goal and the realistic potential—as our minimum line, the
                            level offered by Ambassador <persName>Kennedy</persName> to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>. Our only request is
                            that the base year and starting date be deferred, based on actual
                            performance during the calendar year 1971, and put into effect from the
                            start of the calendar year 1972.</p>
                        <p>This does not seem to be too unreasonable a request in view of Korea’s

                            seeking to remind all elements of society of Presidential authority and
                            to underline the strict limits within which dissent and criticism will
                            be permitted. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KJP1">Kim Chong
                                Pil</persName>, cast as the government party’s “progressive” since
                            the presidential elections, has avoided association with the unpopular
                            measures inasmuch as he was in Iran when troops occupied Seoul
                            campuses.</p>

                            five months following the April presidential elections, the <gloss

                            with demonstrations by various groups over social and economic issues.
                            But by mid-October the government apparently decided that strong action
                            was required against intensifying student demonstrations in which
                            President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> himself, as well
                            as other government and army leaders, were being attacked by name. On
                            October 15, troops occupied Seoul campuses, and on the same day, the
                            well-known deputy managing editor of Korea’s largest newspaper was
                            arrested on charges of reporting military actions at Korea University in
                            exaggerated terms.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Broad Purposes Involved</hi>. The government was
                            concerned that if the students were unchecked other dissatisfied
                            elements would be encouraged to mount further demonstrations. It also
                            wanted to avoid any appearance <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0317"
                            />of weakness as preparatory talks with the North Korean Red Cross
                            delegation got underway. More importantly, however, action against the
                            students also seems to have been meant as a warning to other elements of
                            the political establishment and the press that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> is still in control and that
                            criticism and obstruction of the government will continue to be strictly
                            limited. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> probably felt such
                            a gesture useful in view of divisions within his own party which, in
                            early October, had resulted in expulsion of several key members and
                            dismissal of the Home Minister. In addition to government party
                            factionalism, <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> was faced with
                            a strong opposition party whose attacks on government policy were
                            gaining wide publicity and which had so far blocked National Assembly
                            approval of the budget. The party’s relatively mild public objection to
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s measures against the
                            students and the equally mild press reaction seem to indicate that his
                            warning has had the desired effect, at least for the moment.</p>

                                considers it very important for two divisions to remain through

                                retention. As <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> had been informed,
                                    <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was prepared to maintain

                            <item>I asked him if what he decribed as government plan with respect to
                                these two divisions was already a firm decision. He said it was not
                                but this was direction in which their thinking had gone. I told him
                                it was much too soon to make such a drastic decision. At this time
                                we believed that two divisions should remain until end of 1972 in

                                until they are able to defend themselves. We also suggest waiting

                                to be present beyond calendar year 1972.</item>

                            <item>Yun said there were two factors that were influencing <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> thinking. First, as far as
                                international situation was concerned, with entrance of Red China
                                and consequent situation at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                continued Korean <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0319"/>combat
                                responsibilities in South Viet-Nam will do <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> great harm. They were concerned about their
                                position in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on matters directly
                                affecting their future. By next summer there would be no combat
                                troops in Viet-Nam except Korean. Keeping two combat divisions there
                                would be hard to defend in international circles.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>Secondly, they are concerned about the security situation on
                                Korean Peninsula. North Korean buildup in preparation for war goes
                                on together with a general trend of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                    >US</gloss> disengagement from Asia. This worried them greatly
                                as they will not be in any position to defend themselves alone for
                                some years. I replied it certainly was much too soon for us to
                                estimate total effect on Korea of Peking’s entry into <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. We should consult between our two
                                governments before coming to any immediate conclusions with regard
                                to the consequences. Presence of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                forces in Viet-Nam would not necessarily work contrary to our mutual
                                interest in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Moreover I cautioned
                                him not to anticipate <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> future plans
                                in Viet-Nam. We would continue to do what was necessary to support
                                South Vietnamese self-determination and we hoped <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> would also. Together we had done
                                much in South Viet-Nam and this was not the time to allow past
                                sacrifices to be lost when perseverance would bring what we sought.
                                    <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was most anxious to retain
                                    <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> contribution and we hoped
                                    <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> would be responsive to
                                this end.</item>

                                    >US</gloss> support both on ground and through modernization

                                fears this had generated among Koreans. I pointed out to him that

                                without necessary support. I replied that administration was working
                                urgently on this and Senate action was not final. I did not believe
                                Korea would be cut off nor did I think he should.</item>

                                ‘72 was necessary. I requested <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
                                not move too suddenly with decisions or announcements of further

                        <p>Thank you for your recent letter in which you comment on the problems of

                                to China, that the U.S. “expedite modernization of the Korean armed
                                forces,” and that the U.S. “not accept Peking’s call for the removal
                                of foreign troops from the Korean Peninsula.”</note> I have read
                            your letter very carefully and have also carefully reviewed the
                            presentation of these views which your Foreign Minister provided to

                        </p>
                        <p>At the very outset, I should like you to know how much I appreciate the
                            generous and helpful support you and your Government have given to our
                            effects to lessen tensions in Asia. It is my earnest hope that my
                            forthcoming visit to the People’s Republic of China will contribute to
                            the development of a stable and peaceful situation in East <pb n="294"
                                xml:id="pg_294" facs="0321"/>Asia and in the Pacific area. By
                            opening a dialogue between ourselves and the Chinese leadership, this
                            journey can lead to better understanding on both sides of the deep and
                            complex differences between ourselves and the People’s Republic.
                            Gradually and over a longer period, such discussions can result in a
                            reduction of tensions in Asia, which would benefit all nations in that
                            area.</p>
                        <p>You can be sure, Mr. President, that in taking steps toward the goal of a
                            peaceful Asia, the United States will not overlook the interest of its
                            allies and friends nor seek any accommodations at their expense. My
                            talks in Peking will not deal with issues primarily involving third
                            countries, but rather will be concerned with bilateral issues between
                            the United States and the People’s Republic of China. Should issues
                            affecting Korea be raised by the People’s Republic of China, I will of
                            course affirm our strong ties with the Republic of Korea. And, as we
                            assured <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim</persName>
                            during his visit, the United States will continue to consult closely
                            with your Government on issues which affect the security of the Korean
                            peninsula.</p>
                        <p>The Republic of Korea has taken its own initiative to reduce tensions by
                            proposing and carrying on talks with the Red Cross societies of the
                            Republic and of North Korea. While I note that the purpose of these
                            talks is to ease the painful separation that has afflicted so many
                            Korean families for so many years, I am encouraged that your Government
                            believes these talks may also lead in due course to the development of
                            further communication and exchange with the north. This is a hopeful
                            sign. I recognize, of course, that the capacity for aggression on the
                            part of the north remains considerable. Nevertheless, the strength of
                            the Korean armed forces and the confidence and dedication of your nation
                            provide a firm and growing deterrent to the kind of aggression from the
                            north to which you refer in your letter.</p>
                        <p>As I said on assuming office, and have frequently repeated since, the
                            United States has no intention of disengaging from Asia. We intend to
                            honor all of our treaty commitments. None of these obligations is more
                            important to peace and stability in Asia than our Mutual Defense Treaty
                            with your country. The modernization of Korea’s military forces which is
                            currently being implemented is clear evidence of United States concern
                            for the defense of Korea. Your own willingness to provide an increasing
                            portion of Korea’s defense requirements is equally clear evidence of the
                            maturity of the Korean economy and of the national pride and
                            self-reliance that has won such great respect for the Republic of Korea
                            in America and around the world.</p>
                        <p>As regards the withdrawal of additional United States troops now
                            stationed in the Republic of Korea, it is our policy under the <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine not to reduce our forces
                            overseas more rapidly than would be consistent with the increasing
                            capabilities of the host country. As we have previously stated, the
                            United States does not now have plans for the withdrawal of additional
                            troops stationed in your country. You can <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295"
                                facs="0322"/>be sure that, before deciding on additional force
                            reductions in the Republic of Korea, we will consult fully with you and
                            will undertake with you a joint assessment of any threat to your
                            country’s security.</p>
                        <p>The events which are now taking place in East Asia may well have a
                            profound effect on the nations of the Pacific for the remainder of this
                            century. I look to your continued support, Mr. President, to help ensure
                            that these events will move us all in the direction of a stable and
                            enduring international order. May I assure you of my highest personal
                            regards and warm good wishes.<note n="4" xml:id="d115fn4">

                                you may say that we find <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                campaign out of step with efforts to relax tensions in Asia, and a
                                possible invitation to Pyongyang for adventurism or miscalculation.
                                These unrealistic intelligence assessments (e.g., Yu’s reference to
                                ninety <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> supersonic twin-jet
                                bombers) are harmful to encouragement of business investment in

                                estimates will soon draw congressional and editorial attention with

                                maneuvering and beginning to wonder whether this is cover for some

                                for example, if <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is casting a
                                wistful eye toward recent events in Bangkok. If so, Koreans should

                                move would have gravest consequences. Would appreciate any further

                                    >Habib</persName> was informed by the Prime Minister’s Special

                                to national security.” (Ibid., POL KOR N–KOR <gloss target="#t_S1"
                                    >S</gloss>) Telegram 7389 from Seoul, December 7, reported on
                                the December 6 declaration of national emergency by President

                                and national security.” (Ibid., POL 15–1 KOR <gloss target="#t_S1"
                                    >S</gloss>)</note> He added hastily that this would not be an
                            emergency declaration in a legal sense as provided for in the
                            Constitution. There would be nothing legally binding about the emergency
                            statement. Rather it was intended to be an exhortative declaration to
                            “awaken” the people and make them realize there were things that needed
                            to be done to assure the security of Korea.</p>
                        <p>2. In the course of the statement, President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> would set forth six points as goals or demands upon
                            government and people. <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName> could
                            only recall four of them such as: (a) Strengthen security; (b) Each
                            individual is called upon to fulfill his part in the security plan
                            whether Homeland Reserve drills, military training or reserve training;
                            (c) The press should refrain from printing provocative or irresponsible
                            articles; (d) The people should be infused with a new appreciation of
                            the security situation rather than be lulled into a feeling of
                            peace-mindedness and security.</p>
                        <p>3. I asked <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName> if there would be
                            any movement of troops in this scheme. He said there would not be any
                            military movements involved in the declaration although there were plans
                            for improving the defense of Seoul which would go ahead. I asked if it
                            was not likely there would be a strong adverse public reaction to
                            emergency controls when public not convinced of necessity. He repeated
                            again that the declaration was not legally binding therefore none of the
                            automatic restrictive measures that would come into play in the event of
                            a formal declaration of emergency would apply. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> was concerned over the degree of
                            apathy of the general public and he wished to bring home the need for
                            full alertness in the face of the continuing North Korean threat.</p>
                        <p>4. I asked <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName> if any measures
                            involving the National Assembly were included. He said none whatsoever.
                            I then asked him if he thought <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0325"
                            />that this move on top of previous public discussion of the danger of
                            North Korean attack and the budgetary increase for defense just passed
                            would together appear as provocations to the North and lead to
                            escalatory reactions on the part of Pyongyang. He replied they had taken
                            this possibility into account and the wording of the President’s
                            statement would be carefully designed to counter any such belief. Also
                            they would be making clear their purpose was defensive and had no
                            aggressive intention.</p>
                        <p>5. I asked him if there was any change in the estimate he had previously
                            given me that there were no indications the North Koreans planned to
                            attack in the near future. He said that he had not changed his estimate
                            and did not believe there was any such intention at present time. He
                            came to this conclusion on the basis of all information available to him
                            including attitude of North Koreans at Panmunjom Red Cross talks.</p>
                        <p>6. He then said he wished to inform me on highly confidential basis of
                            preliminary secret contact with North Koreans. This was not at high
                            level and on North Korean side involved Kim Tok-Hyon (listed in our
                            files as Deputy Chairman of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
                            delegation). He said he preferred not to give me name of South Korean
                            involved. These secret contacts were arranged quietly as occasion
                            permitted at Panmunjom in course of informal exchanges. He was hopeful
                            when time came to use this channel for more serious discussion it could
                            be managed easily with participants at higher level. (We then talked a
                            bit about my experience in secret talks at Paris Viet-Nam meetings and
                            he expressed interest in discussing negotiating tactics and techniques
                            on another occasion.)</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName> said the Panmunjom talks
                            provided an insight into North Korean political thinking and he was
                            using them in this way. In the long run talks had to move in direction
                            of more significant political questions beyond that envisaged under Red
                            Cross cover. Government on each side was controlling talks and would use
                            them for whatever purposes it had in mind.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName> said he would like to pose
                            hypothetical proposition. If secret talks were to materialize at higher
                            level it might be possible to make progress on certain political
                            matters. Let us assume at some time in future agreement was reached in
                            which each side declared it had no intention to take any measure against
                            other; arrangements were made for some communication between people in
                            North and South; agreement was reached for mutual reduction in military
                            forces; agreement was reached that each side would respect other as an
                            entity with implication that reunification was an ultimate but not
                            immediate goal; and each side would accept great power guarantee of
                            agreement reached between them; would U.S. look with favor upon such
                            agreement?</p>
                        <p>9. I replied I normally did not respond to hypothetical questions.
                            However, if North and South Korea were to negotiate mutually acceptable
                                <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0326"/>agreement involving issues
                            of sort he had mentioned to me, I believed U.S. would generally welcome
                            such development. This was an initial reaction which of course I would
                            hope to discuss with him in more detail some other time in the course of

                            not be working contrary to U.S. views if they were to seek basis of
                            accommodation with North. I told him that on contrary we would favor

                            the emergency declaration and is an ever-present concern of the South
                            Korean leadership, <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s move is
                            related much more directly to the internal situation, where he sees
                            stability threatened by a combination of factors including the problem
                            of the presidential succession; the loss of cohesion as the nation’s
                            fear of North Korean hostility and hence its strong anti-communist
                            ideology diminishes; declining <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            support; and potential economic problems.</p>
                        <p>The announcement was <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s third
                            effort in the past three months to tighten his control. In October when
                            National Assembly members from the ruling party joined with the
                            opposition to censure the Home Minister, <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> had several of them arrested, beaten by the <gloss

                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, and then expelled from the party.
                            In November, in response to student demonstrations, university campuses
                            in Seoul were occupied by the military, students were arrested
                            throughout the country, and a senior editor of the nation’s major
                            newspaper was arrested for “exaggerated reporting” of the campus
                            crackdown.</p>
                        <p>The warnings implied in these actions have now been made more explicit by
                            the emergency announcement itself and by proposed legislation penalizing
                            discussions or publication of “military information,” broadly defined,
                            and increasing military authority to requisition private property.

                            <hi rend="italic">Internal Weaknesses Real</hi>. While <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s evident interest in
                            strengthening his control may well stem in part from his own ambitions
                            and his possible desire to succeed himself in power once more, his
                            concern with internal instability is a genuine one. Though in theory a
                            parliamentary democracy, the political system has always revolved around
                            an authoritarian President—first Syngman Rhee and now <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>—and his network of personal
                            followers. The military establishment—<persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName>’s principal source of strength—is the only other
                            cohesive institution in <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0328"/>the
                            society; the National Assembly, the bureaucracy, the political parties,
                            and the commercial-industrial establishment, although slowly developing,
                            are still weak, while the press and academic establishments have little
                            real power or public support. Thus the presidency has had great
                            importance as a means of holding the nation together and giving it
                            direction, and <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>, like his
                            predecessor, has tended to feel that it would be extremely dangerous to
                            permit the position to pass to other hands. However, the elections this
                            spring indicated strong public opposition to the prospect that <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> might indefinitely occupy the
                            presidency; and he may well fear that the struggle over the presidential
                            prize, which is already under way, will inevitably create great
                            instability. Some of his closest advisers (probably including the
                            powerful <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> chief) encourage such
                            fears, as their own power derives from their personal relationship to
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>.</p>

                            changing external situation. A changing economic relationship with the

                            through the surcharge, restrictions on textile imports, and declining
                            Vietnam procurement, thus adding to factors threatening the economic
                            success that <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> regards as his
                            major accomplishment.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the easing of great-power tensions and the softening of
                            cold-war rhetoric with its clear distinctions between “communist” and
                            “free” worlds threaten to weaken the ideological glue that has long
                            served as a partial substitute for cohesive social institutions.
                            Moreover, the prospect of widening contacts with North Korea raises
                            questions about the extent of the threat from across the <gloss

                            government control and national sacrifice. Although <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> himself has publicly welcomed the
                            improvement in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                >PRC</gloss> relations and has tried to adapt to it with a more

                            without an appeal to the threat from the North. North Korea’s prompt
                            reply that it “can not and will not attack” is likely to help confirm
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>’s fear that Pyongyang, with its
                            more highly regimented society, believes that relaxation of tensions
                            will make the South an easier prey.</p>

                            aware of the danger that some government action could provide a cause
                            around which diverse opposition elements—the press, students, academic
                            leaders, the opposition party, the dissidents within his own party—could

                                afternoon December 13 to deliver President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>’s letter (<gloss

                                available for translation just before I called so that he had sole
                                knowledge of its contents.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> opened conversation
                                (which lasted one hour and ten minutes) by saying he appreciated
                                reading the letter in which President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                    >Nixon</persName> showed such a keen understanding of the Korean
                                situation and the security problem in the area. Without further ado
                                    <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> launched into a
                                fairly lengthy statement regarding the recent declaration of
                                emergency in Korea. He said the Foreign Minister had explained to
                                foreign representatives the scope and contents of the proclamation,
                                but the President wanted to place particular emphasis on U.S.
                                understanding of the matter because of our common concerns. He had
                                decided the declaration of emergency was necessary after careful
                                study of the situation in and around the Korean Peninsula. Some
                                Korean and foreign observers seemed to doubt the situation on the
                                Korean Peninsula had become so serious. This is understandable given
                                the general trend in the international community toward peace and
                                détente—particularly when relations between the U.S. and Red China
                                are thawing. But when the big powers make an effort to ease tensions
                                then perhaps some of the weak nations become prey to unexpected
                                incidents. For example, as the U.S. and Red China moved toward each
                                other the Republic of <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0330"/>China
                                suffered from these moves. The Republic of Korea was concerned that
                                it too could become a victim like the Republic of China.</item>

                            <item>Korea recognizes we were seeking to ease tensions in this part of
                                the world and favors such moves, but in their view, peace and
                                reduction of tension in this part of the world required deterrents
                                to any possible aggression. Korea looked upon the U.S. treaty
                                commitment as serving as a mighty deterrent to war. Without it there
                                would have already been a war. It is fortunate that President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has a deep interest
                                in Korea and they appreciate his reaffirmation of U.S. treaty
                                obligations on a number of occasions. Although this treaty serves as
                                a deterrent to war, it is not 100 percent sure. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> said he believes the Korean
                                nation as a whole must have the self-determination and will to
                                defend itself and improve its defense capabilities. This
                                self-reliance together with the Mutual Defense Treaty will make for
                                a more firm deterrent. It would not be right for Korea to depend
                                solely on the U.S. commitment. He felt the need to tell his own
                                people that they must be ready to defend their country and be
                                resolute to this end.</item>

                            <item>Since Red China’s admission to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >UN</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>
                                continued, his government has been studying and evaluating the
                                situation prevailing on the Peninsula in regard to its national
                                security. They expected the Republic of China to speak on behalf of
                                the North Koreans in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> but the
                                fact they had completely supported North Korean policies produced
                                some concern because this meant they favored reunification of the
                                Peninsula by force. This was a danger to Korean security because it
                                must be assumed that statements made by the Chinese Communists were
                                not simply rhetoric but intended to support North Korea fully. Thus
                                the Korean Government had to come up with the necessary measures to
                                cope with the situation.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>I said I would report President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                    >Park</persName>’s views but had some questions and
                                observations. We had been watching the security situation carefully
                                and as the President must be aware we had no evidence a North Korean
                                attack was imminent. If he had any information to indicate this
                                assessment was in error we would appreciate a chance to discuss the
                                facts. The sudden declaration of emergency had attracted attention
                                of the Congress, press and the business community. The estimate that
                                an attack was imminent had aroused concern. This was not surprising
                                given the fact that generally speaking Korea was looked upon as a
                                country which was stable and making rapid progress. Now suddenly the
                                news contained expressions of immediate alarm and this aroused
                                concern. We had already been queried by a number of American firms
                                and others interested in Korea as to the situation.</item>

                            <item>I told <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> we had recently
                                reexamined and improved our intelligence about North Korea’s current
                                preparations. On the basis of the latest information we could still
                                see no indications an attack was <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304"
                                    facs="0331"/>imminent. The U.S. Command was in the process of
                                exchanging information and analysis with the Chairman of the Joint
                                Chiefs of Staff and the Minister of Defense. The results of this
                                latest assessment will be available to President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> and I recommend it for his

                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> replied that he realized
                                there is a continuing joint assessment on the military situation. He
                                will be interested in the latest one. Further, he also understands
                                there are no indications of an imminent attack on the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. However, he said, we must always
                                be aware of the Communist capacity to commit aggression at any time.
                                There may be no indications today but <persName corresp="#p_KIS1"
                                    >Kim Il Song</persName> has the capacity to attack and can pick
                                the time to do so.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>I asked if he considered the possibility that the declaration of
                                emergency and the precautionary steps taken by his military forces
                                might appear provocative to the North Koreans and contrary to the
                                trend exhibited in the opening of Red Cross talks and the general
                                interest in negotiations in the area. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                    >Park</persName> did not reply directly but said the North
                                Koreans were accusing him of being a puppet regime engaged in war
                                preparations on U.S. instruction. This kind of propaganda was not
                                new but at a time when North Korea was trying to make out that it
                                was willing to talk peace they continued to send their agents across
                                the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> is a peaceful country but it is wary of North
                                Korea. <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il Song</persName> knows
                                this. The Korean declaration of emergency had two principal
                                purposes: (a) To warn <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il
                                    Song</persName> that even though there are moves for lowering
                                tension such as Red Cross talks he should not think the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is unwary. The Korean people know
                                that <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il Song</persName> has a sword
                                hiding behind his smile; (b) To warn the Korean public who had
                                fallen into a degree of apathy by believing the international
                                situation is such that war is not possible and peace is in the
                                offing. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> wants his people
                                to realize there is a threat and the North Korean danger still
                                exists. People needed to be warned and shaken from their own
                                apathy.</item>

                                    >Park</persName> had said earlier about small countries being
                                prey to the larger ones and reminded him of the assurances given in

                                    >Nixon</persName> that the U.S. would not seek accommodations at
                                the expense of its allies and friends. I reminded him also of the
                                President’s statement that if issues affecting Korea were raised by
                                the Chinese in Peking the President intended to affirm our strong
                                ties with the Republic of Korea.</item>

                            <item>At this point I said we were aware of President <persName

                                President, however, in his letter sought to respond to all the
                                points previously raised by President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                    >Park</persName>. We will understand if President <persName

                                President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and himself
                                and he would do so. He would not plan to use the assurances given in
                                the letter at this time but will do so at an appropriate time. For
                                example, under questioning in the National Assembly the Foreign
                                Minister could refer to the assurances in the manner we had
                                suggested. Or alternatively if some high official were being
                                questioned by the press it would be very natural to speak of the
                                message received from the President and the assurances contained
                                therein. He would hope to do this in a natural manner rather than
                                arouse too much concern.</item>

                                again to his comments about the emergency declaraton (he appeared
                                anxious to reassure us of his intentions but he also was making it
                                clear that he believed he had good reason to pursue them). <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> said he does not expect
                                complete understanding in the U.S. for his actions. There are even
                                people in Korea who do not understand the true picture. Nevertheless
                                he felt it was necessary to warn his people. It was better to do
                                that than to worry about the apprehension of others. As President he
                                was responsible to take all measures to protect the security of his
                                country. If Canada was in the hands of an aggressive Communist
                                determined to crush the U.S. he was sure that the President of the
                                U.S. would do no less. I replied we understood his concern for the
                                security of his nation and we had demonstrated our commitment to
                                that security for many years. I was sure that between us we could
                                see to it North Korean aggression did not materialize again just as
                                we had seen to it ever since the Korean war.</item>

                                <persName>Kim</persName> said the Korean people were not pragmatic
                                but acted in accordance with their conceptual understanding. For
                                twenty-five years they had placed their reliance upon big power
                                protection, namely, the United States. This had served them well and
                                they had prospered. However, the world was changing and big power
                                interests were such that smaller nations were now uncertain.
                                Although still dependent for ultimate deterrent upon their friends
                                and allies they needed to develop a greater degree of self-reliance.
                                A big power had not been able to prevent the Republic of China from
                                losing its seat in the United Nations. The big powers could not
                                prevent local wars from developing. In the event of such local wars
                                countries involved needed to depend upon their own resources to a
                                greater extent than before. If a country were not sufficiently
                                prepared, it could find itself at a disadvantage.</item>

                            <item>In the past, Korea had looked to the United Nations for its
                                protection. At one stage the United Nations had responded and saved
                                them. But Korea could no longer look to the United Nations which
                                would probably be unable to act in a new emergency. As for the
                                United States upon which their life had depended for so long and
                                still depended, <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> felt
                                that they could no longer be assured of an American military
                                presence. They knew there would be no further withdrawal of U.S.
                                forces from Korea in 1972. Beyond that, however, they could not be
                                sure of what would happen.</item>

                                restrictions. But this was better than the price that would be paid

                                its strength and preparations for war. It was not known when these
                                preparations would be used but <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                had to be alert to the danger. It was better to be prepared for the

                                threat. <persName>Kim</persName> ended his explanation by saying
                                that for all these reasons President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"

                                    corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> was moving. How did he intend
                                to apply the emergency powers he was seeking? How far would he go in
                                terms of individual restrictions or the use of the wide powers of
                                control over the society? To what extent would be apply the economic
                                powers on wages and prices that he was asking? How did he intend to
                                deal with the National Assembly in this situation? Why were these
                                extraordinary powers necessary when by and large the government
                                already had sufficient authority to do what was necessary?
                                    <persName>Kim</persName> replied that only <persName

                                would go. In effect the President would go as far as he felt was
                                necessary to enable the country to meet possible challenges.

                                sought. The general rule was that the powers would be applied only
                                if they were needed and President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                    >Park</persName> would make that determination.</item>

                                without advice and opinion of others. What advice and opinions was

                                consequences of surpassing these limits? <persName>Kim</persName>
                                replied there were a few people counseling moderation but <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> had made it clear that he was
                                determined to have the authority and then use it if it becomes
                                necessary. The desire for the authority was on a contingency basis
                                and no one could deny the contingency. The President believed his
                                present authority was geared to <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309"

                            <item>I asked why emergency declaration was now being supplemented by
                                request for extraordinary powers. <persName>Kim</persName> said
                                    <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> had told him at time
                                of emergency declaration that it would be wise to allow some time to
                                pass to see how public would react. Instead, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> now wanted to push ahead with
                                new law. <persName>Kim</persName> did not know the reason, but
                                believed <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> was strongly
                                influenced by events in East Pakistan where neither big powers nor
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> were able to prevail. Instead,
                                the country that was better prepared won out. He was not going to
                                see <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> in that position. I replied
                                that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> was not in that position,
                                and that it seemed they were discounting U.S. presence and treaty
                                with U.S. much too readily. <persName>Kim</persName> replied they
                                knew their dependence on U.S. was great and they believed greatest
                                deterrent to North Korean attack was U.S. presence. For this reason
                                they wished U.S. division to remain in Korea for indefinite period.
                                But meanwhile they needed to do all necessary to prepare themselves
                                for any contingency.</item>

                            <item>I told <persName>Kim</persName> I wanted to make sure he
                                understood some of the reactions that could be expected abroad and
                                particularly in the United States. Certainly people would find it
                                difficult to understand the reasons for these latest actions which
                                would appear retrogressive. Korea had an extraordinarly good
                                reputation abroad as a progressive nation. There would be concern
                                expressed at the course of events. I recounted for him what we had
                                already seen on this in the press, in the Congress and among
                                business firms interested in Korea. It was inevitable that the
                                concern expressed after the declaration of emergency would now be
                                increased in the face of the new legislation and the circumstances
                                surrounding its passage. I told him that any action contemplated
                                which would seriously affect the National Assembly would arouse
                                immediate and fundamental concern.</item>

                            <item>He said the government majority expected to secure passage of the
                                bill in this session. At this very moment the rostrum of the
                                Assembly was being occupied by a group of opposition Assemblymen. He
                                did not believe all members of the opposition were so adamantly
                                opposed to the bill but one faction led by <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KDJ1">Kim Tae Chung</persName> appeared determined
                                to disrupt the Assembly and prevent passage of the bill. It might
                                become necessary for the government to take abnormal measures to
                                pass the bill. I remarked that I hoped this wasn’t a warning of a
                                meeting at 2:30 in the morning. He caught the implication and
                                replied that he hoped they would not do anything more extra-legal
                                than the sort of thing done in the Japanese Diet to pass the Okinawa
                                Reversion bill.</item>

                            <item>He then went on to express concern as to extent President

                                through the methods it was currently applying. I told him again in
                                quite positive terms that action against the National Assembly would
                                    <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0337"/>be detrimental and
                                would not be understood. He replied that in general he believed
                                Korean people would understand measures taken within the Assembly in
                                such circumstances. The public was not that concerned over what they
                                saw as political in-fighting. The public would be more concerned if
                                the government were to misuse its authority in the administration of
                                the country.</item>

                                public could receive that assurance. He said only <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s actions would be the test

                            <item>I asked if he did not foresee the possibility the North Koreans
                                would view the recent spate of actions in the South as provocative
                                and, in turn, escalate their own actions to a point where tensions
                                would be increased substantially with all the dangers that would
                                imply. He said the North Koreans were already at a maximum state of
                                readiness and all they would do would be to redeploy some of their
                                forces in a more aggressive stance. On the other hand South Korea
                                had absolutely no intention of provoking an attack on the North at
                                any time. If anyone were to even make such a suggestion he would
                                resist to the utmost.</item>

                                <persName>Kim</persName> said he would be busy trying to persuade
                                opposition to be reasonable in the Assembly in order to permit
                                government to be reasonable in its actions in return. However,
                                President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> was absolutely

                                his responsibilities. The use of emergency powers was normal in
                                extraordinary circumstances, and Korea was in such a

                                he and the Prime Minister know from my conversations with them that
                                there are aspects of the emergency decree and the related actions
                                following it which create problems for the U.S. They know that
                                significant elements in the government, press and Congress regard
                                the steps as politically retrogressive, and that the business
                                community is concerned. I have been as frank and direct as I can be
                                in stating and re-stating these reactions, and we must assume they
                                have been weighed in the President’s decision and that he has
                                decided to proceed nonetheless. To stop him in his tracks, I would
                                need much more. Not a mere warning of the possibility of declining
                                American support, (which he already expects) but a flat statement of
                                some specific, unavoidable consequence or series of consequences
                                would be required, plus the determination to put them into effect if
                                he persisted.</item>

                            <item>An alternative course would be to continue what we are now doing:
                                responding to requests for our views coming to us from figures in
                                government, the legislature and the community in general; being sure
                                that the Korean Government has a complete feedback on reaction from
                                the U.S.; refraining from direct intervention and allowing the
                                counter forces in Korean society to develop, to resist and correct
                                possible government excesses.</item>

                            <item>We are inclined towards the second alternative. President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> knows he cannot take
                                us for granted, and we can hope to moderate his actions although not
                                altering his basic conception. He is perceptive enough to see that
                                we can accelerate the American disengagement that he fears, and we
                                can play on that fear. We would let <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                    >Park</persName> and key officials know that while we will not

                                he is making continued support of <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> by U.S. administration difficult. He should
                                therefore understand if he uses powers granted to him under other
                                than clearest evidence of serious emergency, no assurance can be
                                given that U.S. people, Congress, and administration will continue
                                to provide him with moral and material support they have given in

                                        <persName>Kim</persName>, thus showing desire for a leader

                                    the April 1971 presidential election, Koreans had wanted

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> has asked for military and
                            political assurances regarding its forces in Viet-Nam if it is to keep
                            two divisions there through <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1972.</p>
                        <p>We think we can provide acceptable military assurances, although not in
                            the exact terms requested, based on current support levels until U.S.
                            forces reach the 30,000 man level. After that the U.S. capability will
                            begin to decrease. At the 15,000 man level it will not be possible to
                            support <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces unless additional
                            U.S. personnel are retained in Viet-Nam specifically for that purpose
                            (our best estimate is 1,735 men).</p>

                        <p>I have reviewed the paper that the Under Secretaries Committee has sent
                            to the President concerning the <gloss target="#t_ROKFV1">ROKFV</gloss>
                            and believe the appendix to the summary memorandum presents a balanced
                            view of the problem.<note n="2" xml:id="d129fn2">See <ref target="#d128"

                            participated fully in its preparation. The summary memorandum is a State
                            Department product. Although I support the paper in general, I continue
                            to doubt the efficacy of the <gloss target="#t_ROKFV1">ROKFV</gloss> as
                            I made clear last June when we were considering this question (<gloss

                        <p>In any consideration involving the retention of significant <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military forces in Vietnam, I believe
                            the following points to be of major importance: <list>
                                <item>—The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss
                                        target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> should be the prime members in
                                    resolving the question. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                                    role should be secondary, in support of the <gloss
                                        target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s needs. Such an approach was
                                    implicit in <gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss>–113, but I
                                    sense that we are moving away from it.</item>
                                <item>—We should be careful not to link possible <gloss
                                        target="#t_US1">US</gloss> redeployments from Korea with
                                    retention of the <gloss target="#t_ROKFV1">ROKFV</gloss>. <gloss
                                        target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss>–113 prohibited tying together
                                    these two separate issues. If the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                        >US</gloss> should make a commitment in these talks to
                                    retain the Second Infantry Division beyond <gloss
                                        target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 73, as State recommends, we will
                                    have established such a link. I oppose this commitment since it
                                    reduces the flexibility of our forces by precluding the
                                    deployment of that division to meet other contingencies. The
                                    reduction of our forces, which this Administration has so ably
                                    accomplished, has made flexible deployments essential to our
                                    national security.</item>

                            However, <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName> has decided to send
                            one of his own <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> men to P’yongyang
                            (via P’anmunjom) instead of the newspaperman. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName>’s man was to proceed to North Korea
                            on March 28 with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Red Cross
                            representatives who were traveling to North Korea for talks with their
                            counterparts, but would remain behind when the others came back. Chargé
                            Underhill and the Chief of Staff of the United Nations Command were
                            informed, and the latter made the necessary arrangements.</p>
                        <p>It appears that the initiator of these feelers on the North Korean side
                            is the younger brother of <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim
                                Il-song</persName>, Kim Yong-chu. If the initial contact between

                                Hu-rak</persName> will attempt to meet with Kim Yong-chu personally
                            in P’yongyang. He <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0352"/>has discussed
                            this possibility with President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Pak</persName>, who has not taken a position yet. However,
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName> is confident that
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Pak</persName> would accept his
                            recommendation that he visit P’yongyang. No other senior <gloss

                            developments.</p>
                        <p>As <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName> sees the situation, the
                            contacts will probably not lead to early reunification, but rather to
                            the prevention of war and accidents. <persName corresp="#p_LHR1"
                                >Yi</persName> will emphasize trade and exchanges rather than

                                <item>—Logistic support. Our capability to provide logistic support
                                    from U.S. facilities will diminish once our force level drops
                                    below 30,000 until at 15,000 no U.S. support could be provided
                                    without a special U.S. personnel increment of about 1,700 men
                                    for this purpose. Currently about 5,000 U.S. personnel provide

                                    have developed an alternative plan involving a combination of

                                    which would reduce the requirement for U.S. personnel to 1,733.

                                    Also, another summit meeting before your Moscow trip is

                        <p>The February 4 <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> aide mémoire did not
                            raise these subjects, and I do not believe that we should, at least in
                            this context.</p>
                        <p>A significant factor not mentioned in the study is that the <gloss

                            approximately $190 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970 and
                            $120 million in 1971. At the present the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1"
                                >ROKG</gloss> is facing severe financial problems and is quite aware

                                >SVN</gloss>, but I also believe they actually prefer to have their

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> began by referring to the
                            question of the two <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions in
                            Vietnam. Although President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Pak</persName>
                            had accepted the need for keeping these divisions in Vietnam until at
                            least the end of 1972 and perhaps into 1973, “some of his advisors” were
                            concerned over the problem that this might create for the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> next fall. Possibly the <gloss target="#t_PRC1"
                                >PRC</gloss> might be more inclined because of the presence of these
                            divisions in Vietnam to raise the Korean item in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly. In addition, there
                            seemed to be criticism on the part of the American public and press with
                            respect to the fact that the two divisions are staying on.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> wondered, wouldn’t it be
                            possible, therefore, to make a token withdrawal of Korean forces from
                            Vietnam starting this summer? Only enough troops would be withdrawn to
                            suggest that the process had begun and certainly not enough to affect
                            the military situation. What did Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1"
                                >Holdridge</persName> think of this?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> first ascertained
                            that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> was, in fact, one
                            of the advisors to President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Pak</persName>
                            who had raised this issue. He went on to state that he was in no
                            position to do anything other than to pass along Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName>’s remarks; however, it looked very
                            much as if the Communist attacks in Vietnam might continue through the
                            summer, and it would create an extremely unfortunate impression if the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> began even a token withdrawal at
                            this time. In addition, the two <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            divisions were playing a very important part in establishing the
                            military balance in Vietnam, and it was imperative that they be kept on.
                            In the <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0360"/>present situation, for
                            example, one of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions was
                            helping to open Route 19 and was performing a very important function.
                            It was precisely for this reason that we had asked the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government to keep the divisions
                            on.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> remarked that, as
                            far as the attitude of the American people and press was concerned, he
                            personally was not aware of any particular American criticism over the
                            presence of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops. Even papers
                            such as the <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi> and the <hi
                                rend="italic">New York Times</hi> had not brought up this matter for
                            months. It was possible that there would be those among American
                            academic circles who would be critical, but certainly this would not
                            reflect the attitude of the American people as a whole. The average
                            American, if he knew about the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            participation in Vietnam at all, would probably say that this was a good
                            thing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> doubted that the
                            question of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops in Vietnam
                            would affect one way or another the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>
                            attitude on the Korean item in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            General Assembly. The Chinese would in all probability make their
                            decision as to what position they would take on the basis of a
                            long-range calculation of their national interest, to which the issue of
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops was peripheral.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> mentioned that there
                            seemed to be criticism of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> from
                            some American groups, particularly academics, over what appeared to be
                            lack of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> responsiveness to North
                            Korean peace overtures. The problem for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName>
                            explained, was that it would be very difficult for President <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Pak</persName> to say anything which suggested
                            acceptance of two Koreas. The 1948 Korean Constitution, in fact, was
                            drawn up in such a way as to conceive of only one Korea, and Korean
                            nationalistic sentiment on this point was very strong. Inherent in North
                            Korea’s approach, though, was a definite two Koreas implication—the
                            North, for example, called for a peace treaty between the North and the
                            South which could only be negotiated between two sovereign powers.
                            Americans didn’t seem to understand this situation, or the difficult
                            position into which President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Pak</persName>
                            was put by their criticism.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> stated that there was
                            nevertheless one condition under which two Koreas would be acceptable:
                            if North Korea offered to renounce the use of force against the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. Under such circumstances, a two Koreas
                            situation condition could be justified as an <hi rend="italic"
                                >interim</hi> step pending final reunification at some point later
                            on.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the two Koreas question, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence in Korea had been helpful for a
                            long time in maintaining the one Korea concept. Since 1948, the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> (United Nations Commission for
                            the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea) had personified this
                            concept. Under present circumstances, though, conditions were no longer
                            the same. (<hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> He did not elaborate, but
                            appeared to be indicating some degree of willingness to consider some

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> emphasized that if
                            there was any criticism about President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Pak</persName>’s position, it was not from the Administration. We
                            understood President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Pak</persName>’s
                            sensitivities and certainly would not do anything to interfere with his
                            judgement as to what course his country should take. The U.S.–<gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> Joint Communiqué had in fact made it
                            very plain that we would not get out in front of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, but rather would support South Korean
                            initiatives directed toward a relaxation of tension in the Korean
                            peninsula.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> reported that a number of
                            American journalists had apparently received invitations to visit
                            Pyongyang for the 60th birthday of <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim
                                Il-sung</persName>. Included among these had been Harrison Salisbury
                            and Selig Harrison.<note n="3" xml:id="d134fn3">Harrison Salisbury was a
                                    <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> reporter. Selig Harrison
                                was the Northeast Asia Bureau Chief of <hi rend="italic">The
                                    Washington Post</hi>.</note> Both had said that they were going,
                            but now the invitations had apparently been withdrawan as a result of
                            the stepped up fighting in Vietnam. North Korea evidentally felt it
                            undesirable to have Americans present in Pyongyang at this particular
                            time. But a number of Americans were still interested in going, e.g.,
                            the Dean of the Emory Law School and an American-Korean professor at
                            Bridgeport University. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName>
                            added that he had heard there was also some possibility of North Koreans
                            coming to the U.S. in the guise of members of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> delegation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> commented that he
                            had not known of the travel of Harrison Salisbury or Selig Harrison to
                            North Korea. The fact of the matter was that we would find it very
                            difficult to prevent such travel, and the publicity if we tried to do so
                            would be very adverse. We would not encourage travel of Americans to
                            North Korea, though. As for the North Koreans coming to the U.S. as
                            members of the Chinese delegation, this did not appear very likely since
                            the Chinese to date had been very scrupulous in their relations with us.
                            It would be far more likely for the Chinese to propose that North
                            Koreans come via a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> invitation for them
                            to attend the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> session which would
                            contain no conditions. Such would almost surely be the case if the
                            Chinese brought up the Korean issue next fall.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> said that there was still
                            a possibility for contacts between the North Koreans and private
                            Americans, at least. Under these circumstances, the U.S. should do what
                            it could to help the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> make contacts
                            with both the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. This would be most desirable prior
                            to the visit of Americans to North Korea in any significant numbers.
                            Speaking frankly, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> had already
                            asked France to act as an intermediary between it and both the <gloss
                                target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>, and the French had agreed on the proviso that this be
                            kept strictly confidential. But perhaps the U.S. might also be able to
                            render assistance in some way.</p>
                        <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0362"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> said that he did not
                            offhand know how the U.S. might be helpful, but if the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> came to us with any suggestions, we
                            would certainly want to give these due consideration.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> said that the various
                            points he had raised in the conversation indicated a need for closer
                            contacts between the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to
                            make sure that each side knew what the other was thinking and to avoid
                            misunderstandings. By way of further elaboration, he mentioned that as a
                            result of the President’s July 15, 1971 announcement of his intended
                            China visit, followed by the textile issue, and then by the cut in U.S.
                            military assistance to Korea, President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Pak</persName> had begun to worry about the state of basic
                                U.S.–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GM1">Marshall Green</persName>’s visit had reassured him
                            greatly, but more continuous high-level contact would still be
                            desirable. In the impending visit of <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Kim
                                Yong-shik</persName> Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> would of course be
                            seeing certain higher level U.S. officials, but what was really needed
                            was a brief meeting between President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Pak</persName>. This need not be long—perhaps only 45 minutes—but
                            the contact itself would be the important thing. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> did not comment.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_HPC2">Hahm</persName> concluded the
                            conversation by expressing the hope that Americans would continue to
                            invest in Korean economic development. This was desirable both in terms
                            of assisting in the expansion of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            economy and to prevent Japanese investments from dominating the economic
                            scene. The Japanese were becoming increasingly hard to deal with, e.g.,
                            when the Koreans raised objections to Japanese terms for investment, the
                            Japanese would cite <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s
                            “4 points” and threaten to pull out entirely in favor of dealing with
                            the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> instead. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName> agreed with the desirability
                            of continued American investment in Korea.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: What’s happening to the <gloss
                                target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces around Kontum?</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: Three Ranger
                            battalions are being airlifted out of Ben Het, and the <gloss
                                target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces are concentrating at FSB
                            Metro.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: Is the 22nd Division getting back
                            together?</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: Yes. About 1,500 men
                            from the division will be reformed, and the remaining elements of the
                            division are continuing their movement to Vo Dinh. The 47th Regiment is
                            being reorganized south of Pleiku, and it will probably move up. This is
                            rugged country, from the air support point of view. In this connection,
                            I want to mention that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s have
                            gained the high ground at the An Khe pass. They report killing 238 of
                            the enemy. We have a message in from General <persName corresp="#p_MJH1"
                                >Michaelis</persName> [U.S. Commander in Korea],<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d135fn4">Brackets are in the original.</note> saying that
                            the Koreans want to make sure we have an evacuation plan prepared, in
                            case their positions are overrun by the North Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: That’s not new. They asked us some time
                            ago to prepare this evacuation plan.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: This message came in
                            before the recent action at the An Khe pass, too. The Koreans have made
                            a big contribution to the effort to open up Highway 19.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: Is the Highway open now?</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: No. But it will be
                            open fairly soon. At the same time, the Koreans are nervous about their
                            positions. And that’s why they want the evacuation plan to be ready.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>: If I recall
                            correctly, the evacuation plan was a basic part of the bargain we made
                            with them to retain the two divisions in Vietnam. We agreed to draw up
                            the plan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Negroponte: Yes, but it was to be used when there was an emergency in
                            Korea, not in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>: You mean it is a
                            plan to return them to Korea, if they are needed there?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Negroponte: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HAM1">Haig</persName>: As long as this
                            question has come up, let me discuss something that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry</persName> was certainly going to talk
                            about. When the President sees the Korean Foreign Minister this morning,
                            he will ask the Foreign Minister to inform <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> of our hope that the Korean forces become more <pb
                                n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0365"/>actively engaged in II Corps.
                            Since the President is going to do this, isn’t it a good idea for the
                            President to send a message today to <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName>? The message could inform <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> of the augmentation measures we
                            have taken and of our determination to do what is necessary in Vietnam.
                            The message would also ask <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>
                            to coordinate with the JGS and <persName corresp="#p_ACW1"
                                >Abrams</persName>, with a view towards taking decisive action in
                            this critical situation.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: We should mention the
                            latest action at the An Khe pass, too.</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HAM1">Haig</persName>: We know that Abe
                            [Abrams] doesn’t like to use the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s.
                            We are past the point, though, where we can ignore them. The Koreans
                            must get out of their enclaves and take over some of the activity in
                            their portion of II Corps.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rush: They’ve been guilty of some atrocities, you know. That’s one
                            reason Abe doesn’t want to use them.</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HAM1">Haig</persName>: I understand that. We
                            don’t want to push Abe into a situation he won’t be able to handle.
                            Still, we should get some action out of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: I can’t understand
                            why <persName corresp="#p_ACW1">Abrams</persName> doesn’t want to use
                            them to help open up Highway 19. They can work on opening the road,
                            especially in the area north of the road. In other words, they just have
                            to expand their area of operations a little more.</p>
                        <p>We originally had the 173rd Airborne Brigade in the area north of Kontum.
                            When the brigade was pulled out, part of the 22nd <gloss
                                target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> Division went in there. Then the old
                            3rd <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> Division—which we estimate to be
                            the worst of the <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> units—moved down
                            there. The enemy has been roughing up the countryside and blocking
                            Highway 1. Now it would be good if the Koreans could just work their
                            area, without really going very far.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: (to Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HAM1"
                                >Haig</persName>) You think we should just make a general
                            exhortation to <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> in the letter
                            from the President?</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HAM1">Haig</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>: We should recognize
                            that a letter from the President to <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> will undoubtedly result in a Korean request for
                            something which will cost money. Do we want to get into that kind of a
                            situation?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rush: What would the Koreans ask for?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: We’re negotiating with them now in
                            several areas.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>: They’ve already said
                            they need $18 million just to move out of the enclaves.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rush: We don’t want them to move to another area. We just want them
                            to make their area safe.</p>

                            always welcomed the opportunity to meet with strong and long standing

                            to Korea. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> had
                            insisted on this not only in conjunction with drafting the Shanghai
                            communiqué; but also, and perhaps even more importantly, in the oral
                            exchanges between himself and the Chinese leaders. The President also
                            emphasized that President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>
                            could be assured that similar support would be expressed in Moscow
                            although he did not foresee that the Korean question would arise except

                            was intensely interested in the successful completion of the
                            modernization of their armed forces. He noted that the first year of the
                            modernization program had been most successful but that some
                            difficulties were now developing due to Congressional attitudes and that
                            our two Governments were discussing this on a regular basis.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> asserted that it
                            was his personal intention to see that United States commitments toward
                            the modernization of the armed forces of the Republic of Korea would be
                            met. However, at this time, there were many difficulties with respect to
                            Congressional attitudes on the whole subject of military aid and foreign
                            assistance. Nevertheless, Korea had many friends within the United
                            States legislature and momentary difficulties should not be overplayed.
                            In any event, as the President of the United States, he intended to do
                            everything possible to insure that American commitments for the
                            modernization of the Korean armed forces were met.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim</persName> then stated
                            that as a result of the stepped up fighting in South Vietnam, his
                            government had expressed concern about the security of their 50,000-man
                            contingent. He noted that earlier his government had considered a more
                            expedited withdrawal of their forces, but that as a result of an urgent
                            request from their South Vietnamese friends they had limited this
                            withdrawal to one marine <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0368"
                            />brigade of roughly 10,000 men. Now that the fighting was stepped up
                            there was concern about the security of the remaining forces. There was
                            special concern because the Korean Government believed that it was
                            essential that Korean forces have the same level of support which they
                            were accustomed to receiving when United States force levels in Vietnam
                            were higher. Now, as U.S. forces were withdrawn, the provision of
                            helicopters and similar support was in jeopardy. Consequently, they were
                            conducting intense discussions with General <persName corresp="#p_ACW1"
                                >Abrams</persName> to insure adequate support was provided.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> replied that the
                            United States recognized that the enemy’s flagrant violation of the
                                <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and their massive conventional
                            invasion of South Vietnam represented the ultimate challenge to all of
                            the non-Communist nations in Asia. If the North Vietnamese, with their
                            sophisticated weaponry provided by the Soviet Union and China, were to
                            succeed, then certainly the threat would be greatly increased for the
                            Republic of Korea itself. More importantly, Moscow would be encouraged
                            to continue this kind of proxy aggression. Therefore, it was incumbent
                            upon all to take the battle to the enemy in South Vietnam and to achieve
                            an important victory as a result of the recent enemy action. The United
                            States for its part had more than doubled its air activity in the
                            theater and intended to apply air power relentlessly to destroy as many
                            of the enemy as possible. He noted that the Korean forces had now moved
                            out on some of South Vietnam’s highways and were intensifying their
                            operation. This was a period when all free nations involved in the
                            conflict must move aggressively to defeat the North Vietnamese invasion.
                            He personally was dedicated to doing all that was necessary.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim</persName> observed
                            that Korea, of course, was always subject to criticism, especially since
                            U.S. forces were withdrawing and Korean forces remained. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> stated that he would
                            insure maximum U.S. support was garnered for Korea’s participation in
                            the defense of South Vietnam. In the United Nations, Ambassador Bush
                            would do everything possible to register U.S. support for Korea’s help
                            to South Vietnam. In the Congress, Korea has many friends and we would
                            influence them also to maintain support for Korea.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim</persName> then
                            commented that the Republic of Korea had been in touch through the Red
                            Cross on the humanitarian problem existing between North and South
                            Korea. They had consciously adopted a program which would deal first
                            through the Red Cross on the humanitarian issues and then if the talks
                            were successful shift to more sensitive political issues. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> noted that this was a
                            matter for the Republic of Korea. The United States, of course, welcomed
                            any progress that might be made between North and South Korea, but it
                            was not an issue that the United States would attempt to <pb n="342"
                                xml:id="pg_342" facs="0369"/>manipulate as a third party. We
                            welcomed improving relations if this was possible but we expected the
                            Government of South Korea to be the ultimate judge of the degree to
                            which the dialogue should be carried on.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim</persName> then
                            expressed the wish of President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> would have an opportunity to visit Korea soon.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> answered that he
                            intended to make such a visit because he had many Korean friends and he
                            had long been close to many of Korea’s American friends here in the
                            United States. Nevertheless, because this was an election year, it would
                            be impossible for him to undertake any more foreign travel after the
                            visits associated with the Soviet Summit were concluded. Nevertheless,
                            he would hold a subsequent visit to Korea high on his agenda. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KYS1">Foreign Minister Kim</persName> said that he would
                            convey this message to President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> and wished to emphasize again as President
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> had done in his letter
                            to the President, that the Republic of Korea was fully behind and
                            supported the President’s visit to the Soviet Union and wished President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> every success in this
                            endeavor.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister commented that his discussion with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> had been fruitful and
                            that he had enjoyed a game of golf the previous Sunday at Burning Tree
                            Country Club. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>

                                    >US</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Japan,
                                and most recently China—have tacitly accepted the existence of “two
                                Koreas”; in effect abandoning the idea of reunification, but they
                                differ in their perceptions of the problem and hence on modalities.
                                The Soviets appear to have concluded that, in the absence of any
                                real hope for peaceful unification, the best course in Korea is a
                                negotiated <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0373"/>accommodation
                                between North and South, but the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss> must move cautiously to avoid antagonizing
                                Pyongyang. The Japanese seem quite ready to accept some form of
                                gradual reconciliation of the two Koreas, provided it is
                                orchestrated in a way that does not disrupt Tokyo’s overall efforts
                                to achieve a modus vivendi with Peking. China, concerned to prevent
                                the growth of Soviet influence in North Korea, is greatly interested
                                in achieving some kind of explicit agreement, but must not get out
                                ahead of Pyongyang, which still wants to unify Korea under its
                                control. Thus, any negotiated arrangement formalizing the
                                peninsula’s division is difficult to foresee.</item>

                                talking to one another at several levels. Open negotiations in the
                                Red Cross talks were initiated in the latter part of 1971,
                                ostensibly to open the way for reuniting the many Korean families
                                separated since 1945. There are also covert discussions, but these
                                are mainly exploratory and meaningful progress toward a political
                                settlement would seem to be some time away.</item>

                                that its new conciliatory tactics will complicate South Korea’s
                                foreign relations and ultimately lead to dissension in the South
                                which Pyongyang can exploit. This has been coupled with an
                                imaginative diplomatic drive abroad seeking certain other
                                intermediate objectives: the withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                    >US</gloss> troops from the South; limitation of Japanese
                                influence there; and recognition of North Korea’s legitimacy by the
                                international community. The South, on the other hand, is worried
                                about the domestic effects of any amelioration in North-South
                                relations and concerned as well over the possibility of a complete
                                    <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military withdrawal. The
                                Republic of Korea is acting cautiously. It wants to move only at a
                                very deliberate pace and to keep the public talks limited.</item>

                            <item>The prospect is for the Red Cross talks to be prolonged. Although
                                there is nervousness on both sides, domestic and international
                                opinion, pressures from their allies, and the momentum generated by
                                the talks themselves may lead to agreements on divided families,
                                cultural exchanges, and even trade. Progress on these issues, in
                                turn, could help reduce fears and suspicions on both sides and tone

                                political confrontation. This might bring about something of an

                                occur and could at some point escalate to open hostilities. Northern
                                responses in such circumstances would depend heavily on Pyongyang’s
                                perception of both its own allies’ support and the <gloss

                                Ultimately, therefore, the question of war or peace in Korea would
                                come to rest, as before, on the decisions of the <gloss

                                being neglected by the United States. Most specifically, they
                                exhibit a degree of unhappiness over events in Vietnam in which they
                                see themselves being swept along by currents concerning which they
                                have no knowledge, and over which they have no control.</item>

                            <item>Some of this they accept as inherent in their minority position as
                                a remaining partner in Vietnam. Nevertheless, they believe that as
                                our last ally with troops fighting in Vietnam we should share with
                                them, to some degree at least, our plans and strategy. We have had
                                some second echelon levels in the government express disappointment
                                that we have not recognized, either in our public statements or in
                                our private efforts, the contribution of the Korean forces and the
                                risks and dangers they also run if there were to be a North
                                Vietnamese breakthrough.</item>

                            <item>These feelings have been behind Korean refusal to agree to an
                                expansion of their area of operation in Vietnam and also explain
                                Korean reluctance to commit themselves unequivocally to maintaining
                                their forces in Vietnam through the end of 1972. We have been able
                                fortunately to take advantage of the timely presence of Ambassador
                                Brown to counter the indications that some elements in the Korean
                                Government were proposing early withdrawal of Korea’s divisions in
                                Vietnam. The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister showed clear
                                understanding of the desirability of maintaining those forces
                                through 1972 but, nevertheless, set forth their expectations of
                                greater support from the United States in return. The commitment is
                                however not iron-clad, and we should not assume that under all
                                circumstances they will retain their forces there.</item>

                            <item>Generally speaking, we are seeing a rising trend of Korean concern
                                that the U.S. takes them for granted and that we also are less than
                                prepared to share in advance those discussions of strategy and
                                actions which we are pursuing in regard to matters directly

                                The Korean leadership has an umblemished record in protecting our
                                confidences. I see no reason why we cannot discuss frankly and fully
                                with President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> the
                                course of secret negotiations with the North Vietnamese, our plans

                                future and to keep him reasonably well informed of our dealings with
                                the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China. If we do so, I
                                am convinced we will find him understanding and cooperative. If we
                                do not, we are courting unpleasant surprises.</item>

                            I am glad that we are continuing to have a close and candid exchange of
                            thoughts on matters which are so important to our mutual desire for
                            peace and progress in Asia.</p>
                        <p>We believe that our quest for a dialogue with the Chinese and Russian
                            leaders will contribute to these goals, and your support of that quest
                            is something I deeply appreciate. We recognize that there are wide
                            differences between their views and ours, but we feel that conversations
                            about these differences can have highly worthwhile consequences for <pb
                                n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0379"/>all of us. I am happy to report
                            that this was the case in the People’s Republic of China, and I hope it
                            will be the case in the Soviet Union as well.</p>
                        <p>I can assure you, Mr. President, that the United States will continue to
                            place high importance on the interests of its friends and allies. My
                            talks in Moscow, like those in Peking, will concern primarily bilateral
                            issues. We will take no action at the expense of our friends nor enter
                            into any agreement which would compromise their future. Should the
                            Soviet Union raise any issues affecting Korean security, you can be sure
                            that I shall once again affirm our strong ties with the Republic of
                            Korea. I will also make known our intention to maintain and further
                            develop our close bonds, and to adhere to our defense commitment to your
                            country.</p>
                        <p>In the past we have known the unpredictability of the North Korean
                            leadership, and we are very much aware that military forces arrayed in
                            North Korea continue to pose a threat to your nation and your people. We
                            share your concern that the North not make the mistake of increasing
                            tensions. I must add, however, that we have no information now which
                            indicates that North Korea plans to initiate hostilities in the near
                            future. Nevertheless, we must not relax our guard.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, we have noted your efforts to talk with the North about
                            matters such as divided families. As was stated in the Joint Communiqué
                            between the United States and the People’s Republic of China of February
                            28, 1972,<note n="4" xml:id="d142fn4">See <ref target="#d127fn2"
                                    >footnote 2, Document 127</ref>.</note> “The United States will
                            maintain its close ties with and support for the Republic of Korea; the
                            United States will support efforts of the Republic of Korea to seek a
                            relaxation of tension and increased communication on the Korean
                            Peninsula.” Of immediate importance in this general connection, my
                            Government will look forward to cooperating closely with yours in
                            dealing with the Korean question in the United Nations General Assembly
                            next fall.</p>
                        <p>While we search for peace, Mr. President, we intend to remain strong. As
                            you know, we plan no changes in the level of our forces stationed in the
                            Republic of Korea through the end of Fiscal Year 1973. We have also
                            outlined for you our planned force disposition in Asia. Before
                            undertaking any further reduction of United States forces in Korea, we
                            will consult fully with you and make a joint assessment of any threat to
                            your country’s security.</p>
                        <p>The five-year program for modernizing your military forces continues to
                            be of great importance to us. We are happy that we have been able to
                            provide support for this program during its first two years— <pb n="353"
                                xml:id="pg_353" facs="0380"/>some $440 million in grant funds, and
                            approximately $16 million worth of excess defense articles and the
                            equipment of the division which we withdrew from Korea in Fiscal Year
                            1971. I recognize Korea’s impressive efforts to become self-sufficient
                            in defense, and regret the reductions caused by the Congressional action
                            in military assistance for Fiscal Year 1972.</p>
                        <p>Spokesmen for my Administration, in their appearances before our
                            Congress, have emphasized the significance of military assistance to our
                            allies, and in particular the importance of the Korean military
                            modernization program. Korea is well and favorably known to the leaders
                            of our Congress, and I believe, therefore, that our assistance programs
                            will move forward at an adequate level in the coming years.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the ten percent deposit requirement under Section 514 of the
                            Foreign Assistance Act of 1971, my Administration has no alternative but
                            to comply with the provisions of the law. However, as you are probably
                            aware, this requirement applies only to deliveries of military
                            assistance made beginning February 7, 1972. Further, my Administration
                            does not favor this requirement, and we have called for its repeal in
                            Fiscal Year 1973.</p>
                        <p>As a Pacific nation, the United States has a special regard for its Asian
                            allies. We have said on several occasions over the years that we intend
                            to honor our obligations to Korea, and we believe our intentions are
                            understood by friend and foe alike. We share your view concerning the
                            necessity for frequent and close discussions between our Governments,
                            and I am pleased that our representatives will again be meeting to
                            discuss these matters at the annual Republic of Korea–United States
                            Security Consultative Conference in Colorado Springs.</p>
                        <p>Thank you very much for your good wishes. As you know, I place the
                            highest value on our friendship. You have my warmest good wishes as you
                            lead your country forward in these critical times.</p>

                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HAM1">Haig</persName>: Anything else,

                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: The North Vietnamese
                            have completely moved the 320th Division from around Kontum City to the
                            Kontum Pass. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_ACW1">Abrams</persName> would
                            like to get the Koreans to help open the Kontum Pass. They did a good
                            job clearing the An Khe Pass and he wants to use them the same way on
                            the Kontum Pass. The problem is that it would require a decision by the
                            Korean President. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces need
                            Presidential approval to move out of their base area.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>: Can we lift them up
                            there?</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: Oh, sure. No problem
                            on that.</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HAM1">Haig</persName>: I think we should draft
                            a message to Korea asking the Korean President to authorize his forces
                            to make a temporary movement to open up the pass, and assuring him that
                            we will provide the necessary airlift.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>: Would they return to
                            their base camp after the pass is opened?</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: Sure. It would be a
                            one-shot deal. We’re still waiting for the South Vietnamese to move up
                            from Pleiku to open the pass. They may do so yet, but <persName
                                corresp="#p_ACW1">Abrams</persName> says this is one exercise the
                            Koreans could undertake. If the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            forces don’t do it within the next day or two, we should give the
                            Koreans the initiative.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>: This is on Route 14
                            between Pleiku and Kontum?</p>
                        <p>Adm. <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>: That’s right. We can
                            move the Koreans to Pleiku and then on to the pass. They don’t have
                            enough North Vietnamese in their base area to keep busy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>: We can draft a
                            message to Korea.</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_HAM1">Haig</persName>: I’ll get it to the
                            President when he returns and see if he wants to go that strong in a
                            message to <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>.</p>

                        <p>The North Vietnamese invasion of South Vietnam has bogged down badly and
                            is well behind schedule. Our South Vietnamese allies have stiffened
                            their defenses on all three fronts and have taken a heavy toll of the
                            enemy.</p>
                        <p>However, General <persName corresp="#p_ACW1">Abrams</persName> informs me
                            that the South Vietnamese lack mobile reserves for some of their
                            immediate problems, especially in the Second Military Region. One of the
                            most pressing problems with which they are unable to cope is the task of
                            reopening Kontum Pass on Route 14 between Pleiku and Kontum.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_ACW1">Abrams</persName> feels this is a
                            mission which could be effectively performed by a combination of Korean
                            and United States forces, operating against a limited objective for a
                            limited period of time. Once the pass is opened, he believes our two
                            forces could retire, and the terrain could be held secure by the South
                            Vietnamese forces now available to the Second Military Region. He also
                            assures me that the requisite Korean forces could be temporarily spared
                            from the area where they normally operate.</p>
                        <p>Under this concept, the United States would be prepared to contribute the
                            airlift, the helicopter units, the air support, and other associated
                            support elements. The Korean contribution would consist of combat
                            elements temporarily withdrawn from their current area of
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>I would very much like to have our two countries cooperate in this
                            particular effort to assist our South Vietnamese allies. I feel that a
                            successful mission of this type would have psychological as well as
                            military benefits which could instill a helpful momentum into the
                            defense of Kontum.</p>
                        <p>If you share my view, I would greatly appreciate your authorizing the
                            Commander of the Korean Forces in Vietnam to work out the details <pb
                                n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0384"/>of the mission with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_ACW1">Abrams</persName>. If your reply is
                            favorable to such a combined mission, I will then instruct General
                                <persName corresp="#p_ACW1">Abrams</persName> to provide the United
                            States elements essential to the proposed operation.<note n="2"

                                    >Park</persName> stated that he believed that “the operation of
                                recapturing Kontum Pass would be one of the most difficult missions
                                of the Korean forces in Vietnam, involving many casualties on our
                                part.” However, he added, “in consideration of Your Excellency’s
                                special request, I have decided to offer assistance of the Korean
                                forces in the Kontum Pass operation. Korean combat elements will be

                            <item>I called on President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>
                                for an hour’s talk June 10. This was our first meeting since my
                                return to Seoul. After assessing my health and his for a few minutes
                                (he is now recovered from effects of a fall and looks well) the
                                discussion developed as follows.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>I thanked him on behalf of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                    >Nixon</persName> for the decision to keep Korean troops in
                                Vietnam until the end of 1972. I noted that military situation
                                seemed better there although enemy was persistent and we could
                                expect some difficult periods ahead. I emphasized President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>’s determination as
                                shown by recent <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> actions taken in
                                air and on sea in Vietnam and spoke briefly of necessity to assure
                                achievement of our objectives in Vietnam which are related to
                                general credibility of our commitments elsewhere. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> nodded vigorous agreement and
                                was pleased to receive President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                    >Nixon</persName>’s recognition of <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> decision on troops.</item>

                            <item>I then spoke of widespread interest in contacts between North and
                                South Korea. This was general as far as Red Cross talks were
                                concerned, but also applied to those who were aware of the secret
                                talks. I noted the general admiration in the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                    >US</gloss> for the initiatives taken by <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> and the skillful manner in which discussions had
                                been pursued, and thanked him for instructing his subordinates to
                                keep us fully informed. I asked him for his assessment of the
                                contacts with North Koreans, what he considered to be North Korean
                                objectives, how he saw the talks evolving, and what time-frame did
                                he foresee as ruling in pursuit of his own purposes.</item>

                            <item>
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> asked if I had been
                                briefed on the latest meeting.<note n="2" xml:id="d145fn2">See <ref
                                        target="#d147">Document 147</ref>.</note> I replied that

                                past few days but I expected to meet him early next week. He said
                                    <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName> was away resting but
                                he would ask him to give me the details. Meanwhile his Secretary
                                General Kim Chong-Yom would give me a quick run-down when he had
                                finished our meeting. (See below)</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> said he would have
                                another talk with me about this question at a later date. He was
                                pursuing the matter of contact with the North carefully and with an
                                eye to what was practical. At this point he wished to see some
                                progress on the issues involved in the Red Cross talks, such as the
                                beginning of plenary meetings, the movement of people back and
                                forth, and the opening of communication. He believes in making some
                                progress on the smaller, easier issues and working toward the
                                solution of more difficult issues. Unfortunately the North Koreans
                                have tried to move immediately to generalized political discussion
                                of the major issues and wanted such things as early summit meetings
                                between himself and <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim
                                    Il-sung</persName>. This was impractical and the Communist
                                proposals seemed to be directed more to impressing third parties
                                with North Korean desire for solutions rather than to achieving
                                practical results.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> thought that talks would
                                take time to get anywhere. He considered it possible that North
                                Koreans would back away when it came to some practical results, such
                                as mutual visits, communication between people on both sides of
                                    <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, and other realistic
                                actions. The Red Cross talks were a good test of North Korean
                                readiness to move ahead and only time would tell how far this could
                                go. He, like all Koreans, was suspicious of the North Koreans on the
                                basis of the past record and he would move to test their
                                sincerity.</item>

                            <item>He then discussed situation in North Korea briefly mentioning
                                recent articles in Japanese press, and the series by Salisbury and
                                    <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Lee</persName> in <hi rend="italic"
                                    >The New York Times</hi>. (He was critical of biased nature
                                Japanese <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0386"/>reporting but
                                thought <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> articles were quite good.) He
                                noted evidence of garrison state mentality, personality cult and
                                tightness of controls. The nature of life in the North made him
                                wonder if <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-sung</persName> really
                                was prepared to expose his people to outside influence. He agreed
                                that it will be very interesting to see the effect of the first
                                non-official contacts, if and when the Red Cross talks open the
                                way.</item>

                                formal, and that the terms of references were vague. As of now they
                                viewed the arrangement as a channel for communication which could
                                permit discussion of such things as ways to facilitate the Red Cross
                                talks, or clearing up misunderstandings that could arise over

                                    >Park</persName> had spoken of distrust of Northern intentions
                                on part of Southerners and desire not to cause uneasiness or

                                Contacts should therefore be implemented on a gradual basis, with
                                such actions as family visits, communication between North and

                                    >Park</persName> had also told Pak Sang-chol that now was not

                            <item>Kim Chong-yom then said that President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"

                                interested in “dividing South Korea’s national consensus” and

                                He was also concerned that North is trying to mislead the American

                                    <persName>Kim</persName> said North Koreans proposed that

                                for a meeting in June. No response was made then, but President

                                Generally speaking the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> was not
                                interested at this moment in political meetings at a senior level in

                                to have them in a third country. As for the coordinating committee,
                                it could communicate at a lower level. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1"

                                    who surround him. [Incidentally, as you may have noted, Harrison

                                <item>—State concludes that it is a healthy development that
                                        <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi Hu-rak</persName> recognizes
                                    that the North Korean leadership does not have the high degree
                                    of strength and vigor that the South Korean leadership
                                    previously has attributed to it. This should contribute to a
                                    greater degree of self-confidence among <gloss target="#t_ROK1"

                        <p>State suggests that it is time to take another look at North Korean
                            intentions. I am somewhat skeptical that another analysis of available
                            evidence at this time would measurably clarify Pyongyang’s current
                            intentions.</p>
                        <p>The evident questions, it seems to me, are what <persName
                                corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-song</persName> hopes to gain from his
                            switch in tactics that began late last summer; to what extent he feels
                            constrained by Peking’s altered approach—and by Soviet policy as well;
                            and to what extent Peking and Moscow are willing to use what influence
                            they have in Pyongyang to restrain <persName>Kim</persName> should this
                            be necessary. Tentative answers to these questions should become more
                            evident as a result of North Korea’s political discussions with the
                            South, from Pyongyang’s approach to the Korean question in next fall’s
                            U.N. General Assembly, from the conduct of their current diplomatic
                            campaign to improve the <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss>’s
                            international position, and from the level at which they keep their
                            continuing harassment of the South through infiltration and
                            subversion.</p>
                        <p>Related to this, I find State a bit overly hopeful as to
                                <persName>Kim</persName>’s current purposes, and a bit too
                            insensitive as regards the risks of exploring the possibilities of
                            expanded U.S. contacts with Pyongyang. These risks include loosening the
                            political and social cohesion of South Korea, increasing friction
                            between ourself, Seoul, and Tokyo, and possibly leading Pyongyang to
                            miscalculate our intentions toward the security situation on the Korean
                            Peninsula.</p>

                                me, stating he had taken a rest in the countryside beginning almost
                                immediately after the North Korean delegation’s departure from
                                Seoul. <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName> said he had
                                returned to Seoul only on 12 June and had not yet briefed other
                                    <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> officials on developments
                                connected with North Korean delegation’s visit. <persName

                                one of which contained what he described as a complete record of the
                                minutes of the North Korean delegation’s visits with President

                                himself. The second folder contained accompanying memoranda and

                                the transmission of these documents to the Department. From an

                                delegation was composed of five representatives: Vice Premier Pak

                                <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi Hu-Rak</persName> said he thought
                                that the most important result of the visit was the achievement of
                                an “agreed coordinating committee,” which <persName
                                    corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName> did not want to describe
                                otherwise as formal or informal or as official or unofficial. Pak
                                Song-Ch’ol had brought with him from Pyongyang an official proposal
                                that a coordinating committee be established. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName> pointed out that this proposal
                                had resulted from his own initiative in suggesting a means of
                                coordinating North-South relations during his earlier visit to
                                Pyongyang. In addition to the coordinating committee, Pak Song-ch’ol
                                had suggested during his discussions with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi Hu-Rak</persName> that several other
                                committees be established. According to the proposal the
                                coordinating committee would deal with political and unification
                                matters and there could be additional committees for military,
                                economic, and other subjects. <persName corresp="#p_LHR1"

                                need for them seemed more apparent. He suggested to Pak Song-Ch’ol
                                that agreement be reached on a comprehensive frame of reference for
                                the coordinating committee along the lines of improving relations
                                between North and South Korea and resolving problems between them.
                                Pak Song-Ch’ol accepted <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName>’s
                                definition of the functions of the coordinating committee. The

                            <item>Pak Song-Ch’ol proposed the issuance of a joint communiqué on the
                                fact of these visits and discussions, but President <persName

                                According to <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi Hu-Rak</persName>, the
                                most important problem now facing the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1"
                                    >ROKG</gloss> with respect these developments is when, where,
                                and how to make a public announcement about them. Both President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi Hu-Rak</persName> feel the need to proceed
                                cautiously and think that this is not yet the right time to bring
                                out the fact and content of these exchanges. One of their principal
                                concerns is that the U.S., Japan, and other third countries might
                                conclude too quickly that tensions on the Korean Peninsula were
                                being effectively resolved. Another main consideration is the
                                continuing need to prepare the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                population properly in terms of national morale and unity.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>At this point, I expressed the view that it would be advantageous
                                for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to make the fact of
                                these developments public as soon as feasible. I told him that,
                                during my discussion with President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                    >Park</persName> on June 10, I had mentioned there was already
                                widespread talk in the diplomatic community here about secret
                                official visits back and forth between Pyongyang and Seoul. I
                                mentioned to <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi Hu-Rak</persName> that
                                information had already leaked out within the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> about his own visit to Pyongyang
                                and I reminded him that, almost inevitably, there would be a major
                                leak sooner or later. I reassured him that the U.S. Government would
                                avoid giving any impression of reducing our presence or commitments
                                here at this time. I expressed the opinion that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> population would welcome positively
                                these initiatives and that President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                    >Park</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi
                                    Hu-Rak</persName> would receive overwhelming support from the

                                situation that existed even a year or two ago. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi Hu-Rak</persName> answered that he thought
                                “99 pct” of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> population would
                                welcome these developments but public disclosure of the recent

                                feel that it would tend to downgrade the value of these meetings for
                                    <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName> to make an early

                                sufficient authority to make such meetings very productive. His own
                                thinking is that the next step will wait on an official invitation
                                to Pyongyang, which has not yet arrived but which he expects will be
                                forthcoming. After a suitable interval, assuming that an invitation
                                is received, <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName>’s view is to
                                counter-propose a meeting in a third country with Kim Yong-Chu

                                thought that Paris or Geneva might provide a suitable meeting place.
                                After their meeting, <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName> and

                                statements announcing the establishment of the coordinating
                                committee. The text of the communiqué or separate statements would
                                have been prepared in advance at the working level and agreed on
                                before proceeding to whichever third country was selected for the
                                meeting. The text would be limited in content and would be shaped
                                along the lines that the North Korean and South Korean
                                representatives were working to reduce tensions on the Peninsula and
                                that they would exercise influence toward persuading their
                                respective governments to move toward policies and programs
                                promoting this objective. <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName>
                                said he had made no reference to a third country meeting in his

                            <item>I asked <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi Hu-Rak</persName> whether
                                any progress had been made during these discussions on expediting
                                the Red Cross talks. <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName>
                                answered that he agreed with my impression that North Korea may be
                                engaged in a certain amount of foot dragging. He thought that the
                                North Koreans had not yet completed physical and other preparations
                                for the plenary sessions and he could not predict when the first
                                plenary session would be held. He expects that the preliminary
                                meeting on 16 June will result in an agreed agenda. There would then
                                be another preliminary meeting after which it should be possible to
                                predict a date for the plenaries to begin. I said I thought it
                                important to maintain the momentum of the Red Cross talks and
                                mentioned that President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>
                                had referred during our discussion to the usefulness of these talks
                                in testing North Korean intentions. <persName corresp="#p_LHR1"
                                    >Yi</persName> did not expect that momentum in the Red Cross
                                talks would be lost.</item>

                            <item>After the North Korean delegation’s departure for Pyongyang,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName> made a complete report
                                on their visit to President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                    >Park</persName>. Both President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                    >Park</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName>
                                concluded that the visit had been a very successful one from the
                                    <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> point of view. They believed
                                that agreement on a <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0392"
                                />coordinating committee was a useful accomplishment. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> thought that it was good that
                                the North Korean representatives had been able to see Seoul and its
                                environs for themselves. <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName>
                                said the North Koreans were “amazed” and impressed with Seoul and
                                with what they had seen during their visit to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. They seemed impressed with the
                                meticulous preparations which the South Koreans had made for their
                                visit and for the future reception of their Red Cross delegation.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName> thought they were
                                impressed also with the nature and freedom of relationships between
                                President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi Hu-Rak</persName> in the give and take of
                                discussions and courtesies. He said the North Korean representatives
                                conducted themselves like “robots” and were unwilling to hazard
                                anything that looked like personal or independent thinking. He
                                commented that Pak Song-Ch’ol, during his meetings with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi Hu-Rak</persName> and even with President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>, confined himself to
                                reading a prepared text from a notebook he carried in his pocket.
                                His conclusion was that <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim
                                    Il-Song</persName> is the only North Korean leader who can talk
                                freely and Pak Song-Ch’ol had even less authority than Kim

                            <item>During this discussion, <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName>
                                said that the “hot line” telephone between him and Kim Yong-Chu has
                                been used only twice by the North Koreans. About 15 December,
                                Pyongyang had called to report that <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> troops at the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>
                                had fired more than 500 rounds of machine gun ammunition and the
                                North Korean troops intended to retaliate. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName> asked for delay and was able to
                                report back to Pyongyang that the troops had been firing only at
                                phosphorescent lights coming from dead tree trunks, lights which the
                                troops had thought were carried by hostile soldiers. Pyongyang
                                accepted this explanation and avoided retaliation. On the second
                                occasion, Pyongyang had called to explain that North Korean troops
                                had fired several machine gun rounds at three or four <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> soldiers who had wandered north of

                                impression that future developments in private negotiations depend
                                to a considerable degree on the next step he is waiting for, namely
                                the receipt of an official invitation to visit Pyongyang.</item>

                            comes at a time when the United States has begun to make major
                            adjustments in the terms of its relations with the People’s Republic of
                            China and the Soviet Union. In choosing among the options available

                        </p>
                        <p>In the past the umbrella of the United Nations presence has been of
                            assistance to the United States in carrying out its policies in Korea
                            with the approval of the international community. Specifically: The
                            United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of
                            Korea (<gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss>) has provided an agreed
                                U.S.–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> approach to the question of
                            Korean unification which has the endorsement of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. However, it has long since completed its
                            contribution to the rehabilitation of Korea and has never been able to
                            carry out its mandate on <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0394"
                            />unification since it has never been accepted by the other side. Its
                            presence is symbolic and as North-South bilateral contacts grow even
                            this value diminishes.</p>
                        <p>The United Nations Command has provided a means acceptable to the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> for U.S. operational control of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces; has been the
                            guarantor for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> side of the
                            Armistice Agreement terminating the Korean conflict; and has provided
                            the only useable channel of communication between the U.S. and North
                            Korea. The question of its present usefulness is more complex but the
                            presence and treaty basis of U.S. forces in Korea is independent of the
                            Command. However, the ability to use Japanese bases in defense of Korea
                            is related to <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> arrangements.
                            Dismantling the Command would require a review of the value of these
                            arrangements, revision of the present bases of U.S. operational control
                            of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces and adjustments to

                        <p>Basically, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> apparatus in Korea is an
                            increasing anachronism and a problem for the United States, particularly
                            in the United Nations. Time can only erode support for the present
                            arrangements devised during the cold war confrontation; increasingly the
                            various states are indifferent to the issue or convinced the <gloss

                            international situation. It will thus require increasing U.S.
                            expenditure of time and effort to maintain these arrangements with less

                            total ground force in Viet-Nam will be slightly larger than our own by

                        <p>State analyzes <persName>Kim</persName>’s four-phase troop reduction plan
                            as follows: (The four phases are demilitarization of the <gloss
                                target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, reduction of North and South Korean
                            forces by 150,000–200,000 each, conclusion of a North-South peace pact,
                            and last, the withdrawal of U.S. forces and the reduction of the armed
                            forces on both sides to 100,000.) What is new in
                                <persName>Kim</persName>’s proposed demilitarization of the <gloss
                                target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> is not the idea itself—this has
                            previously been proposed by our senior U.N. negotiator in the Military
                            Armistice Commission and by South Korea—but the modality:
                                <persName>Kim</persName>’s proposal that it be negotiated between
                            Seoul and Pyongyang directly. This, of course, would undercut the U.N.
                            role in Korea, a prime first objective of North Korea [and one that it
                            is pursuing as regards next fall’s U.N. General Assembly session, which
                            it would like to see abolish <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss>
                            and nullify the 1950 aggressor resolutions].</p>

                        <p>As regards <persName>Kim</persName>’s second phase, State comments that
                            the proposal for an interim reduction is new; <persName>Kim</persName>
                            in the second point of his Eight Point Program for Korean Reunification
                            (broached in April 1971) called for the reduction of armed forces North
                            and South to 100,000 or less. The proposed interim reduction would leave
                            South Korea with an advantage of 150,000–200,000 more troops over the
                            North (the present strengths are 612,000 for South Korea and 383,000 for
                            North Korea). [Seoul’s apparent military advantage would be offset at
                            least in part by what is regarded as the generally superior North Korean
                            reserve force system, numbering between 900,000 and a million. In
                            addition, it assumes that <persName>Kim</persName> would agree to
                            effective verification of force reductions, and that
                                <persName>Kim</persName> believes agreement on such an interim
                            reduction could really be achieved.]</p>
                        <p>As State suggests, <persName>Kim</persName> no doubt intended the surface
                            political appeal of his proposals to cause the South problems.</p>

                                particularly with the secret North-South political contacts soon to
                                be out in the open. <persName>Kim</persName> probably believes that
                                his tight political control in the North gives him a basic advantage
                                over his rival, beset with political and social tensions always
                                simmering just beneath the surface and much more vulnerable to
                                foreign criticism of authoritarian political methods.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> said he did not consider
                                North Korean acceptance of the proposal for a dialogue an act of
                                sincerity or sign of good intentions by <persName corresp="#p_KIS1"
                                    >Kim Il Sung</persName>. He anticipated there could even be
                                unfavorable things arising during the course of the negotiations,
                                knowing the nature and past record of the North Korean Communists.
                                Agreement in principle in itself does not give the South Koreans
                                reason to trust the North Koreans. On the other hand they are not
                                appearing totally distrustful. They are willing to test North Korean
                                sincerity and good intentions which must be proven by actions in the
                                future. He noted that toward the end of the joint communiqué the
                                observation of the aforementioned principles are pledged before the
                                Korean people by both North and South. It is to be hoped that

                            <item>The reunification of a divided country requires considerable time
                                with perseverance and patience. It is a difficult problem in view of
                                the fact that North and South Korea are at two extremes of ideology
                                and institutions. Neither side will accept the other’s institutions
                                or ideology. They will have to be compromised, and he does not
                                perceive how this would come about at the present time. The
                                important thing was to open a dialogue and to avoid recurrence of
                                war in order to reach the ultimate [goal?] of reunification. There
                                were intermediate steps beginning with an exchange of people, goods
                                and culture so as to improve understanding and eliminate
                                misunderstandings. He does not at present expect the political talks
                                to go into hot discussion on reunification. There will be much time
                                and much to do before that. The North Koreans on the contrary want
                                to get into the hot issues now. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                    >Park</persName> had explained to Park Sang Chol of North Korea
                                that it is not time to go into the difficult political problems. The
                                North Korean approach is far ahead of political realities. For
                                example they proposed summit talks right away, which is impractical.
                                If the atmosphere matures then, of <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373"
                                    facs="0400"/>course, political talks will be possible but this
                                is not the case. There is no mutual confidence after a separation of
                                twenty years. Direct confrontation on political issues now would
                                only lead to charges and counter-charges. No fruitful results would
                                follow and the meetings would end. So it would be better to
                                eliminate the causes of separation and approach the easy problems
                                before the difficult problems. Park Sang Chol said he would report
                                these views to <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il

                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> said that upon
                                announcement of the joint communiqué the general public reaction was
                                to welcome the move. They were simply glad a dialogue had been
                                opened between the North and South. More thoughtful people who
                                understood the problems expressed their welcome but at the same time
                                showed some concern because they know the nature of Communism. In
                                the joint communiqué North Korea has affirmed it would not use force
                                to achieve unification. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>
                                was pleased he had finally gotten North Korea to accept this
                                principle. So long as the dialogue continued he did not expect
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il Sung</persName> would seek to
                                use force. But he does expect the North Koreans to seek something
                                else. The intention of <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il
                                    Sung</persName> is to realize his long-term demand that U.S.
                                forces should withdraw from Korea. This is already demonstrated by
                                the fact Park Sang Chol had stated in a press interview that with
                                the agreement in the joint communiqué there was no need for foreign
                                forces to remain in Korea and that <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1"
                                    >UNCURK</gloss> should be dissolved. These sorts of demands
                                could be expected continuously in the future.</item>

                            <item>Another intention of <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il
                                    Sung</persName> is to use the communiqué to try and influence
                                U.S. public opinion to call for an end of U.S. military aid to South
                                Korea. It was encouraging to learn that the State Department’s
                                spokesman had made it known that U.S. military assistance will be
                                continued and U.S. forces will not be reduced as a result of the
                                latest development. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> said
                                he believes that if uncertainty arises over future U.S. support the
                                South-North talks would either reach deadlock or break off. The
                                South is trying to test the sincerity of the North. To do so it
                                needs continuing U.S. support because without such aid it would not
                                be possible to negotiate from a position of strength with <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Green</persName> said he appreciated
                                President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s lucid,
                                articulate and convincing statement of motivation and prospects. He
                                knew President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> as
                                practical, realistic and tough-minded. He was particularly struck by
                                the comment concerning inhibitions imposed upon the North Koreans.
                                It would become more difficult for them to take provocative actions
                                now that world attention was focussed on them and this was
                                important. He also appreciated the truth of what the President was
                                saying about North Korean objectives. Their objectives were
                                obviously not friendly. As the President said, we distrust them but
                                not to the point where we can’t have a dialogue and a step-by-step
                                approach for a reduction of tensions and a long-run goal of
                                reunification. <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0401"/>We also
                                appreciate the necessity of negotiating from a position of strength
                                as well as the importance of solidarity at home and with friends
                                abroad. The joint communiqué had been welcomed by Korea’s friends.
                                The move into South-North talks and an expanding dialogue has our
                                full support. The United States would do that which is within its
                                capabilities to enable Korea to negotiate from strength. This would
                                not be the kind of strength that would threaten the North but it was
                                the kind that would produce honest negotiations. As with our own
                                negotiations with the Soviet Union we did not believe in unilateral
                                reductions or actions. We believe in reciprocity, so we fully
                                understand the point President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"

                                    on July 6. According to telegram 3939 from Seoul, July 7,
                                        <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Green</persName> told <persName
                                        corresp="#p_LHR1">Lee</persName> that the South Koreans
                                    could “count on the moral and material support of the U.S.
                                    Government and people” in their South-North initiatives.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Lee</persName> said the South
                                    thought “it might be better at first to exchange people,
                                    material, and communications” than to work on the terms of
                                    achieving reunification. <persName corresp="#p_GM1"
                                        >Green</persName> agreed with this and added “that to the
                                    extent exchanges can be achieved it will make it more difficult
                                    for North Koreans to create incidents.” He commented, “There is
                                    no question the South will gain from such exchanges and one can
                                    hope North Korean views will be moderated as they are exposed to
                                    the outside world rather than remain a closed garrison state.”

                                Koreans had already started propaganda demands for immediate U.S.
                                withdrawal and cut in the level of military forces in Korea. To
                                people outside of Korea who did not understand the situation these
                                proposals might sound good. Some might even feel that North Korea
                                was being more positive and South Korea was being quite passive in
                                the steps toward peace. But people who understood the situation knew
                                better. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> hoped that he

                                anything in advance of South Korean proposals. They have a program
                                in mind but they did not wish others to jump ahead in advance of
                                their own views.</item>

                                reason to inerpret the call for independent Korean efforts for
                                reunification as denying U.S. assistance. We do not impose or
                                interfere in other people’s affairs. We have close relations with
                                Korea as we do with many countries in the world.</item>

                                understanding through various actions which would create an
                                atmosphere of mutual confidence. This would be the first half of an
                                effort for Korean reunification. After that would come the political
                                talks. What happens then will be dictated by internal developments
                                and the course of events which are hard to predict.</item>

                            <item>Meanwhile as he had suggested, our friends should refrain from
                                suggesting things that are in advance of their own proposals.
                                Speaking frankly, he said, the reference made by Secretary <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> to the “<gloss
                                    target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss>” of course had no significance of
                                recognition or other political implications. But once the statement
                                had been made the public wondered if the United States was beginning
                                to recognize North Korea. This demonstrated Korean sensitivity to
                                remarks by high-ranking U.S. officials. If someone outside of the
                                government, in the press or in the world of sports, were to make
                                such a statement there would be no significance attached. It is
                                different when a ranking figure is involved. It makes the North
                                Koreans happy and the South Koreans unhappy and he hopes that there
                                is no reason to make North Koreans happy. He asked that we refrain
                                from high official recognition of North Korea.</item>

                                point to make before breaking up. Some scholars and others were
                                claiming that in the long-run South-North talks would lead to dual
                                representation in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>: recognition
                                of two Koreas. This may come sooner or later regardless of other
                                desires but he was hoping to delay that time in order to improve
                                Korea’s position in the world as in the case of East and West
                                Germany. He believes that even some officials in the United States
                                speak in these terms. While it is a practical reality and may come
                                about, it would be better if it were delayed until the <gloss

                                    >Park</persName> said he wanted discussion between the North and

                                the debate there. As for two Koreas he hoped the U.S. Government
                                would recognize the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is the only
                                lawful government on the Korean peninsula and that it will not
                                recognize any other [garble—lawful?] government. After all, the
                                Soviet Union refused to recognize the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> while characterizing the government in North Korea
                                as the only legitimate government. The U.S. Government might say
                                that when agreement is reached between North and South Korea on dual
                                representation only then would the U.S. be able to support such a
                                concept. At present the U.S. should recognize the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> as the only lawful government.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Green</persName> said that he did not
                                see that this would create any issue. The U.S. recognizes the
                                Government of the Republic of Korea alone on the Korean peninsula.
                                As for the postponement of debate on the Korean question at the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> this year, <persName

                                be ample grounds to request postponement. This opinion would be

                            major results of the contacts between the two begun last August. As
                            such, the agreement signifies the interest on both sides in continuing
                            and expanding the contacts, and probably will act as something of an
                            additional deterrent against a return to militancy by North Korea. As
                            you will recall, these contacts were stimulated primarily by your China
                            initiative. They first took the form of discussions between their Red

                            since late March have included secret higher-level, official discussions
                            of political issues.</p>
                        <p>The following are the highlights that emerge from our preliminary
                            analysis of the Communiqué: <list>
                                <item>—The document is largely confined to an enunciation of broad
                                    principles, which is useful as a demonstration of the two sides’
                                    ability to agree on at least some general language. Wide
                                    disagreement in its application to specifics will of course
                                    remain, with both sides trying to exploit its propaganda
                                    value.</item>
                                <item>—The Communiqué’s content shows that the South successfully
                                    resisted the North’s attemps to move immediately to discussion
                                    of basic political issues. (<persName corresp="#p_PCH1"

                                    in line with the “mood of détente,” the North probably has
                                    farther to go on this score. Somewhat paradoxically, Pyongyang’s

                            our current position is of course to support postponement of General
                            Assembly debate on the question for this year.</p>
                        <p>[Early responses to our initial démarches made this past week in a wide
                            range of capitals seeking support for postponement has revealed more
                            support for our current position than was previously anticipated. The
                            majority of these states have justified their intended support in terms
                            of avoiding a great power confrontation and avoiding complicating the
                            promising dialogue now underway between the two Koreas. We would,
                            however, emphasize the early and partial nature of these returns.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, State estimates that we presently appear to have the
                            edge in the General Assembly’s General Committee, which must pass on our
                            postponement proposal and the resolutions before they go to the Plenary.
                            State believes that on postponement, the General Committee at present
                            comes down with 11 for, 6 opposed, 7 uncertain, and the Polish President
                            of the Committee (who votes only in case of a tie). We have additional
                            indications, however, that a General Committee decision to recommend
                            postponement is likely to be challenged by Pyongyang’s supporters in the

                        <p>[There is some reason for skepticism over State’s belief that we are in a

                            necessarily to a critical extent. The most important factor here will
                            probably be the progress made by the two Koreas in their reunification

                        <p>Given our strong adherence to postponement, the central problem is to

                                The South has been willing to do so, given the support and
                                advantaged position the U.N. action has conferred on Seoul. The
                                North has refused to accept U.N. competence, reflecting its

                            resolutions, arguing that the 1953 Korean Armistice leaves the
                            resolutions without practical effect, and that the strategic embargo
                            embodied in the second of the two resolutions no longer exists and is no
                            longer applied under the authority of this resolution. The advantage of
                            this option would be that it avoids bad precedents, while allowing a

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I thought we should
                            have a review of the Korean issue today because it could come up a
                            little later in two ways. The first issue is a procedural one—whether an
                            attempt will be made to put the Korean item on the agenda of the General
                            Assembly and <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0418"/>whether we should
                            try to defer the debate? Second, if we don’t succeed, if we lose the
                            General Assembly vote, what general stance do we take on the other
                            matters: the type of invitation to the two Koreas, <gloss
                                target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Command?</p>
                        <p>The two issues are distinct, but related. If we win on the first one, the
                            procedural issue, the second one becomes less urgent.</p>
                        <p>(to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson) Alex</persName>, do you or
                            Sam (DePalma) want to discuss these issues in more detail?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: I’ll let Sam do that. I just want to
                            say, though, that I think at this moment the postponement approach looks
                            reasonably doable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: I don’t think it’s worth it to describe the issues in long
                            detail, so I will keep my remarks brief. I must also warn you that it is
                            too soon to be confident about our estimates. Right now, we seem to be
                            in good shape in the General Committee. At least we’re in better shape
                            than we were last year, when we were able to defer the debate. In the
                            end, we think the Committee vote will be thirteen for deferment, seven
                            against and four abstentions, provided the present vote trend holds. Our
                            estimate for the General Assembly vote is less solid, but we think there
                            will be a fifteen or twenty vote margin in favor of deferment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I’m trying to
                            understand how this issue will unfold procedurally. Let’s say the
                            General Committee votes for deferment. The issue then goes to the
                            General Assembly. Is that right?</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: Yes. And an appeal against the General Committee’s
                            recommendation will probably be made in the Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: When would that
                            happen?</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: Fairly soon—probably one or two days—after the General
                            Committee votes on the question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And if an appeal
                            were made in the Assembly, there would be a debate on the procedural
                            issue of the types of invitations to be issued? Is that right?</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: There would be general debate on the substantive issues,
                            too.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Would it be an
                            acrimonious debate?</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: I don’t think so. My guess is that everybody would try to
                            take reasonable and moderate positions. I don’t think the debate would
                            heat up very much. We would say, given the evolving situation of the
                            talks, we should leave both Koreas alone and let them try to work out
                            their differences themselves. I think the other side would tend to be
                            compelled to follow the same strategy, too.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You don’t think,
                            then, that there would be a high-powered debate?</p>
                        <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0419"/>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: No, I don’t.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: If the North and
                            South are talking at that time, there probably wouldn’t be a
                            high-powered debate in the Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: I should point out one other thing, though. We’ve never had
                            a situation before where the Chinese and the Soviets are out trying to
                            do something together. We know the Chinese position, but the Soviets
                            have not shown their hand yet, although they have talked about
                            supporting the Chinese. We should take into account the fact that they
                            may work in concert on this issue.</p>
                        <p>Also, as <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alex</persName> just said, we will
                            be in a better position if the talks are going again.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: They started again
                            today.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: Good. If they are suspended when the Assembly considers the
                            matter, the North could say the talks won’t resume again until the
                            Assembly takes affirmative action from the North’s point of view.</p>
                        <p>Since both sides have not yet hit most governments at high levels on this
                            entire question, we don’t know for sure how the governments will vote.
                            Nor do we know how the governments will react in the face of strong
                            pressures from one side or the other. Therefore, there is some
                            uneasiness about our estimates, which are based on low-level
                            contacts.</p>
                        <p>If we decide not to do any arm-twisting for votes, the final outcome may
                            depend to some degree on how hard the other side fights. I think the
                            Chinese will fight hard, but it won’t be an all-out effort.</p>
                        <p>As I say, there is some uneasiness with our estimates. Still, I think we
                            ought to be able to get the deferment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If we win in the
                            General Committee but lose in the General Assembly, will the issue then
                            be referred to the First Committee?</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: Yes, unless the Committee recommends it be referred directly
                            to the Plenary—and the Plenary accepts this recommendation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If that were done,
                            it would avoid the invitation question, right?</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: Yes. And I think we should give some consideration to this
                            approach.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Assuming the issue
                            is referred to the First Committee, when would the Committee take it up?
                            About six weeks after the General Committee and Plenary’s action?</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: Yes, although it could be taken up four weeks after the
                            General Committee’s action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That would be at
                            the end of the election campaign.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: I would say on the eve of the election.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: Could we stretch it
                            out so that the First Committee doesn’t take it up until after the
                            election?</p>
                        <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0420"/>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: Yes, I think that would be fairly easy to do.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Even if it came up
                            before the election, I think our domestic opponents would be hurt more
                            by an adverse outcome than we would be. Nevertheless, it’s not good to
                            have another <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> uproar.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: Can we try to stretch
                            the procedure out so that the First Committee doesn’t take up the
                            question until after the election?</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: Yes. Even the other side is not interested in forcing this
                            issue to come up on the eve of the election. If that were the case, they
                            know we would be forced into taking a stiffer position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay. Our objective
                            should be to put the debate off until after the election if we lose in
                            the General Committee or in the General Assembly. That will also enable
                            us to be more flexible on the concrete issues, and it will give us more
                            time to consider our positions on those issues.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>: When does the General
                            Assembly convene?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: On the 16th, I
                            think.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: No. It convenes on the 19th. Our position looks fairly good,
                            but it is not solid, and we shouldn’t assume that it is solid.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand.
                            You’re saying things look quite good right now. However, we haven’t yet
                            seen the impact of a concerted Chinese and Soviet campaign. And we
                            haven’t obtained the high-level views of most governments. That’s all we
                            can say at the moment.</p>
                        <p>If the Assembly convenes on the 19th, when will the General Committee be
                            seized with the question?</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: The 19th is a Tuesday. I think the issue should be brought
                            up at the end of that week—or possibly on the following Monday.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Then it won’t be
                            stretching things too far to go until November.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: No. We have a reasonable chance of doing that.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: While this group is
                            here, we might say a few words about the substantive issues, but we will
                            consider them in more detail later on. We won’t have to take positions
                            on these substantive issues until we know the outcome of the debate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: I agree. And I don’t
                            think we should talk about contingency plans before the debate because
                            it will make the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s nervous.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: Is that a blanket instruction, or can we talk to the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s and two or three others?</p>
                        <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0421"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: Unless there is an
                            overriding necessity to talk about contingency plans, I think we would
                            be better off not to do so.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree with
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alex</persName>. Also, if we lose, the
                            Koreans could then say that we meant to lose all along.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: That’s right.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: But our figures are very queasy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Once the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s know there will be a debate, there
                            will be no way for them to avoid giving us their positions. In the
                            meantime, we can have preliminary talks within the government here. (to
                            Mr. DePalma) When will the invitation question come up?</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: That depends on the First Committee’s order of business.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Could it be within
                            the first four to six weeks?</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: If the invitation question is the first item on the agenda,
                            it will probably come up within five or six weeks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If the General
                            Committee or General Assembly votes against us, we won’t have to decide
                            right away about the invitation question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: The problem is that if the vote goes against us, the other
                            side could call for an urgent meeting of the First Committee. But even
                            if that were done, it would still take a couple of weeks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And we would insist
                            on following the normal time schedule.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: Yes, although there is always the possibility that the other
                            side may get the bit in its teeth and try to capitalize on the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don’t think the
                            Chinese and the Soviets are that eager to humiliate us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: Neither do I. This
                            issue is not all that important, anyway.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: First, we should
                            try to defer the debate. If we lose, though, we should try to put it off
                            until after the election. Let’s talk briefly about the substantive
                            issues. The first one is the invitation question. The State paper gives
                            several options,<note n="3" xml:id="d153fn3">See <ref target="#d152fn2"
                                    >Document 152 and footnote 2</ref> thereto.</note> the first of
                            which is the conditional resolution, the one we have always succeeded
                            with in the past.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: I don’t think we can
                            get any more mileage out of it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Option 2 is a
                            slight alteration of Option 1, eliminating reference to the fact that
                            the <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> refuses to acknowledge <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0422"/>competence on the Korean
                            question. The text is at Annex C–3 of the paper. By the way, whoever
                            wrote the paper did a good job. Although this resolution—which was
                            proposed by New Zealand last year—doesn’t mention the condition, it has
                            it. If Option 1 won’t go, Option 2 won’t go.</p>
                        <p>Option 3 is another modification. The two Koreas would not have to accept
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> jurisdiction, but only accept the
                            principles of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: That’s right.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: I think Option 3 would probably work. Whenever the North
                            Koreans turned down the resolutions in the past, they always said they
                            accepted the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter principles.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Everyone will get a
                            crack at these options later on. Right now, though, I’m just trying to
                            get the sentiment of the people around this table. Is anyone violently
                            uncomfortable with this approach?</p>
                        <p>(No objections were raised)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me leave out
                            the word “violently.” Is anyone uncomfortable with this approach?</p>
                        <p>(Again, no objections were raised)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Okay. let’s
                            tentatively think about it. The second substantive issue is <gloss
                                target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss>, and the third is the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command and troop withdrawal. (to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson) Alex</persName>, where do we
                            stand on <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> and what are our
                            choices?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1"
                                >UNCURK</gloss> really has no value to us or to the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You will be
                            interested to know that the first time I met <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName>, he went on and on about <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1"
                                >UNCURK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>: It’s not exactly a
                            household word.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: Although it is of no
                            real value any more, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s will be
                            sorry to see it go. As a first fallback position, we could insist that
                            the North and South continue to talk, and we would not even mention
                                <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We couldn’t get
                            away with that.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: You’re probably
                            right. As a second fallback position, then, we could ask <gloss
                                target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> to review itself and to report
                            back to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> next year. That would at
                            least give us another year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You mean we should
                            ask the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to ask <gloss
                                target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> to review itself?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: Yes, and to report back to the Assembly
                            next year. A third fallback position would be to terminate <gloss
                                target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss>. And still another variant
                            position would be to use a study committee to review the importance of
                                <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> and to make
                            recommendations to the General Assembly next year. This is only an
                            important issue because the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s feel
                                <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> strengthens their hand in
                            talking with Pyongyang. We don’t want to appear to be abandoning the

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The choices you’ve
                            presented are really modalities for abandoning <gloss
                                target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: That’s right. It
                            would be done slowly, but not over a prolonged period of time. And we
                            would give <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> a decent
                            burial.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I heard that the
                            Chinese were going to propose suspending <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1"
                                >UNCURK</gloss>’s activities. Is that true?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJH1">Holdridge</persName>: That was a CAS
                            report. It said the Chinese may use the word “suspend” instead of
                            “terminate” in their resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: They would be smart to do so. In any case, <gloss
                                target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> wouldn’t be able to be
                            revived.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RDL1">Ranard</persName>: Whatever word they
                            use, it would stop all of <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss>’s
                            activities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: That’s right. The Chinese would be better off using the word
                            “suspend,” but I don’t know if they are that smart. Incidentally, the
                            ghost of <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> is fast fading, as it
                            is. The Chileans are out. And even though the Pakistanis are still in,
                            they are feeling the heat from the Chinese. <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1"
                                >UNCURK</gloss> may be visibly disintegrating before our eyes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Who is in it?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RDL1">Ranard</persName>: There used to be seven
                            countries, but now there are only six: Australia, Thailand, Turkey, the
                            Philippines, the Netherlands and Pakistan. Chile used to be the seventh
                            country.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: If Pakistan withdraws from <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1"
                                >UNCURK</gloss>, it will provide further evidence of a crumbling
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: (to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RDL1">Ranard) Don</persName>, do you want to add
                            anything?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RDL1">Ranard</persName>: If we are able to
                            defer the <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> issue this year, it
                            might give the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s the initiative to do
                            something about <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> themselves.
                            They know the <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> issue is a
                            sticky wicket, and they know this is probably the last time we will be
                            able to defer the issue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What will the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> position be if the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> disbands <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1"
                                >UNCURK</gloss>? Will the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s be
                            demoralized?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RDL1">Ranard</persName>: Yes. Since 1947,<gloss
                                target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> has been the symbol of the
                            legitimacy of their government and the affirmation of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role in Korea. If it is abandoned now,
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s will be demoralized. In
                            addition, there will probably be some internal political problems,
                            especially between the head of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            and the Prime Minister, who are rivals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: But it would not destroy the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RDL1">Ranard</persName>: No, it wouldn’t.</p>
                        <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0424"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You say the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s could get rid of <gloss
                                target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> themselves during the coming
                            year. But wouldn’t that have the same impact as the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> suspending <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1"
                                >UNCURK</gloss>’s activities?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: No, because the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s would be taking the action, not
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Don’t forget, either, that
                                UNCOK—<gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss>’s predecessor—was an
                            important factor in getting <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> support
                            for our actions in Korea in 1950. Their witness about the attack from
                            the North—aside from the Soviet absence—enabled the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to support our actions. The <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s remember that, and they feel <gloss
                                target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> gives them some security.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Solomon: One report we’ve seen says the North wants a voice in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in order to have some protection
                            from a “great power” deal on the Peninsula.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RDL1">Ranard</persName>: That report, I think,
                            is just a sophisticated argument to get the issue to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Can we lose on the
                                <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> issue?</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: If we lose on deferring the debate, we can also lose on
                                <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What about the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command issue?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: That comes under the
                            Security Council, not the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In other words, we
                            have a veto on that issue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: Yes. If the General
                            Assembly passes a resolution about the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Command, the resolution will have no legal effect. We could ignore if it
                            we want to.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: How could the
                            Security Council take action on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Command?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: It would have to pass
                            a resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Which we could
                            veto.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RDL1">Ranard</persName>: There are less than
                            two hundred foreign troops in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Command, aside from our own forces. Would we use the veto when it might
                            have an effect on foreign troop participation in the Command?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command is significant because it
                            legitimizes our operations. We don’t need the two hundred foreign troops
                            in the Command.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Doolin: It also helps preserve the U.S. Status of Forces
                            Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: Can we get the Thai to stick with us? They have one plane in
                            Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Do we really care
                            about the Thai in Korea?</p>
                        <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0425"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: When I first went out
                            to Thailand, one of my main jobs was to try to persuade the Thai to keep
                            their plane in Korea. Here it is 1972, and we’re still talking about the
                            same plane.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Is it our desire to
                            keep foreign troops in Korea? I suppose the answer is “yes” as long as
                            there is a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command. However, if we
                            lose the Thai plane and the other foreign forces, do we want to make
                            some changes in the command? As long as the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Command can’t be disbanded by the General Assembly, our
                            position is not bad. Whatever changes the other side wants to make we
                            will control. Is that correct?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What is the
                            relationship of the U.S. Status of Forces Agreement in Japan with the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command in Korea? What changes
                            would we have to make in the Status of Forces Agreement in Japan if we
                            give up the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: The Status of Forces
                            Agreement with Japan permits the stationing of non-American troops in
                            Japan for the defense of Korea. This has nothing to do with the U.S.
                            forces stationed in Japan, which would not be affected by a disbanding
                            of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command. On the other hand, the
                            relationship of our forces in Korea with the Koreans would be affected
                            by a change in the command.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command were disbanded, it would have no
                            effect on our forces in Japan?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>: That’s right. Our forces in Japan are
                            covered by the Security Agreement with the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Doolin: But the Security Agreement with the Japanese also allows us
                            to use our forces there in the defense of Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If we took a softer
                            position on <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> in the General
                            Assembly, we would not prejudice the survival of the <gloss

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>: No, we wouldn’t.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Could we get an
                            analysis by the end of September of these issues, when we will look at
                            them again in more detail?</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What about the

                            General Assembly to repeal the aggressor resolutions of 1951? Could that
                            be done?</p>
                        <p>Mr. DePalma: I doubt they could get up a head of steam for that. Everyone
                            would be in a bind. They have alluded to it, to be sure, but they’ve
                            never brought it up.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RDL1">Ranard</persName>: When the Chinese first
                            came to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, they said they had three
                            objectives with regard to Korea: 1) to support <persName

                            repeal the aggressor resolutions. They have worked on the first two, but
                            they have never done anything about the third.<note n="4"

                                >ROK</gloss>s would like us to add our weight to the view that Japan
                            should move cautiously in its contacts with Pyongyang, perhaps
                            coordinating its actions with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>,
                            or at least keeping them fully informed of their anticipated moves.</p>
                        <p>We are not sure whether <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName> is
                            exaggerating for effect, or whether he has a different understanding of
                            the pace at which Japan plans to expand its relations with North Korea.
                            The Tanaka Government has made quite clear in the past month that it
                            intends to proceed fairly slowly and cautiously in developing relations
                            with Pyongyang. While, for example, it plans to expand cultural,
                            academic, sports, and technical exchanges with the <gloss
                                target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss>, it will not allow political
                            exchanges. And even as regards technical exchanges, it will not admit
                            North Korean technicians in connection with projects that might involve
                            Japanese Exim Bank financing. The prospects for any rapid expansion of
                            trade <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0428"/>are small, constrained by
                            the North Korean inability to finance it at this point. Equally
                            important, the Tanaka Government has made clear it does not intend any
                            substantial departures in its bilateral relations with Seoul.</p>

                                Minister Kakuei Tanaka met for wide-ranging summit talks on

                                talks with North Korea, but it would be premature for us to talk to
                                North Korea.” He added that “the security of the <gloss

                                the security of Japan.” Tanaka responded that “this reflected a
                                correct understanding of both Koreas.” He seconded <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>’s belief that the development
                                of talks between North and South Korea would not “reduce tensions as
                                much as anticipated.” Tanaka seemingly acquiesced to a role of
                                following South Korea’s lead when he stated, “Japan also is watching
                                developments carefully in terms of working out its own contacts with
                                North Korea gradually, in humanitarian and academic exchanges.”

                                from Saigon, August 30, attached but not printed.</note> that the
                            retention of one <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Division in MR–2
                            appears a necessity through <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> ‘73 and
                            possibly even <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘74. They claim that
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> will not be able to develop
                            the divisional size force necessary to replace the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops in MR–2 and that despite its new
                            battalion upgrade program, the Regional Forces are not expected to
                            assume the security mission in this area during <gloss target="#t_CY1"
                                >CY</gloss> ‘73. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> recently
                            has expressed its desire to the Korean government that it agree to
                            schedule one <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Division beginning
                            withdrawal in July 1973 and a second Division for withdrawal beginning
                            in January 1974. (The Korean government replied on September 4 that its
                            remaining forces will begin withdrawal in January 1973.)</p>
                        <p>Concerning logistical support, <persName corresp="#p_BE1"
                                >Bunker</persName> and Weyand note that transfer of additional

                            would neither be desirable for the Vietnamese nor acceptable to the
                            Koreans. They conclude, however, that expanding current <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> support capability to the point of
                            relative self-sufficiency would be both feasible and probably acceptable
                            to the Koreans. The Embassy–<gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            message does not provide estimates on the extent of the expansion which
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s would consider acceptable for
                            self-sufficiency.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPC1">Habib</persName> in Seoul has

                                >ROK</gloss> army units to remain in South Vietnam beyond their

                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> request to retain <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces in Vietnam through <gloss
                                target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> ‘73 will face strong resistance from both
                            opposition and ruling parties. Many Koreans reportedly find it difficult
                            to justify <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troop levels higher than
                            the U.S., which would not necessarily be the case if the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s keep one Division and we don’t go
                            below the currently planned 27,000 figure until there is a settlement.
                            They also resent inadequate levels of consultation on our negotiations
                            and view continued troop presence as a major handicap to broader
                            contacts with non-aligned countries and “non-hostile” Communist
                            nations.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPC1">Habib</persName> nevertheless
                            believes that we might prevail on President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> if President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> made a direct approach for retention of Korean
                            troops in Vietnam. Our approach probably would have to include the
                            following specific inducements: unequivocal U.S. assurances of logistic
                            support; retention of all U.S. titled equipment in <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> hands; equipment to activate two army
                            assault helicopter companies and for each division, one tank company;
                            continuation of net additional cost payments at current rates and
                            agreement to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> requests for severance
                            payments and retirement fund contributions. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_HPC1">Habib</persName> also warned that we need to
                            obtain Korean agreement within the next month or so to keep open the

                            in South Vietnam.</p>

                            cable, the Korean Foreign Minister delivered to our Chargé a copy of an

                            Minister stated that it would be “impossible” for Korean troops to
                            remain through 1973 but noted that, in his personal opinion, some delay
                            within the one year schedule could be made “if the U.S. were in a
                            difficult military situation at that time.”</p>
                        <p>The Korean Desk officer at the State Department has advised us that
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPC1">Habib</persName>’s estimate of
                            Korean demands probably are excessive; he believes that the Koreans may
                            settle for less. We are inclined to agree and view the Korean
                            aide-mémoire to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> as a bargaining
                            tactic to strengthen their position in our forthcoming consultations on
                            further <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> withdrawals.</p>
                        <p>This judgement appears corroborated by a recent [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line not declassified</hi>] report [<hi rend="italic">1 line
                                not declassified</hi>] that the Foreign Ministry is the only element
                            of the Korean government that desires a complete <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> force withdrawal. The Economic Ministry, the President
                            and the military reportedly have ambivalent feelings on withdrawal with
                            the Army favoring continued commitment. The impression of flexibility is
                            further indicated by the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line not
                                declassified</hi>] prediction that the Koreans would bargain over
                            terms for a continued <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> presence at
                            the U.S.-Korean discussions scheduled for late November. The Koreans
                            reportedly will use their plans to withdraw the Capital Division in
                            early <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> ‘73 as a ploy to obtain firm
                            U.S. commitments either for continued U.S. direct combat and service
                            support or for the addition of new tank and helicopter units to their

                                >GVN</gloss> through <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1973 has

                                >Phil</persName> says that he believes that with the right kind of

                                >Park</persName> to get one Division through 1973 and into 1974 but
                            he is sure that <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> will insist
                            on drawing down at least one. The same old problems exist with regard to

                            been the most serious shortcoming with our relations with Korea. He
                            feels that we are going to sell <persName corresp="#p_NVT1"
                                >Thieu</persName> out and that he will be left holding the bag on
                            troops in Vietnam. I told <persName corresp="#p_HPC1">Phil</persName> to
                            tell <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> that he had talked to
                            you and to reassure him that we had not come this far to sell out now,
                            to make sure that negotiations are underway and that we are coordinating
                            carefully with <persName corresp="#p_NVT1">Thieu</persName> and to also
                            underline the President’s determination and resolve to include a
                            determination to bring the war to a conclusion either through
                            negotiations or otherwise in the most strenuous way, especially after
                            the election.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Korean troop levels, we will have the bureaucracy’s
                            recommendations in about a week. I think our best bet is to play for
                            time so that we have the troop levels high if we are forced to enter
                            into a stepped up military phase after the elections. This kind of thing
                            I think <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> will understand and
                            support if we consult with him at the time. There will, of course, be
                            the usual payola.<note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">On November 1, <persName

                        <p>There are two <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> infantry divisions in
                            Viet-Nam. The Government of Viet-Nam has asked the Republic of Korea
                            Government to maintain two full divisions until June 1973, and not to
                            begin the withdrawal of the second of the two until the beginning of
                                <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1974. The <gloss target="#t_ROKG1"
                                >ROKG</gloss> has replied that it intends to begin withdrawing its
                            forces “from the beginning of 1973” and it is our understanding that the
                            withdrawal is to be completed by June 30, 1973. The <gloss
                                target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> has told us privately that there is
                            some room for negotiation on the time-table if this would accommodate
                            the United States, but it wanted the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            to understand that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces could not
                            stay until the end of <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1973. Although
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> insists on negotiations with
                            the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> on any retention of its forces in
                            Viet-Nam, it is to our interest to keep intact the bilateral <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> commitment to Viet-Nam and to maintain
                            the position that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is in a
                            supporting role to any <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>/<gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> negotiations.</p>
                        <p>We believe the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> is firm in wanting
                            to withdraw at least one division in <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>
                            1973 and at the outside might be willing to retain some smaller force
                            until early <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1974. Within these limits

                        <p>The Korean troops in Viet-Nam are performing a useful role and the <gloss

                            1973. At the same time, the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> finds
                            little reason to retain two full divisions in Viet-Nam in view of the

                            withdrawals to ensure the presence of one division through as much of
                                <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1973 as possible.</p>
                        <p>Consideration has been given to the continued support of <gloss

                            logistic support, they are and will be unable to provide helicopter

                            air support. Moreover, within the periods envisaged, the <gloss

                            self-sufficiency in these areas. The only alternative is continued

                            has been weighed against the impact on the security of remaining <gloss

                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces, it will be necessary to
                            retain additional <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> personnel
                            specifically for this purpose when the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            force level goes below 25,000. (The details of <gloss target="#t_US1"

                        <p>This review of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces in Viet-Nam is
                            based on the assumption that we will not achieve a negotiated peace
                            prior to the end of the dry season 1973. If negotiations succeed, the
                            alternatives discussed in this paper will no longer be applicable. If
                            peace or a cease-fire along the lines of your May 8, 1972 proposal is
                            established, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces in Viet-Nam
                            should be withdrawn along with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            forces in four months. The other side will demand it, and it is doubtful
                            that the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> could be induced to keep
                            troops in Viet-Nam once we have withdrawn all <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> forces.</p>
                        <p>Alternative 3, retention of one division through the critical 1973 dry
                            season period would substantially meet <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> security requirements and probably would provide some
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military presence through most
                            of the remainder of <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1973. It would be
                            consistent with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> aims of completing
                            the redeployment of its forces by the end of <gloss target="#t_CY1"

                        <p>A Status Report on Contacts Between North and South Korea</p>
                        <p>It has been just slightly more than a year since the Government of the
                            Republic of Korea had its Red Cross Society call publicly for talks with
                            its Northern counterpart on divided families. This relatively brief
                            period has seen considerable progress. Presently there are active
                            North-South contacts at two levels—the public Red Cross discussions and
                            secret meetings at Panmunjom between trusted representatives of <gloss

                        <p>The first two plenary sessions of the Red Cross talks just completed in
                            Pyongyang and Seoul indicate that there is little chance for rapid
                            progress toward reuniting divided families. But the travel of the two
                            delegations to their rivals’ capitals was a momentous first step for
                            each toward understanding the society of the other. Both seemed to have
                            been impressed and surprised at the experience. The Southern delegates
                            were surprised by the totality of discipline and control by the Northern
                            leadership over its people. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            government was immensely pleased and probably somewhat surprised at the
                            spontaneously hostile reaction of its own press and public to the
                            Northerners’ propaganda-loaded speeches. The North was taken aback by
                            the vehement Southern reaction to these speeches, although undoubtedly
                            believing the whole thing had been staged by the Seoul government. The
                            sessions were more ceremonial than substantive, with no agreement
                            reached beyond the time and place for two more sessions—October 24 in
                            Pyongyang and November 27 in Seoul.</p>
                        <p>Both Northern and Southern leaders seem to feel the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> benefited most from the first round.
                            Pyongyang feels the South broke its agreement that neither side would
                            criticize the other, by allowing vociferous press criticism of the
                            Northern speeches and has responded by publishing scathing accounts by
                            North Korean journalists who visited Seoul, describing their experience
                            of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> society as revolting and
                            disgusting. In addition, Pyongyang was clearly stung by its decisive
                            defeat in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, made particularly
                            galling by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> use of the North-South
                            talks to win support for its postponement position. Pyongyang has
                            responded by leveling the sharpest propaganda attacks since the July
                            fourth agreement at the South Korean leadership, accusing President
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> by name of perfidy and
                            bad faith. The attacks have stopped short of threatening to end the
                            talks, however. Apparently <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il
                                Sung</persName> sees this verbal offensive as a means of focusing
                            blame for his <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> defeat and embarrassment
                            of his delegation in Seoul on Southern treachery. Moreover, the attacks
                            probably please the hawks in his inner circle while reminding the
                            Northern population that despite the talks there is still an
                            unscrupulous enemy to the south. Additionally <persName>Kim</persName>
                            certainly views the attacks as a means of pressuring the South to
                            concede to Northern demands for politicization of the talks.</p>

                            unlikely. Though neither side seems ready to move rapidly at this point,
                            neither will want the blame for ending contacts. Both seem to see the

                                they should not hesitate. They should adapt themselves to cold
                                reality and, as necessary, supplement discrepancies in the existing
                                constitution and correct unreasonable aspects of their system. Thus

                            <item>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KJP1">Kim</persName> said
                                that within ten days, i.e. October 27, a constitutional amendment
                                will be announced and offered in a national referendum on or about
                                November 17. Provided the national referendum is approved, one month
                                later, on or about December 17, a presidential election will be
                                held. This election will be conducted by an electoral group, which
                                will be known as a National Conference for Unification. In other
                                words there would first be an election for electors <pb n="413"
                                    xml:id="pg_413" facs="0440"/>and they in turn will elect the
                                President. Therefore the presidential election will be completed
                                before Christmas and the constitutional functions normalized before
                                the end of the year, that is to say an amended constitution will be
                                in place. Under this amended constitution a new National Assembly
                                will be elected within six months from the date the national
                                referendum is held and the amendments approved.</item>

                            <item>The Prime Minister said that martial law is being proclaimed in
                                order to prevent the disorder and chaos that may arise as a result
                                of the measures that are planned. The constitutional amendments to
                                be presented are still under study but certain general ideas are
                                being followed. In their view the essence of an open society is to
                                have elections but an electoral system is a vulnerable point
                                particularly in a country like Korea where repeated elections
                                increase the vulnerability of the society. To remedy this, it is
                                agreed that the tenure of the President and the National Assembly
                                should be extended. Therefore they will be elected for a period of
                                six years and for no more than two terms. In the past presidential
                                elections have resulted in a great deal of waste, disorder and
                                confusion, the Prime Minister said. So they have reached the
                                conclusion that it is better to have indirect elections in place of
                                direct elections.</item>

                                group with one elector to come from each myon, dong and eup.<note

                                This would mean about 3,500 electors. This figure is not firm. They
                                consider the ideal number to be somewhere between 3,000 and 5,000
                                persons. At this point I asked if electors would be chosen
                                regardless of population. The Prime Minister replied that this
                                matter was still under study. It was generally favored to do it by
                                administrative unit but some thought was being given to taking
                                population into consideration.</item>

                                representation in the Assembly. By this process, the Prime Minister
                                went on, the President will be provided with a stable majority in
                                the National Assembly. In the past, to obtain a stable majority in
                                the National Assembly, the government has had to resort to various
                                undesirable methods. Now, whoever is elected President will have a
                                stable majority. This will eliminate the irregularities that have so
                                often taken place in order to get a majority in the Assembly, he
                                added.</item>

                                non-confidence in the Cabinet. The Assembly sessions will be limited
                                to not more than 150 days a year. A regular session of three months
                                and not more than two extraordinary sessions of thirty days each.
                                However, the President can call a special session whenever he
                                pleases, as necessary. Moreover, provisions would be made for
                                “important issues” to be referred to a national referendum instead
                                of as present permitting only constitutional changes to be referred

                                legislative and executive bodies. He said the primary purpose of
                                this reformation was to reorganize the government in order to enable
                                it to carry out “future changes” with “versatility”. During the
                                period before a new National Assembly takes office, necessary
                                legislative action will be taken by the Cabinet.</item>

                                troops would be under the Capital Security Command. They will remain

                                thorough studies are still in process as to details on these actions
                                and he will keep me informed as necessary. The Prime Minister ended
                                by saying he looks to us for our understanding. Through this reform
                                his government hopes to cope with the rapidly changing situation
                                around them and to cope with the dialogue with the North. Finally he
                                said that the meetings with the North will go on as scheduled. He
                                asked me if I had any questions. I replied it appeared that the
                                Prime Minister was informing me of the government’s decision and not
                                asking me for our reaction or opinion. He nodded. I said I had a few
                                questions to ask.</item>

                            <item>When he spoke of maintaining a stable situation, did this mean
                                that he thought they did not have a stable situation at present? He
                                replied a stable situation existed but there is always the danger it
                                will be undermined and the government wishes to be prepared for such
                                a chance for some time to come. I asked where the danger he spoke of
                                comes from? He said internally and externally. Internally through
                                the weakness of the present electoral system as he had pointed out
                                above. Externally, through developments surrounding them, such as
                                dealings between big powers which affect them and over which they
                                have no control. And also in order to cope with the North.</item>

                            <item>I noted his statement that political activity would be prohibited
                                after martial law, does this mean there would be no political
                                activities permitted prior to referendum? He said that was correct
                                and that as soon as the constitutional amendment is approved then
                                political activities will be allowed in time for the National
                                Assembly elections. I asked if political activity would be permitted
                                for the elections of the National Conference for Unification. He
                                said political activity by political parties would not be permitted.
                                At this point, without reference to anything else, the Prime
                                Minister said if the national referendum is rejected by the public
                                it will be taken as a sign that the people did not want the
                                government to continue the dialogue with the North and “measures
                                will be taken”. Thus martial law would continue.</item>

                            <item>I said then there would be no political discussion of the
                                referendum permitted. Not by political parties he replied. However,
                                the amendment will be explained to the people who will then be
                                permitted to decide yes or no. They felt the people had enough
                                knowledge, so the government will explain it as it is and let the
                                people decide. I asked if anyone would be able to campaign or
                                explain a position contrary to the amendment, in other words would
                                anyone else be allowed to solicit no votes. He said this would not
                                be possible. Neither the opposition party nor the government party
                                would be able to conduct political activity. Only facts will be
                                given to the people and they can then decide.</item>

                            <item>I asked how presidential candidates would be presented to the
                                National Conference for Unification. He said this had not been
                                decided finally. Whether the conference will choose the President on
                                its own or let the people present themselves as candidates to the
                                electoral body was still under study. I asked him what he expected
                                the reaction in the country would be. He said the immediate reaction
                                would be “shock.” There might be some disturbances but he is certain
                                the stituation will return to normal and the referendum conducted in
                                good order.</item>

                                then be better understood. These measures were designed to assure
                                the Koreans a strong and effective system for their own survival.
                                International understanding would be enhanced as the Korean people
                                showed their understanding and cooperated with the

                                constitution. He said they intended to amend certain parts of the
                                constitution but leave the rest unchanged. I noted the present
                                constitution does not provide for the process he had outlined. He
                                said this was true and certain measures would have to be taken
                                outside the constitution. I told him this was a very fundamental
                                step and I was not going to give him an off-hand reaction. I would
                                inform Washington immediately. His government had obviously decided
                                to go ahead with these actions. If Washington had any opinion or
                                reaction insofar as these actions affected us, I would be in touch
                                with him. Nevertheless he could expect there will be considerable
                                public comment and the actions taken certainly would have an effect
                                on what people think and do in regard to Korea. I said these were
                                very serious steps being taken by his government and just as he had
                                expressed to me the opinion they would be received with some shock
                                internally, I expected they would also be something of a shock
                                internationally. He replied they expected this but hoped people
                                would understand.</item>

                                        >Kim</persName> to inform his government that we cannot

                                    and in particular cannot understand the attack on U.S. policy in
                                    Asia contained in the proposed presidential proclamation.
                                    Secretary read from text of proclamation and commented it called
                                    into question the wisdom and morality of U.S. policy and
                                    suggested that U.S. actions would adversely affect <gloss

                                    law was erroneous and that its attack on U.S. policy would
                                    create dismay in U.S., Asia and elsewhere. It would be
                                    interpreted as an attack on U.S. policy by an old and trusted

                                an attempt to perpetuate himself in power beyond 1975—though this is
                                probably a major reason. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>

                                respect, his action parallels that of Philippine President Marcos,

                                government in Korea, he said that he was not a politician, that he
                                was conveying the instructions of his government, and that he had
                                done his best to ameliorate the government’s decision.</item>

                                the changes, remained unsatisfactory and that he could only
                                interpret it—and the President would so interpret it—as a direct
                                criticism of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy in Asia. He
                                said he was shocked by the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
                                decision and that he and all those in the <gloss target="#t_US1"

                                he was apprehensive over the future <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422"

                                be asked about what practical difference there now was between the
                                governments in the South and the North. He added that Korea had been
                                an example of representative government in Asia. The steps the
                                government took in implementing its decisions would be important. He
                                hoped the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> would reexamine its
                                present plans. He reminded <persName>Kim</persName> that President
                                Rhee had tightened controls on the Korean people until there had
                                been an explosion and he was fearful that history was repeating

                                counter to the position the Korean Government itself had

                            The new constitution will establish <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> at the head of a much more authoritarian system
                            which will lack the institutional checks and balances of the one it will

                                    impractical, he says, since it would require drastic U.S.
                                    sanctions in order to succeed, and might result in either
                                    destroying <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> or making

                                        >Habib</persName> is also inclined against this, both
                                    because the time remaining before October 27 is insufficient and
                                    because in so doing we would share the responsibility for

                                        >Habib</persName> prefers this, and would do so by a public
                                    announcement commenting on <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                        >Park</persName>’s new constitution when he makes it public.
                                    We would not involve ourselves in any of the reorganization,
                                    except to protest any flagrant personal repression. Implicit in
                                    this course, <persName corresp="#p_HPC1">Habib</persName> notes,
                                    is our recognition that we can no longer try to determine the
                                    course of South Korea’s internal political development. It would
                                    also involve an acceleration of our disengagement from South
                                    Korea.</item>

                        <p>Our own initial comment on Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPC1"
                                >Habib</persName>’s recommendations is to question the extent of
                            disassociation which he advocates. Given our strong strategic interests
                            in the Korean Peninsula, we continue to have a derivative interest in a
                            minimum cohesion within South Korea. While we regret the character of
                                <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s reorganization and
                            believe it unnecessary, his new system is not inevitably de-stabilizing.
                            Our inclination therefore is to focus on how he administers it to see
                            that he does not in the longer term defeat his own objective of
                            increased internal cohesion, and in the process encourage the North to
                            renew its militancy toward the South.</p>

                                rend="italic">Summary:</hi> There is no doubt that constitutional
                            changes will be approved in the Nov 21 referendum. The government is
                            engaged in a massive campaign to present and gild its case. Extensive
                            support for President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> and
                            the constitutional changes is expected from rural areas and other
                            quarters but there is also substantial opposition both to the changes
                            and to President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s retention
                            of power. Under conditions of martial law we have no reliable measure of
                            the extent of approval or disapproval. The government has displayed its
                            readiness to use repressive measures and the outlines of the more
                            authoritarian state which is in prospect are already clear. Whether the
                            government will become more repressive depends mainly upon the extent of
                            dissent or active opposition. The government appears confident that it
                            will survive the successive tests of its public acceptability as it
                            moves through each step of the government changes to come in the next
                            three months. <hi rend="italic">End summary</hi>.</p>

                                in the mind of any observer that the constitutional changes will be
                                approved. Most Koreans accept moreover that the government would be
                                willing to alter the returns if necessary to assure that
                                result.</item>

                            <item>In the last days before the vote, meanwhile, the government is
                                engaging in an all-out campaign on behalf of the changes, setting
                                aside any pretense of confining discussion to “explanations” or of
                                observing its own ban on public argument for or against the changes.
                                The campaign involves massive use of the media to present and gild
                                the government’s case, employment of “enlightenment teams”
                                throughout the country, endorsements and appeals on behalf of the
                                changes by leading figures in all fields of endeavor, and mandatory
                                letter writing by government officials to friends and

                            <item>Under conditions of martial law, press control, and an evident
                                reluctance of many Koreans to discuss the question, it is not
                                possible to know the true extent of public approval or opposition.
                                President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> probably
                                continues to have heavy and largely unquestioning support in rural
                                areas where roughly half of the electorate resides. Others, <pb
                                    n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0453"/>including some
                                intellectuals, share the President’s view regarding the
                                imperfections of political parties and the National Assembly, and
                                use this to rationalize that there is something good in changes
                                which are in any event inevitable.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>It is clear, however, that there is substantial opposition both to
                                the contitutional changes and to President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s retention of power. A
                                growing number of Koreans are privately expressing reservations or
                                outright opposition. These include not only intellectuals, members
                                of the press, some members and followers of the opposition <gloss
                                    target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> party, and Christian groups, but
                                also some establishment figures. One possibility which we frequently
                                hear voiced is that opposition to the constitutional changes will
                                find its expression mainly in refusal to vote in the
                                referendum.</item>

                            <item>The loss of democratic processes may also give whatever opposition
                                exists a quality of desperation which it did not have as long as it
                                had recourse to constitutional democratic processes. It is not
                                possible to know at this stage, however, whether opposition will
                                persist, intensify, grow, or find more active expression in the
                                period to come. The government has in the past shown a
                                sophistication in its overwhelming display of force at the outset of
                                such crises which it then tapers off as acceptance of the
                                government’s position spreads. The <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                    >Park</persName> administration undoubtedly intends to combine
                                this tactic with massive use of the totally controlled media having
                                as objective to persuade, pacify, or neutralize opposition.</item>

                            <item>There is little doubt, however, that the government will employ
                                repressive measures if active opposition develops. The extent to
                                which it does so will depend in part upon the extent to which people
                                accept the changes without significant dissent or protest. The
                                government’s readiness to use its powers, and the outlines of an
                                even more authoritarian state than we have seen in the past, are
                                already clear enough. We have evidence that at least six or seven
                                members of the opposition <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> party
                                were detained and beaten by <gloss target="#t_ROK1"

                                17, some apparently for past rather than current opposition to
                                President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>. The
                                government has similarly struck some high school students in
                                connection with incipient protests at three or four high school
                                campuses as previously reported. Despite reports that house arrests
                                of opposition <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> leaders had ended,
                                we have reports that Yu Chi San and Kim Hong Kil remain under

                                out severe sentences of up to three years imprisonment for public

                                Newspapers and other media, meanwhile, have acquired a dull quality,
                                serving as much as vehicles for government propaganda as
                                distributors of news. There is no doubt of the government’s
                                intention to stifle any meaningful dissent or opposition and to use
                                any means necessary to that end.</item>

                                things it should do (i.e., avoid repression) to avoid making the

                            recess until March. Armored vehicles and troops will be removed from the
                            streets of Seoul late Nov 18, but martial law will not be lifted until
                            after the presidential election. <persName corresp="#p_CIK1"

                                six member inner council consulting regularly with the President on
                                governmental changes. He said at the outset that he had a long
                                drinking session with the President two nights ago and that the
                                President is appreciative that the Embassy here and the <gloss

                                seemed to be saying at the same time that <persName

                                    <item>The President and a small group of advisers made a
                                        decision on the morning of Nov 18 to reopen all universities
                                        Dec 1. University presidents will be informed immediately
                                        and public announcement is [garble]. The intention would be
                                        that students return mainly for final examinations.
                                        Universities would then close at the normal school year-end
                                        about Dec 20 and as usual remain in winter recess until
                                        March. Military units will be stationed near the
                                        universities, perhaps out of public view, but will not be
                                        placed on the campuses. <persName corresp="#p_CIK1"

                                        Unification Council and the Council would choose in secret
                                        ballot from among candidates so nominated. Under the other
                                        scheme, no nominations would be made and instead each
                                        Council member would simply write the name of a person he
                                        would like to have as President on his ballot; the person
                                        getting a majority vote would be elected.</item>

                                        Minister, but said there are also others. Ambassador to
                                        Tokyo Yi Ho, former Justice Minister, is a strong candidate
                                        to replace the present chief justice.</item>

                                brutality against prominent persons who have opposed the government.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CIK1">Chong</persName> acknowledged that
                                six former Assemblymen of the <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss>
                                have been beaten up, Kim Han Su having been treated worse than

                                secretary had also been badly mauled. In the process, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CIK1">Chong</persName> said the secretary had
                                finally disclosed the secret sources of <persName corresp="#p_KDJ1"
                                    >Kim Tae Chung</persName>’s funds. These were said by <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CIK1">Chong</persName> to be Korean companies who
                                were threatened by <persName corresp="#p_KDJ1">Kim Tae

                                    corresp="#p_CIK1">Chong</persName> that I had told the Prime
                                Minister and him, among others, from the beginning that use of
                                brutality is never justified. I urged him to make clear to the
                                President that news of the government’s use of these methods is
                                bound to get out and that, as the Greek experience had shown,
                                nothing would be more likely to alienate the American people.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CIK1">Chong</persName> predictably said he
                                agreed and that he personally had opposed this sort of thing. He
                                said it would stop. I am reasonably sure he will carry my message to
                                the President.</item>

                                outlying areas around the U.S. I replied that at this juncture
                                Washington is more important than the outlying areas but that in

                            unanimously support the President and his goals.<note n="2"

                                    corresp="#p_HPC1">Habib</persName> reported his conversation
                                with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KJP1">Kim Jong
                                    Pil</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_KJP1">Kim</persName> said
                                that the referendum was overwhelmingly successful (it passed with 92
                                percent of the vote) because “people generally recognized that
                                President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s leadership
                                had been successful and they saw no viable alternative for the
                                future.” He said that the President would be “exercising his vastly
                                increased powers with restraint” and that there would be a major
                                Cabinet reshuffle after the inauguration on December 27. (Ibid., POL
                                15 KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note> We see it rather as
                            an exercise in conformity reflecting acceptance of the inevitable. The
                            numerical accuracy of the results is difficult to assess and appears
                            less important than the way that they were achieved.</p>
                        <p>2. We see the referendum results as more an exercise in conformity than a
                            reflection of national sentiment for or against the constitutional
                            change. The pressures for conformity on the voters were both official
                            and social. No dissenting voices were permitted. The imposition of
                            martial law and the energetic enlightenment campaign left no doubt that
                            the government valued each man’s vote. This worked to produce a high
                            turn-out, since the voting polls would show whether a man voted or not.
                            The intimate and hierarchical relationship of Korean villagers meant
                            that once a consensus was determined there was social pressure for
                            individuals to concur. Because this “tribal” element is much weaker in
                            the cities, the large pro-amendment vote in Seoul and Pusan is less
                            likely to be accepted by Koreans as completely valid than results
                            elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>2. Whether or not the ballot boxes were stuffed is, as usual, difficult
                            to surmise and impossible to know. The absence of critical observers
                            would seem to make it more likely. On the other hand, the reputation of
                            “Korean democracy” and President’s mandate would be seriously tarnished
                            if evidence of vote counting irregularities were to come to light. On
                            balance, there seems no reason to question that an overwhelming majority
                            of the voters have for a variety of reasons accepted the government’s
                            new direction.</p>
                        <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0458"/>
                        <p>3. Apart from extending the President’s tenure indefinitely the
                            government’s massive drive to achieve the largest possible favorable
                            vote in the recently completed referendum can be seen as a harbinger of
                            things to come as the government moves in the direction of the national
                            solidarity and discipline for which President <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> is appealing. It has among other
                            things shown that factional strife and dissent, identified with the old
                            system, will be tolerated within much narrower bounds if at all. The
                            goal of a “total consensus” (ch’ongui) was among those proclaimed in the
                            “voter enlightenment” campaign we have just been through.</p>
                        <p>4. President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> now appears to
                            have set aside any desire or need to prove that he is more popular than
                            any available alternative ruler. In its place, his retention of power is
                            now based on (a) the fact that he is firmly and permanently established
                            in office and (b) the promises he made that he would unify the country
                            and promote prosperity. It is now understood that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> can be removed from office only by
                            death or a military coup. In the long run this may give his regime
                            additional strength or expose it to weakness, depending on his ability
                            to show progress toward the presidential goals, on the manner in which
                            he exercises the vast powers he now has, and the extent to which the
                            people approve or tolerate government under the new constitution. In the
                            short run, his position appears secure.</p>

                                between Seoul and Pyongyang were very great and would only be
                                overcome with much time and great patience. President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> had come to this conclusion
                                also and had expressed some reservations at the pace of developments
                                in the dialogue.</item>

                                <persName>Kim</persName> did not conceal his criticisms of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi Hu Rak</persName>’s efforts. He said it
                                appeared that because <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi Hu
                                    Rak</persName> was conducting negotiations his personal prestige
                                was involved with showing progress at every stage. This had led him
                                to conduct the negotiations with undue haste and without proper
                                attention to matters which should have been approached with greater
                                prudence. For example, at an early stage, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi</persName> wished to have the coordinating
                                committee include Cabinet members. This would have immediately moved
                                the dialogue to a government-to-government level prematurely. The
                                Prime Minister had objected and the President agreed this was not
                                desirable. The Prime Minister said no one was quite sure of what
                                    <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi Hu Rak</persName> had committed
                                himself to in discussions with the North Koreans. At one point it
                                looked as if he was pushing for an early summit meeting, but the
                                President would not go along. This was always a possibility but on
                                the basis of his understanding of the President’s position there
                                would be no meeting between <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                    >Park</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il

                            <item>I asked <persName>Kim</persName> what progress he thought might be
                                possible in the talks over the next year. He said that the talks
                                would not be broken off and that the meetings of the delegations,
                                both within the coordinating committee and the Red Cross frameworks,
                                would in itself constitute progress. There might be some exchange of
                                visits by particular groups in the cultural and sports fields, but
                                that was not sure and it was even less probable that economic
                                exchanges would be conducted within the next year.</item>

                                reducing the level of leadership at the coordinating committee and
                                of having someone other than <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi Hu
                                    Rak</persName> lead the South Korean delegation, just as Kim
                                Yong Chu was replaced by an acting chairman of the North Korean
                                delegation. I asked whether this would not be resented by the North
                                Koreans and viewed as a downgrading of the significance of the
                                meetings. Whereas they claim Kim Yong Chu was sick, no such claim
                                could be made for <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Yi Hu Rak</persName>.
                                He did not reply directly, but said it might be desirable to vary
                                the leadership. In any event, he said, President <persName

                                points of view. There is no doubt that the Prime Minister as well as

                                began by apologizing that as an opposition leader he had been unable
                                to prevent the arbitrary changes in the Korean Government. In
                                response to questions, he said he would probably go to Japan in
                                early December and return to Korea at the end of December or early
                                January according to the situation. He thought there would be some

                                <persName>Kim</persName> said the great defect of Korean democracy
                                was that it had not been deeply rooted through the efforts of the
                                Korean people. He returned several times to the theme that Koreans
                                must fight for democracy themselves and that he wanted to be in
                                Korea during this politically difficult period. He had concluded
                                that it was now almost impossible to accomplish a peaceful transfer
                                of power in Korea and that the choice was between unconditional
                                acceptance of the government or its violent overthrow. Several times
                                he asked in rhetorical fashion if there were any other way.
                                    <persName>Kim</persName> said that whatever style <persName

                                terminology he used, there was no democracy if there was no freedom

                                <persName>Kim</persName> said he understood the limitations on the
                                    <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Japanese Governments in

                                unfortunately democratic forces in Korea were oppressed by arms and
                                money supplied by these two governments, both of which were the
                                friends of the Korean people. <persName>Kim</persName> said <gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Japanese journalists had told him

                                Korea, it would generally be willing to accept what was an
                                accomplished fact primarily because it did not want to weaken the

                                the North. He thought <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>
                                had deliberately capitalized on this tendency.
                                    <persName>Kim</persName> concluded that there was a tendency
                                toward dictatorship in Asia. He said his understanding of the

                                Doctrine does not mean the withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_US1"

                                The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Doctrine did not

                            <item>Commenting on <persName>Kim</persName>’s remarks about the lack of
                                democratic roots in Korea <persName corresp="#p_GM1"
                                    >Green</persName> said he recognized the validity of these
                                remarks. He added that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was not
                                interested in seeing American style democracy in Korea as is
                                sometimes alleged but it does believe the essence of democracy
                                relates to the fundamental nature of man: that he is a free spirit
                                and wishes to participate in the formulation of his own destiny. He
                                thought that countries seeking progress also sought stability and
                                that most had no democratic tradition to guide them. Nonetheless,
                                the trend was towards self-expression and authoritarianism could not
                                last long where people could think for themselves. Those peoples who
                                strive for institutions of this sort will find sympathy among the
                                American people. In the case of Korea, the search for democratic
                                institutions had been uneven but there was no doubt that it would be
                                successful or that Mr. <persName>Kim</persName> would have a
                                constructive role to play.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Green</persName> emphasized that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> wished to maintain close
                                relations with the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> and to give
                                the government our support. He noted particularly the past close
                                relations between the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Congress and
                                the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> National Assembly and
                                thought the Congress would follow events in Korea closely. He hoped
                                martial law would soon give way to normalcy and that there would be
                                a return to normal political activity. He emphasized that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would not take actions which could
                                harm the Korean people; that as <persName>Kim</persName> knew we
                                thought the extraordinary measures taken by <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> were unnecessary but we did

                                    target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>. He did not think that violent
                                reaction would be to anyone’s advantage and reiterated that in the
                                long run governments must tolerate criticism and opposition. He
                                thought the international community could play some role in
                                encouraging this process in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.
                                For our part we would as appropriate counsel moderation on the part

                        <p>1. In 1972, events have set in motion changes which profoundly affect the
                            Korean peninsula. The July 4 Communiqué between the North and South and
                            President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s “October
                            Revitalization” program have changed completely the context of the
                            South-North relationship and the structure of government in the Republic
                            of Korea. Coupled with the developing new relationships between Korea’s
                            great power neighbors and the U.S., these changes affect not only Korea
                            but the U.S. role and policies here.</p>

                                establishing a substantive dialogue and the intergovernmental

                                (e.g., exchanges, economic relations, political discussions). The
                                July 4 Communiqué provided a framework within which future
                                negotiations between the two sides will be conducted.</item>

                            <item>While major substantive matters are being approached cautiously,
                                the process now in motion is not expected to cease and we expect
                                more measured, but still visible movement towards broader dialogue
                                and greater contacts between the South and the North. For the
                                foreseeable future, it is our assessment that neither side has as
                                its target organic unification but rather a level of accommodation
                                that does not threaten absolute control over their respective areas.
                                Each will seek to further its own short term objectives while biding
                                time on the larger issue of reunification.</item>

                            <item>As this process continues, it inevitably affects U.S. policy for
                                Korea. It affects assessments of the security threat and our

                                avoid actions which would threaten progress in the South-North
                                dialogue or give the impression that we are precipitately abandoning
                                the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. In sum, our policy and
                                programs need to be modified to reflect the new situation in

                                There have been no reported incidents along the <gloss

                            <item>Nevertheless, formidable military forces face each other. In
                                ground forces, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has an
                                advantage, and the navies are at a standoff. However, the North
                                maintains an advantage in air power if the U.S. air forces
                                availiable are not taken into account. This latter imbalance is not
                                serious in the current situation and the present and projected
                                deterrent power in total forces available to the <gloss

                                essentially achieved in terms of equipment, we have no doubt that

                                    >Park</persName> has abandoned a political course which has
                                served him and his nation well and which we have encouraged in Korea
                                for 25 years. With the “October Revitalization” he has deliberately
                                embarked on a program of highly personal, authoritarian rule. There
                                is now established a governmental structure based essentially on
                                tight executive control. We have commented on <persName

                                They involve a complex of factors including primarily his ambition
                                to remain in power and his long-standing unhappiness with the
                                constraints and political frustrations inherent under the former
                                constitution. <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> is also
                                convinced that in a changing international environment, and in
                                dealing with North Korea, his country’s national interest demands
                                his strong, unchallenged leadership.</item>

                            <item>We cannot now predict the future train of events. Stability in the
                                near future rests on <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s
                                ability, for the present unquestioned, to maintain control through
                                the traditional instruments of a dictatorship—the bureaucracy, the
                                police agencies and the Army. The “October Revitalization” will go
                                far beyond the political institutions in establishing firm, positive
                                government control over South Korean society. Measures now under
                                consideration would affect education, labor, the press and economic
                                life. The government speaks of exercising authority with restraint,
                                but there is little question that control will be firm and dissent
                                forbidden. However, disquiet exists, particularly among the educated

                            <item>In this situation, President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                    >Park</persName> is determined to move toward a policy of
                                greater “self-reliance,” diplomatically, economically and
                                militarily. Concern over the great powers, including the U.S., is a
                                clear theme in <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s
                                justification for his domestic political actions as well as the
                                South-North dialogue. However, <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                    >Park</persName>’s view of self-reliance, paradoxically,
                                includes a desire and an expressed need for the U.S. presence and
                                assistance to continue—at least in the short run. His concern that
                                we will reduce our aid program, withdraw our troops sooner than he
                                would like, and his doubt over the firmness of our treaty
                                commitment, come to the surface from time to time. Generally
                                speaking, he wishes to hold on to these elements of strength for as
                                long as he can, expecting they will diminish as time goes on.</item>

                                would be high through <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 75 and would

                                negotiations succeeded and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>

                                January 2 and complete all withdrawals by June 30. Vietnamese
                                Government had requested withdrawal to begin in mid ‘73 with one
                                division to be withdrawn by the end of the year and the second
                                division to be withdrawn in 1974. <gloss target="#t_ROKG1"

                                Therefore they were quietly going ahead with their plans to begin
                                withdrawal in January but not calling attention to their total
                                withdrawal plan.</item>

                            <item>Minister Yu said preparing a unit for withdrawal required ten days
                                time for turning its area over to the Vietnamese and assembling for
                                lift. The first units were originally scheduled to begin withdrawal
                                the first week in January and then continue at regular intervals. In
                                the current circumstances they were prepared to postpone the
                                beginning of the withdrawal cycle until the end of January. Even
                                with this postponement they were still planning to get all their
                                forces out by June 30, although there was always the possibility
                                that President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> might
                                reconsider on the basis of President <persName corresp="#p_NVT1"

                                withdrawal rate. In Yu’s opinion this would be only a modest
                                adjustment and not likely to go anywhere near meeting <persName

                            <item>Yu asked if I had any news that could affect these withdrawal
                                plans. I said that negotiations were obviously at a crucial point
                                and I thought his government should await the outcome of the current
                                round of meetings in Paris before making any decision. President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName> would be kept
                                informed on the course of negotiations. As he knew, under the terms
                                of the agreement withdrawal would begin immediately and <pb n="447"
                                    xml:id="pg_447" facs="0474"/>would be completed within sixty
                                days. If agreement were not reached soon it seemed prudent for

                                beginning regular withdrawal cycle until end of January. In any

                        <p>Under the recently approved revisions to the Korean constitution, an
                            indirect method of election of the President by a National Council for
                            Reunification has been established. This election will take place on
                            December 23, and it may be taken for granted that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_PCH1">Park Chung Hee</persName> will be reelected. His
                            inauguration will take place December 27.</p>
                        <p>Since October 17, when President <persName corresp="#p_PCH1"
                                >Park</persName> and his advisors began an extensive series of
                            changes to the Korean government, mainly accomplished under martial law
                            and government pressure, they have attempted to demonstrate to their
                            public that the United States supports their actions. We, however, have
                            taken the position that we were not consulted, and are not associated
                            with these changes. Publicly our position is that the constitutional
                            amendments were an internal matter on which we declined to comment.</p>
                        <p>Given the above circumstances, a congratulatory message from the
                            President poses certain problems. The Korean Government will make every
                            effort to publicize this message as White House approval of <pb n="448"
                                xml:id="pg_448" facs="0475"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PCH1">Park</persName>’s election. Notwithstanding,
                            considering our interests in Korea, a cordial but diplomatically correct
                            message is warranted.<note n="2" xml:id="d172fn2">The draft message is
                                attached. The substantive portion of the congratulatory note reads
                                as follows: “Dear Mr. President: Allow me to express the
                                congratulations of the American Government and people on your
                                election once more to the leadership of your country. I look forward
                                to the continuation of the cooperative and friendly relations that
                                have marked the close association of the past between our two
                                countries, and to working with you toward the goal of peace in
                                Asia.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I recommend that the enclosed congratulatory message be sent by the
                            President just as soon as the results have been officially
                                announced.<note n="3" xml:id="d172fn3">Telegram 231688 to Seoul,
