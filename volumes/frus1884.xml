                <head>MESSAGE.</head>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">To the Congress of the United States</hi>:</p>
                <p>Since the close of your last session the American people, in the exercise of
                    their highest right of suffrage, have chosen their Chief Magistrate for the four
                    years ensuing.</p>
                <p>When it is remembered that at no period in the country’s history has the long
                    political contest which customarily precedes the day of the national election
                    been waged with greater fervor and intensity, it is a subject of general
                    congratulation that after the controversy at the polls was over, and while the
                    slight preponderance by which the issue had been determined was as yet
                    unascertained, the public peace suffered no disturbance, but the people every
                    where patiently and quietly awaited the result.</p>
                <p>Nothing could more strikingly illustrate the temper of the American citizen, his
                    love of order, and his loyalty to law—nothing could more signally demonstrate
                    the strength and wisdom of our political institutions.</p>
                <p>Eight years have passed since a controversy concerning the result of a national
                    election sharply called the attention of the Congress to the necessity of
                    providing more precise and definite regulations for counting the electoral
                    vote.</p>
                <p>It is of the gravest importance that this question be solved before conflicting
                    claims to the Presidency shall again distract the country, and I am persuaded
                    that, by the people at large, any of the measures of relief thus far proposed
                    would be preferred to continued inaction.</p>
                <p>Our relations with all foreign powers continue to be amicable.</p>
                <p>With Belgium a convention has been signed whereby the scope of present treaties
                    has been so enlarged as to secure to citizens of either country within the
                    jurisdiction of the other equal rights and privileges in the acquisition and
                    alienation of property. A trade-marks treaty has also been concluded.</p>
                <p>The war between Chili and Peru is at an end. For the arbitration of the claims of
                    American citizens who during its continuance suffered through the acts of the
                    Chilian authorities a convention will soon be negotiated.</p>
                <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0034"/>
                <p>The state of hostilities between France and China continues to be an embarrassing
                    feature of our Eastern relations. The Chinese Government has promptly adjusted
                    and paid the claims of American citizens whose property was destroyed in the
                    recent riots at Canton. I renew the recommendation of my last annual message,
                    that the Canton indemnity fund be returned to China.</p>
                <p>The true interpretation of the recent treaty with that country, permitting the
                    restriction of Chinese immigration, is likely to be again the subject of your
                    deliberations. It may be seriously questioned whether the statute passed at the
                    last session does not violate the treaty rights of certain Chinese who left this
                    country with return certificates valid under the old law and who now seem to be
                    debarred from relanding for lack of the certificates required by the new.</p>
                <p>The recent purchase by citizens of the United States of a large trading fleet
                    heretofore under the Chinese flag has considerably enhanced our commercial
                    importance in the East. In view of the large number of vessels built or
                    purchased by American citizens in other countries and exclusively employed in
                    legitimate traffic between foreign ports under the recognized protection of our
                    flag, it might be well to provide a uniform rule for their registration and
                    documentation, so that the <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> property rights of
                    our citizens therein shall be duly evidenced and properly guarded.</p>
                <p>Pursuant to the advice of the Senate at the last session, I recognized the flag
                    of the International Association of the Congo as that of a friendly government,
                    avoiding in so doing any prejudgment of conflicting territorial claims in that
                    region. Subsequently, in execution of the expressed wish of the Congress, I
                    appointed a commercial agent for the Congo Basin.</p>
                <p>The importance of the rich prospective trade of the Congo Valley has led to the
                    general conviction that it should be open to all nations upon equal terms. At an
                    international conference for the consideration of this subject called by the
                    Emperor of Germany, and now in session at Berlin, delegates are in attendance on
                    behalf of the United States. Of the results of the conference you will be duly
                    advised.</p>
                <p>The Government of Corea has generously aided the efforts of the United States
                    minister to secure suitable premises for the use of the legation. As the
                    conditions of diplomatic intercourse with Eastern nations demand that the
                    legation premises be owned by the represented power, I advise that an
                    appropriation be made for the acquisition of this property by the Government.
                    The United States already possess valuable premises at Tangier as a gift from
                    the Sultan of Morocco. As is stated hereafter, they have lately received a
                    similar gift from the Siamese Government. The Government of Japan stands ready
                    to present <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0035"/>to us extensive grounds at Tokio
                    whereon to erect a suitable building for the legation, court-house, and jail;
                    and similar privileges can probably be secured in China and Persia. The owning
                    of such premises would not only effect a large saving of the present rentals but
                    would permit of the due assertion of extraterritorial rights in those countries,
                    and would the better serve to maintain the dignity of the United States.</p>
                <p>The failure of Congress to make appropriation for our representation at the
                    autonomous court of the Khedive has proved a serious embarrassment in our
                    intercourse with Egypt; and in view of the necessary intimacy of diplomatic
                    relationship due to the participation of this Government, as one of the treaty
                    powers, in all matters of administration there affecting the rights of
                    foreigners, I advise the restoration of the-agency and consulate-general at
                    Cairo on its former basis. I do not conceive it to be the wish of Congress that
                    the United States should withdraw altogether from the honorable position they
                    have hitherto held with respect to the Khedive, or that citizens of this
                    republic residing or sojourning in Egypt should hereafter be without the aid and
                    protection of a competent representative.</p>
                <p>With France, the traditional cordial relationship continues. The colossal statue
                    of Liberty enlightening the World, the generous gift of the people of France, is
                    expected to reach New York in May next. I suggest that Congressional action be
                    taken in recognition of the spirit which has prompted this gift, and in aid of
                    the timely completion of the pedestal upon which it is to be placed.</p>
                <p>Our relations with Germany, a country which contributes to our own some of the
                    best elements of citizenship, continue to be cordial. The United States have
                    extradition treaties with several of the German states, but by reason of the
                    confederation of those states under the Imperial rule, the application of such
                    treaties is not as uniform and comprehensive as the interests of the two
                    countries require. I propose, therefore, to open negotiations for a single
                    convention of extradition to embrace all the territory of the Empire.</p>
                <p>It affords me pleasure to say that our intercourse with Great Britain continues
                    to be of a most friendly character.</p>
                <p>The Government of Hawaii has indicated its willingness to continue for seven
                    years the provisions of the existing reciprocity treaty. Such continuance, in
                    view of the relations of that country to the American system of States, should
                    in my judgment be favored.</p>
                <p>The revolution in Hayti against the established government has terminated. While
                    it was in progress it became necessary to enforce <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI"
                        facs="0036"/>our neutrality laws by instituting proceedings against
                    individuals and vessels charged with their infringement. These prosecutions were
                    in all cases successful.</p>
                <p>Much anxiety has lately been displayed by various European governments, and
                    especially by the Government of Italy for the abolition of our import duties
                    upon works of art. It is well to consider whether the present discrimination in
                    favor of the productions of American artists abroad is not likely to result, as
                    they themselves seem very generally to believe it may, in the practical
                    exclusion of our painters and sculptors from the rich fields for observation,
                    study, and labor which they have hitherto enjoyed.</p>
                <p>There is prospect that the long-pending revision of the foreign treaties of Japan
                    may be concluded at a new conference to be held at Tokio. While this Government
                    fully recognizes the equal and independent station of Japan in the community of
                    nations, it would not oppose the general adoption of such terms of compromise as
                    Japan may be disposed to offer in furtherance of a uniform policy of intercourse
                    with Western nations.</p>
                <p>During the past year the increasing good-will between our own Government and that
                    of Mexico has been variously manifested. The treaty of commercial reciprocity
                    concluded January 20, 1883, has been ratified, and awaits the necessary tariff
                    legislation of Congress to become effective. This legislation will, I doubt not,
                    be among the first measures to claim your attention.</p>
                <p>A full treaty of commerce, navigation, and consular rights is much to be desired,
                    and such a treaty I have reason to believe that the Mexican Government stands
                    ready to conclude.</p>
                <p>Some embarrassment has been occasioned by the failure of Congress at its last
                    session to provide means for the due execution of the treaty of July 29, 1882,
                    for the resurvey of the Mexican boundary and the relocation of boundary
                    monuments.</p>
                <p>With the Republic of Nicaragua a treaty has been concluded which authorizes the
                    construction by the United States of a canal, railway, and telegraph line across
                    the Nicaraguan territory.</p>
                <p>By the terms of this treaty sixty miles of the river San Juan, as well as Lake
                    Nicaragua, an inland sea forty miles in width, are to constitute a part of the
                    projected enterprise.</p>
                <p>This leaves for actual canal construction seventeen miles on the Pacific side and
                    thirty-six miles on the Atlantic. To the United States, whose rich territory on
                    the Pacific is for the ordinary purposes of commerce practically cut off from
                    communication by water with the Atlantic ports, the political and commercial
                    advantages of such a project can scarcely be overestimated.</p>
                <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0037"/>
                <p>It is believed that when the treaty is laid before you the justice and liberality
                    of its provisions will command universal approval at home and abroad.</p>
                <p>The death of our representative at Russia while at his post at St. Petersburg
                    afforded to the Imperial Government a renewed opportunity to testify its
                    sympathy in a manner befitting the intimate friendliness which has ever marked
                    the intercourse of the two countries.</p>
                <p>The course of this Government in raising its representation at Bangkok to the
                    diplomatic rank has evoked from Siam evidences of warm friendship and augurs
                    well for our enlarged intercourse. The Siamese Government has presented to the
                    United States a commodious mansion and grounds for the occupancy of the
                    legation, and I suggest that by joint resolution Congress attest its
                    appreciation of this generous gift.</p>
                <p>This Government has more than once been called upon of late to take action in
                    fulfillment of its international obligations toward Spain. Agitation in the
                    island of Cuba hostile to the Spanish crown having been fomented by persons
                    abusing the sacred rights of hospitality which our territory affords, the
                    officers of this Government have been instructed to exercise vigilance to
                    prevent infractions of our neutrality laws at Key West and at other points near
                    the Cuban coast. I am happy to say that in the only instance where these
                    precautionary measures were successfully eluded, the offenders when found in our
                    territory were subsequently tried and convicted.</p>
                <p>The growing need of close relationship of intercourse and traffic between the
                    Spanish Antilles and their natural market in the United States led to the
                    adoption, in January last, of a commercial agreement looking to that end. This
                    agreement has since been superseded by a more carefully framed and comprehensive
                    convention, which I shall submit to the Senate for approval. It has been the aim
                    of this negotiation to open such a favored reciprocal exchange of productions
                    carried under the flag of either country, as to make the intercourse between
                    Cuba and Porto Rico and ourselves scarcely less intimate than the commercial
                    movement between our domestic ports, and to insure a removal of the burdens on
                    shipping in the Spanish Indies, of which in the past our ship-owners and
                    ship-masters have so often had cause to complain.</p>
                <p>The negotiation of this convention has for a time postponed the prosecution of
                    certain claims of our citizens which were declared to be without the
                    jurisdiction of the late Spanish-American Claims Commission, and which are
                    therefore remitted to diplomatic channels for adjustment. The speedy settlement
                    of these claims will now be urged by this Government.</p>
                <pb n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0038"/>
                <p>Negotiations for a treaty of commercial reciprocity with the Dominican Republic
                    have been successfully concluded, and the result will shortly be laid before the
                    Senate.</p>
                <p>Certain questions between the United States and the Ottoman Empire still remain
                    unsolved. Complaints on behalf of our citizens are not satisfactorily adjusted.
                    The Porte has sought to withhold from our commerce the right of favored
                    treatment to which we are entitled by existing conventional stipulations, and
                    the revision of the tariffs is unaccomplished.</p>
                <p>The final disposition of pending questions with Venezuela has not as yet been
                    reached, but I have good reason to expect an early settlement, which will
                    provide the means of re-examining the Caracas awards in conformity with the
                    expressed desire of Congress, and which will recognize the justice of certain
                    claims preferred against Venezuela.</p>
                <p>The Central and South American Commission appointed by authority of the act of
                    July 7, 1884, will soon proceed to Mexico. It has been furnished with
                    instructions which will be laid before you. They contain a statement of the
                    general policy of the Government for enlarging its commercial intercourse with
                    American States. The commissioners have been actively preparing for their
                    responsible task by holding conferences in the principal cities with merchants
                    and others interested in Central and South American trade.</p>
                <p>The International Meridian Conference, lately convened in Washing-ton upon the
                    invitation of the Government of the United States, was composed of
                    representatives from twenty-five nations. The conference concluded its labors on
                    the 1st of November, having with substantial unanimity agreed upon the meridian
                    of Greenwich as the starting point whence longitude is to be computed through
                    one hundred and eighty degrees eastward and westward, and upon the adoption, for
                    all purposes for which it may be found convenient, of a universal day which
                    shall begin at midnight on the initial meridian and whose hours shall be counted
                    from zero up to twenty-four.</p>
                <p>The formal report of the transactions of this conference will be hereafter
                    transmitted to the Congress.</p>
                <p>This Government is in frequent receipt of invitations from foreign states to
                    participate in international exhibitions, often of great interest and
                    importance. Occupying as we do an advanced position in the world’s production,
                    and aiming to secure a profitable share for our industries in the general
                    competitive markets, it is a matter of serious concern that the want of means
                    for participation in these exhibitions should so often exclude our producers
                    from advantages enjoyed by <pb n="IX" xml:id="pg_IX" facs="0039"/>those of other
                    countries. During the past year the attention of Congress was drawn to the
                    formal invitations in this regard tendered by the Governments of England,
                    Holland, Belgium, Germany, and Austria. The Executive has in some instances
                    appointed honorary commissioners. This is, however, a most unsatisfactory
                    expedient, for without some provision to meet the necessary working expenses of
                    a commission it can effect little or nothing in behalf of exhibitors. An
                    international inventions exhibition is to be held in London next May. This will
                    cover a field of special importance, in which our country holds a foremost rank,
                    but the Executive is at present powerless to organize a proper representation of
                    our vast national interests in this direction.</p>
                <p>I have in several previous messages referred to this subject. It seems to me that
                    a statute, giving to the Executive general discretionary authority to accept
                    such invitations, and to appoint honorary commissioners, without salary, and
                    placing at the disposal of the Secretary of State a small fund for defraying
                    their reasonable expenses, would be of great public utility.</p>
                <p>This Government has received official notice that the Revised International
                    Regulations for preventing collisions at sea have been adopted by all the
                    leading maritime powers except the United States, and came into force on the 1st
                    of September last. For the due protection of our shipping interests, the
                    provisions of our statutes should at once be brought into conformity with these
                    Regulations.</p>
                <p>The question of securing to authors, composers, and artists copyright privileges
                    in this country in return for reciprocal rights abroad is one that may justly
                    challenge your attention. It is true that conventions will be necessary for
                    fully accomplishing this result, but until Congress shall by statute fix the
                    extent to which foreign holders of copyright shall be here privileged, it has
                    been deemed inadvisable to negotiate such conventions. For this reason the
                    United States were not represented at the recent conference at Berne.</p>
                <p>I recommend that the scope of the neutrality laws of the United States be so
                    enlarged as to cover all patent acts of hostility committed in our territory and
                    aimed against the peace of a friendly nation. Existing statutes prohibit the
                    fitting out of armed expeditions and restrict the shipment of explosives, though
                    the enactments in the latter respect were not framed with regard to
                    international obligations, but simply for the protection of passenger travel.
                    All these statutes were intended to meet special emergencies that had already
                    arisen. Other emergencies have arisen since, and modern ingenuity supplies means
                    for the organization of hostilities without open resort to armed vessels or to
                    filibustering parties.</p>
                <pb n="X" xml:id="pg_X" facs="0040"/>
                <p>I see no reason why overt preparations in this country for the commission of
                    criminal acts, such as are here under consideration, should not be alike
                    punishable, whether such acts are intended to be committed in our own country or
                    in a foreign country with which we are at peace.</p>
                <p>The prompt and thorough treatment of this question is one which intimately
                    concerns the national honor.</p>
                <p>Our existing naturalization laws also need revision. Those sections relating to
                    persons residing within the limits of the United States in 1795 and 1798 have
                    now only a historical interest. Section 2172, recognizing the citizenship of the
                    children of naturalized parents, is ambiguous in its terms and partly obsolete.
                    There are special provisions of law favoring the naturalization of those who
                    serve in the Army or in merchant vessels, while no similar privileges are
                    granted those who serve in the Navy or the Marine Corps.</p>
                <p>“An uniform rule of naturalization,” such as the Constitution contemplates,
                    should, among other things, clearly define the status of persons born within the
                    United States subject to a foreign power (section 1992) and of minor children of
                    fathers who have declared their intention to become citizens but have failed to
                    perfect their naturalization. It might be wise to provide for a central bureau
                    of registry, wherein should be filed authenticated transcripts of every record
                    of naturalization in the several Federal and State courts, and to make provision
                    also for the vacation or cancellation of such record in cases where fraud had
                    been practiced upon the court by the applicant himself or where he had renounced
                    or forfeited his acquired citizenship. A just and uniform law in this respect
                    would strengthen the hands of the Government in protecting its citizens abroad,
                    and would pave the way for the conclusion of treaties of naturalization with
                    foreign countries.</p>
                <p>The legislation of the last session effected in the diplomatic and consular
                    service certain changes and reductions which have been productive of
                    embarrassment. The population and commercial activity of our country are
                    steadily on the increase, and are giving rise to new, varying, and often
                    delicate relationships with other countries. Our foreign establishment now
                    embraces nearly double the area of operations that it occupied twenty years ago.
                    The confinement of such a service within the limits of expenditure then
                    established is not, it seems to me, in accordance with true economy. A community
                    of sixty millions of people should be adequately represented in its intercourse
                    with foreign nations.</p>
                <p>A project for the reorganization of the consular service and for recasting the
                    scheme of extraterritorial jurisdiction is now before you. If the limits of a
                    short session will not allow of its full consideration, I trust that you will
                    not fail to make suitable provision for the present needs of the service.</p>
                <pb n="XI" xml:id="pg_XI" facs="0041"/>
                <p>It has been customary to define in the appropriation acts the rank of each
                    diplomatic office to which a salary is attached. I suggest that this course be
                    abandoned and that it be left to the President, with the advice and consent of
                    the Senate, to fix from time to time the diplomatic grade of the representatives
                    of this Government abroad as may seem advisable, provision being definitely
                    made, however, as now for the amount of salary attached to the respective
                    stations.</p>
                <p>The condition of our finances and the operations of the various branches of the
                    public service which are connected with the Treasury Department are very fully
                    discussed in the report of the Secretary.</p>

                <p>The Secretary estimates the total receipts for the fiscal year which will end

                <p>I concur with the Secretary of the Treasury in recommending the immediate
                    suspension of the coinage of silver dollars and of the issuance of silver
                    certificates. This is a matter to which, in former communications, I have more
                    than once invoked the attention of the National Legislature.</p>
                <p>It appears that annually for the past six years there have been coined, in
                    compliance with the requirements of the act of February 28, 1878, more than
                    twenty-seven million silver dollars. The number now outstanding <pb n="XIII"
                        xml:id="pg_XIII" facs="0043"/>is reported by the Secretary to be nearly one
                    hundred and eighty-five million, whereof but little more than forty million, or
                    less than 22 per cent., are in actual circulation. The mere existence of this
                    fact seems to me to furnish of itself a cogent argument for the repeal of the
                    statute which has made such fact possible.</p>
                <p>But there are other and graver considerations that tend in the same
                    direction.</p>
                <p>The Secretary avows his conviction that unless this coinage and the issuance of
                    silver certificates be suspended, silver is likely at no distant day to become
                    our sole metallic standard. The commercial disturbance and the impairment of
                    national credit that would be thus occasioned can scarcely be overestimated.</p>
                <p>I hope that the Secretary’s suggestions respecting the withdrawal from
                    circulation of the one-dollar and two-dollar notes will receive your approval.
                    It is likely that a considerable portion of the silver now encumbering the
                    vaults of the Treasury might thus find its way into the currency.</p>
                <p>While trade-dollars have ceased, for the present at least, to be an element of
                    active disturbance in our currency system, some provision should be made for
                    their surrender to the Government. In view of the circumstances under which they
                    were coined and of the fact that they have never had a legal-tender quality,
                    there should be offered for them only a slight advance over their bullion
                    value.</p>
                <p>The Secretary, in the course of his report, considers the propriety of
                    beautifying the designs of our subsidiary silver coins and of so increasing
                    their weight that they may bear their due ratio of value to the standard dollar.
                    His conclusions in this regard are cordially approved.</p>
                <p>In my annual message of 1882, I recommended the abolition of all excise taxes
                    except those relating to distilled spirits. This recommendation is now renewed.
                    In case these taxes shall be abolished, the revenues that will still remain to
                    the Government will, in my opinion, not only suffice to meet its reasonable
                    expenditures, but will afford a surplus large enough to permit such tariff
                    reduction as may seem to be advisable, when the results of recent revenue laws
                    and commercial treaties shall have shown in what quarters those reductions can
                    be most judiciously effected.</p>
                <p>One of the gravest of the problems which appeal to the wisdom of Congress for
                    solution is the ascertainment of the most effective means for increasing our
                    foreign trade and thus relieving the depression under which our industries are
                    now languishing. The Secretary of the Treasury advises that the duty of
                    investigating this subject be intrusted in the first instance to a competent
                    commission. While fully recognizing the considerations that may be urged against
                    this course, I am nevertheless of the opinion that, upon the whole, no other
                    would be likely to effect speedier or better results.</p>
                <p>That portion of the Secretary’s report which concerns the condition <pb n="XIV"
                        xml:id="pg_XIV" facs="0044"/>of our shipping interests cannot fail to
                    command your attention. He emphatically recommends that as an incentive to the
                    investment of American capital in American steamships, the Government shall by
                    liberal payments for mail transportation, or otherwise, lend its active
                    assistance to individual enterprise, and declares his belief that unless that
                    course be pursued our foreign carrying trade must remain, as it is to-day,
                    almost exclusively in the hands of foreigners.</p>
                <p>One phase of this subject is now especially prominent, in view of the repeal by
                    the act of June 26, 1884, of all statutory provisions arbitrarily compelling
                    American vessels to carry the mails to and from the United States. As it is
                    necessary to make provision to compensate the owners of such vessels for
                    performing that service after April, 1885, it is hoped that the whole subject
                    will receive early consideration that will lead to the enactment of such
                    measures for the revival of our merchant marine as the wisdom of Congress may
                    devise.</p>
                <p>The three per cent, bonds of the Government to the amount of more than
                    $100,000,000 have, since my last annual message, been redeemed by the Treasury.
                    The bonds of that issue still outstanding amount to little over $200,000,000,
                    about one-fourth of which will be retired through the operations of the sinking
                    fund during the coming year. As these bonds still constitute the chief basis for
                    the circulation of the national banks, the question how to avert the contraction
                    of the currency, caused by their retirement, is one of constantly increasing
                    importance.</p>
                <p>It seems to be generally conceded that the law governing this matter exacts from
                    the banks excessive security, and that, upon their present bond deposits, a
                    larger circulation than is now allowed may be granted with safety. I hope that
                    the bill which passed the Senate at the last session, permitting the issue of
                    notes equal to to the face value of the deposited bonds, will commend itself to
                    the approval of the House of Representatives.</p>
                <p>In the expenses of the War Department the Secretary reports a decrease of more
                    than $9,000,000. Of this reduction $5,600,000 was effected in the expenditures
                    for rivers and harbors, and $2,700,000 in expenditures for the Quartermaster’s
                    Department.</p>
                <p>Outside of that Department the annual expenses of all the Army-bureaus proper
                    (except possibly the Ordnance Bureau) are substantially fixed charges, which can
                    not be materially diminished without a change in the numerical strength of the
                    Army. The expenditures in the Quartermaster’s Department can readily be
                    subjected to administrative discretion, and it is reported by the Secretary of
                    War that as a result of exercising such discretion, in reducing the number of
                    draught and pack animals in the Army, the annual cost of supplying and caring
                    for such animals is now $1,108,085.90 less than it was in 1881.</p>
                <pb n="XV" xml:id="pg_XV" facs="0045"/>
                <p>The reports of military commanders show that the last year has been notable for
                    its entire freedom from Indian outbreaks.</p>
                <p>In defiance of the President’s proclamation of July 1, 1884, certain intruders
                    sought to make settlements in the Indian Territory, They were promptly removed
                    by a detachment of troops.</p>
                <p>During the past session of Congress a bill to provide a suitable fireproof
                    building for the Army Medical Museum and the library of the Surgeon-General’s
                    Office received the approval of the Senate. A similar bill, reported favorably
                    to the House of Representatives by one of its committees, is still pending
                    before that body. It is hoped that during the coming session the measure may
                    become a law, and that thereafter immediate steps may be taken to secure a place
                    of safe deposit for these valuable collections, now in a state of
                    insecurity.</p>
                <p>The funds with which the works for the improvement of rivers and harbors were
                    prosecuted during the past year were derived from the appropriations of the act
                    of August 2, 1882, together with such few balances as were on hand from previous
                    appropriations. The balance in the Treasury subject to requisition July 1, 1883,
                    was $10,021,649.55. The amount appropriated during the fiscal year 1884 was
                    $1,319,634.62, and the amount drawn from the Treasury during the fiscal year was
                    $8,228,703.54, leaving a balance of $3,112,580.63 in the Treasury subject to
                    requisition July 1, 1884.</p>
                <p>The Secretary of War submits the report of the Chief of Engineers as to the
                    practicability of protecting bur important cities on the seaboard by
                    fortifications and other defenses able to repel modern methods of attack. The
                    time has now come when such defenses can be prepared with confidence that they
                    will not prove abortive; and, when the possible result of delay in making such
                    preparation is seriously considered, delay seems inexcusable. For the most
                    important cities—those whose destruction or capture would be a national
                    humiliation—adequate defenses, inclusive of guns, may be made by the gradual
                    expenditure of $60,000,000, a sum much less than a victorious enemy could levy
                    as a contribution. An appropriation of about one-tenth of that amount is asked
                    to begin the work, and I concur with the Secretary of War in urging that it be
                    granted.</p>
                <p>The War Department is proceeding with the conversion of 10-inch smooth-bore guns
                    into 8-inch rifles, by lining the former with tubes of forged steel or of coiled
                    wrought-iron. Fifty guns will be thus converted within the year. This, however,
                    does not obviate the necessity of providing means for the construction of guns
                    of the highest power, both for the purposes of coast defense and for the
                    armament of war vessels.</p>
                <p>The report of the Gun Foundery Board, appointed April 2, 1883, in pursuance of
                    the act of March 3, 1883, was transmitted to Congress in a special message of
                    February 18, 1884. In my message of March 26, 1884, I called attention to the
                    recommendation of the Board that the <pb n="XVI" xml:id="pg_XVI" facs="0046"
                    />Government should encourage the production at private steel works of the
                    required material for heavy cannon, and that two government factories, one for
                    the Army and one for the Navy, should be established for the fabrication of guns
                    from such material. No action having been taken, the Board was subsequently
                    reconvened to determine more fully the plans and estimates necessary for
                    carrying out its recommendation. It has received information which indicates
                    that there are responsible steel manufacturers in this country who, although not
                    provided at present with the necessary plant, are willing to construct the same
                    and to make bids for contracts with the Government for the supply, of the
                    requisite material for the heaviest guns adapted to modern warfare, if a
                    guaranteed order of sufficient magnitude, accompanied by a positive
                    appropriation extending over a series of years, shall be made by Congress. All
                    doubts as to the feasibility of the plan being thus removed, I renew my
                    recommendation that such action be taken by Congress as will enable the
                    Government to construct its own ordnance upon its own territory, and so to
                    provide the armaments demanded by considerations of national safety and
                    honor.</p>
                <p>The report of the Secretary of the Navy exhibits the progress which has been made
                    on the new steel cruisers authorized by the acts of August 5, 1882, and March 3,
                    1883. Of the four vessels under contract, one, the Chicago, of 4,500 tons, is
                    more than half finished; the Atlanta, of 3,000 tons, has been successfully
                    launched, and her machinery is now fitting; the Boston, also of 3,000 tons, is
                    ready for launching, and the Dolphin, a dispatch steamer of 1,500 tons, is ready
                    for delivery.</p>
                <p>Certain adverse criticisms upon the designs of these cruisers are discussed by
                    the Secretary, who insists that the correctness of the conclusions reached by
                    the Advisory Board and by the Department has been demonstrated by recent
                    developments in ship-building abroad.</p>
                <p>The machinery of the double-turreted monitors Puritan, Terror, and Amphitrite,
                    contracted for under the act of March 3, 1883, is in process of construction. No
                    work has been done during the past year on their armor for lack of the necessary
                    appropriations. A fourth monitor, the Monadnock, still remains unfinished at the
                    navy-yard in California. It is recommended that early steps be taken to complete
                    these vessels and to provide also an armament for the monitor Miantonomoh.</p>
                <p>The recommendations of the Naval Advisory Board, approved by the Department,
                    comprise the construction of one steel cruiser of 4,500 tons, one cruiser of
                    3,000 tons, two heavily-armed gunboats, one light cruising gunboat, one
                    dispatch-vessel armed with Hotchkiss cannon, one armored ram, and three torpedo
                    boats. The general designs, all of which are calculated to meet the existing
                    wants of the service, are now well advanced, and the construction of the vessels
                    can be undertaken as soon as you shall grant the necessary authority.</p>
                <p>The act of Congress approved August 7, 1882, authorized the removal <pb n="XVII"
                        xml:id="pg_XVII" facs="0047"/>to the United States of the bodies of
                    Lieutenant-Commander George W. De Long and his companions of the Jeannette
                    Expedition. This removal has been successfully accomplished by Lieutenants
                    Harber and Schuetze. The remains were taken from their grave in the Lena Delta
                    in March, 1883, and were retained at Yakutsk until the following winter, the
                    season being too far advanced to admit of their immediate transportation. They
                    arrived at New York February 20, 1884, where they were received with suitable
                    honors.</p>
                <p>In pursuance of the joint resolution of Congress approved February 13, 1884, a
                    naval expedition was fitted out for the relief of Lieut. A. W. Greely, United
                    States Army, and of the party who had been engaged under his command in
                    scientific observations at Lady Franklin Bay. The fleet consisted of the steam
                    sealer Thetis, purchased in England, the Bear, purchased at St. John’s,
                    Newfoundland, and the Alert, which was generously provided by the British
                    Government. Preparations for the expedition were promptly made by the Secretary
                    of the Navy, with the active co-operation of the Secretary of War. Commander
                    George W. Coffin was placed in command of the Alert, and Lieut. William H. Emory
                    in command of the Bear. The Thetis was intrusted to Commander Winfield S.
                    Schley, to whom also was assigned the superintendence of the entire
                    expedition.</p>
                <p>Immediately upon its arrival at Upernavik, the fleet began the dangerous
                    navigation of Melville Bay, and in spite of every obstacle reached Littleton
                    Island on June 22, a fortnight earlier than any vessel had before attained that
                    point. On the same day it crossed over to Cape Sabine, where Lieutenant Greely
                    and the other survivors of his party were discovered. After taking on board the
                    living and the bodies of the dead, the relief ships sailed for St. John’s, where
                    they arrived on July 17. They were appropriately received at Portsmouth, N. H.,
                    on August 1, and at New York on August 8. One of the bodies was landed at the
                    former place. The others were put on shore at Governor’s Island, and, with the
                    exception of one which was interred in the National Cemetery, were forwarded
                    thence to the destinations indicated by friends. The organization and conduct of
                    this Relief Expedition reflects great credit upon all who contributed to its
                    success.</p>
                <p>In this, the last of the stated messages that I shall have the honor to transmit
                    to the Congress of the United States, I cannot too strongly urge upon its
                    attention the duty of restoring our navy as rapidly as possible to the high
                    state of efficiency which formerly characterized it. As the long peace that has
                    lulled us into a sense of fancied security may at any time be disturbed, it is
                    plain that the policy of strengthening this arm of the service is dictated by
                    considerations of wise economy, of just regard for our-future tranquillity, and
                    of true appreciation of the dignity and honor of the Republic.</p>
                <p>The report of the Postmaster-General acquaints you with the present condition and
                    needs of the postal service.</p>
                <pb n="XVIII" xml:id="pg_XVIII" facs="0048"/>
                <p>It discloses the gratifying fact that the loss of revenue from the reduction in
                    the rate of letter-postage recommended in my message of December 4, 1882, and
                    effected by the act of March 3, 1883, has been much less than was generally
                    anticipated. My recommendation of this reduction was based upon the belief that
                    the actual falling off in receipts from letter-postages for the year immediately
                    succeeding the change of rate would be $3,000,000. It has proved to be only
                    $2,275,000.</p>
                <p>This is a trustworthy indication that the revenue will soon be restored to its
                    former volume by the natural increase of sealed correspondence.</p>
                <p>I confidently repeat, therefore, the recommendation of my last annual message
                    that the single-rate postage upon drop letters be reduced to one cent wherever
                    the payment of two cents is now required by law. The double rate is only exacted
                    at offices where the carrier system is in operation, and it appears that at
                    those offices the increase in the tax upon local letters defrays the cost not
                    only of its own collection and delivery, but of the collection and delivery of
                    all other mail matter. This is an inequality that ought no longer to exist.</p>
                <p>I approve the recommendation of the Postmaster-General that the unit of weight in
                    the rating of first-class matter should be one ounce instead of one-half ounce
                    as it now is. In view of the statistics furnished by the Department it may well
                    be doubted whether the change would result in any loss of revenue; that it would
                    greatly promote the convenience of the public is beyond dispute.</p>
                <p>The free-delivery system has been lately applied to five cities, and the total
                    number of offices in which it is now in operation is one hundred and fifty-nine.
                    Experience shows that its adoption, under proper conditions, is equally an
                    accommodation to the public and an advantage to the postal service. It is more
                    than self-sustaining, and for the reasons urged by the Postmaster-General may
                    properly be extended.</p>
                <p>In the opinion of that officer it is important to provide means whereby
                    exceptional dispatch in dealing with letters in free-delivery offices may be
                    secured by payment of extraordinary postage. This scheme might be made effective
                    by employment of a special stamp whose cost should be commensurate with the
                    expense of the extra service.</p>
                <p>In some of the large cities private express companies have undertaken to outstrip
                    the Government mail-carriers by affording, for the prompt transmission of
                    letters, better facilities than have hitherto been at the command of the
                    Post-Office.</p>
                <p>It has always been the policy of the Government to discourage such enterprises,
                    and in no better mode can that policy be maintained than in supplying the public
                    with the most efficient mail service that, with due regard to its own best
                    interests, can be furnished for its accommodation.</p>
                <p>The Attorney-General renews the recommendation contained in his report of last
                    year touching the fees of witnesses and jurors.</p>
                <p>He favors radical changes in the fee bill, the adoption of a system by <pb
                        n="XIX" xml:id="pg_XIX" facs="0049"/>which attorneys and marshals of the
                    United States shall be compensated solely by salaries, and the erection by the
                    Government of a penitentiary for the confinement of offenders against its
                    laws.</p>
                <p>Of the varied governmental concerns in charge of the Interior Department, the
                    report of its Secretary presents an interesting summary. Among the topics
                    deserving particular attention I refer you to his observations respecting our
                    Indian affairs, the pre-emption and timber-culture acts, the failure of railroad
                    companies to take title to lands granted by the Government, and the operations
                    of the Pension Office, the Patent Office, the Census Bureau, and the Bureau of
                    Education.</p>
                <p>Allusion has been made already to the circumstance that, both as between the
                    different Indian tribes and as between the Indians and the whites, the past year
                    has been one of unbroken peace.</p>
                <p>In this circumstance the President is glad to find justification for the policy
                    of the Government in its dealing with the Indian question, and confirmation of
                    the views which were fully expressed in his first communication to the
                    Forty-seventh Congress.</p>
                <p>The Secretary urges anew the enactment of a statute for the punishment of crimes
                    committed on the Indian reservations, and recommends the passage of the bill now
                    pending in the House of Representatives for the purchase of a tract of 18,000
                    square miles from the Sioux reservation. Both these measures are worthy of
                    approval.</p>
                <p>I concur with him also in advising the repeal of the pre-emption law, the
                    enactment of statutes resolving the present legal complications touching lapsed
                    grants to railroad companies, and the funding of the debt of the several Pacific
                    railroads under such guaranty as shall effectually secure its ultimate
                    payment.</p>
                <p>The report of the Utah Commission will be read with interest.</p>
                <p>It discloses the results of recent legislation looking to the prevention and
                    punishment of polygamy in that Territory. I still believe that if that
                    abominable practice can be suppressed by law it can only be by the most radical
                    legislation consistent with the restraints of the Constitution.</p>
                <p>I again recommend, therefore, that Congress assume absolute political control of
                    the Territory of Utah, and provide for the appointment of commissioners, with
                    such governmental powers as in its judgment may justly and wisely be put into
                    their hands.</p>
                <p>In the course of this communication reference has more than once been made to the
                    policy of this Government as regards the extension of our foreign trade. It
                    seems proper to declare the general principles that should, in my opinion,
                    underlie our national efforts in this direction.</p>
                <p>The main conditions of the problem may be thus stated:</p>
                <p>We are a people apt in mechanical pursuits and fertile in invention; we cover a
                    vast extent of territory rich in agricultural products and in <pb n="XX"
                        xml:id="pg_XX" facs="0050"/>nearly all the raw materials necessary for
                    successful manufacture; we have a system of productive establishments more than
                    sufficient to supply our own demands; the wages of labor are nowhere else so
                    great; the scale of living of our artisan classes is such as tends to secure
                    their personal comfort and the development of those higher moral and
                    intellectual qualities that go to the making of good citizens. Our system of tax
                    and tariff legislation is yielding a revenue which is in excess of the present
                    needs of the Government.</p>
                <p>These are the elements from which it is sought to devise a scheme by which,
                    without unfavorably changing the condition of the workingman, our merchant
                    marine shall be raised from its enfeebled condition and new markets provided for
                    the sale, beyond our borders, of the manifold fruits of our industrial
                    enterprises.</p>
                <p>The problem is complex, and can be solved by no single measure of innovation or
                    reform.</p>
                <p>The countries of the American continent and the adjacent islands are for the
                    United States the natural marts of supply and demand. It is from them that we
                    should obtain what we do not produce or do not produce in sufficiency, and it is
                    to them that the surplus productions of our fields, our mills, and our workshops
                    should flow, under conditions that will equalize or favor them in comparison
                    with foreign competition.</p>
                <p>Four paths of policy seem to point to this end.</p>
                <list>
                    <item>First, a series of reciprocal commercial treaties with the countries of
                        America which shall foster between us and them an unhampered movement of
                        trade. The conditions of these treaties should be the free admission of such
                        merchandise as this country does not produce, in return for the admission
                        free or under a favored scheme of duties, of our own products—the benefits
                        of such exchange to apply only to goods carried under the flag of the
                        parties to the contract; the removal, on both sides, from the vessels so
                        privileged of all tonnage dues and national imposts so that those vessels
                        may ply unhindered between our ports and those of the other contracting
                        parties, though without infringing on the reserved home coasting trade; the
                        removal or reduction of burdens on the exported products of those countries
                        coming within the benefits of the treaties; and the avoidance of the
                        technical restrictions and penalties by which our intercourse with those
                        countries is at present hampered.</item>
                    <item>Secondly, the establishment of the consular service of the United States
                        on a salaried footing, thus permitting the relinquishment of consular fees
                        not only as respects vessels under the national flag, but also as respects
                        vessels of the treaty nations carrying goods entitled to the benefits of the
                        treaties.</item>
                    <item>Thirdly, the enactment of measures to favor the construction and
                        maintenance of a steam carrying marine under the flag of the United
                        States.</item>
                    <item>Fourthly, the establishment of an uniform currency basis for the countries
                        of America, so that the coined products of our mines may <pb n="XXI"
                            xml:id="pg_XXI" facs="0051"/>circulate on equal terms throughout the
                        whole system of commonwealths. This would require a monetary union of
                        America, whereby the output of the bullion-producing countries and the
                        circulation of those which yield neither gold nor silver could be adjusted
                        in conformity with the population, wealth, and commercial needs of each. As
                        many of the countries furnish no bullion to the common stock, the surplus
                        production of our mines and mints might thus be utilized and a step taken
                        toward the general remonetization of silver.</item>
                </list>
                <p>To the accomplishment of these ends, so far as they can be attained by separate
                    treaties, the negotiations already concluded and now in progress have been
                    directed, and the favor which this enlarged policy has thus far received
                    warrants the belief that its operations will ere long embrace all, or nearly
                    all, the countries of this hemisphere.</p>
                <p>It is by no means desirable, however, that the policy under consideration should
                    be applied to these countries alone. The healthful enlargement of our trade with
                    Europe, Asia, and Africa should be sought by reducing tariff burdens on such of
                    their wares as neither we nor the other American States are fitted to produce,
                    and thus enabling ourselves to obtain in return a better market for our supplies
                    of food, of raw materials, and of the manufactures in which we excel.</p>
                <p>It seems to me that many of the embarrassing elements in the great national
                    conflict between protection and free trade may thus be turned to good
                    account—that the revenue may be reduced so as no longer to overtax the people,
                    that protective duties may be retained without becoming burdensome, that our
                    shipping interests may be judiciously encouraged, the currency fixed on firm
                    bases, and above all such an unity of interests established among the states of
                    the American system as will be of great and ever increasing advantage to them
                    all.</p>
                <p>All treaties in the line of this policy which have been negotiated or are in
                    process of negotiation contain a provision deemed to be requisite under the
                    clause of the Constitution limiting to the House of Representatives the
                    authority to originate bills for raising revenue.</p>
                <p>On the 29th of February last I transmitted to the Congress the first annual
                    report of the Civil Service Commission, together with communications from the
                    heads of the several Executive Departments of the Government, respecting the
                    practical workings of the law under which the Commission had been acting. The
                    good results therein foreshadowed have been more than realized.</p>
                <p>The system has fully answered the expectations of its friends in securing
                    competent and faithful public servants and in protecting the appointing officers
                    of the Government from the pressure of personal importunity and from the labor
                    of examining the claims and pretensions of rival candidates for public
                    employment.</p>
                <p>The law has had the unqualified support of the President and of the heads of the
                    several Departments, and the members of the Commission <pb n="XXII"
                        xml:id="pg_XXII" facs="0052"/>have performed their duties with zeal and
                    fidelity. Their report will shortly be submitted, and will be accompanied by
                    such recommendations for enlarging the scope of the existing statute as shall
                    commend themselves to the Executive and the Commissioners charged with its
                    administration.</p>
                <p>In view of the general and persistent demand throughout the commercial community
                    for a national bankrupt law, I hope that the differences of sentiment which have
                    hitherto prevented its enactment may not outlast the present session.</p>
                <p>The pestilence which for the past two years has been raging in the countries of
                    the East recently made its appearance in European ports with which we are in
                    constant communication.</p>
                <p>The then Secretary of the Treasury, in pursuance of a proclamation of the
                    President, issued certain regulations restricting, and for a time prohibiting,
                    the importation of rags and the admission of baggage of immigrants and of
                    travelers arriving from infected quarters. Lest this course may have been
                    without strict warrant of law, I approve the recommendation of the present
                    Secretary that the Congress take action in the premises, and I also recommend
                    the immediate adoption of such measures as will be likely to ward off the
                    dreaded epidemic, and to mitigate its severity in case it shall unhappily extend
                    to our shores.</p>
                <p>The annual report of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia reviews the
                    operations of the several departments of its municipal government. I ask your
                    careful consideration of its suggestions in respect to legislation—especially
                    commending such as relate to a revision of the civil and criminal code, the
                    performance of labor by persons sentenced to imprisonment in the jail, the
                    construction and occupation of wharves along the river front, and the erection
                    of a suitable building for District offices.</p>
                <p>I recommend that, in recognition of the eminent services of Ulysses S. Grant,
                    late General of the Armies of the United States and twice President of this
                    nation, the Congress confer upon him a suitable pension.</p>
                <p>Certain of the measures that seem to me necessary and expedient I have now, in
                    obedience to the Constitution, recommended for your adoption.</p>
                <p>As respects others of no less importance, I shall content myself with renewing
                    the recommendations already made to the Congress, without restating the grounds
                    upon which such recommendations were based.</p>
                <pb n="XXIII" xml:id="pg_XXIII" facs="0053"/>
                <p>The preservation of forests on the public domain, the granting of Government aid
                    for popular education, the amendment of the Federal Constitution so as to make
                    effective the disapproval by the President of particular items in appropriation
                    bills, the enactment of statutes in regard to the filling of vacancies in the
                    Presidential office, and the determining of vexed questions respecting
                    Presidential inability are measures which may justly receive your serious
                    consideration.</p>
                <p>As the time draws nigh when I am to retire from the public service, I cannot
                    refrain from expressing to the members of the National Legislature with whom I
                    have been brought into personal and official intercourse my sincere appreciation
                    of their unfailing courtesy and of their harmonious co-operation with the
                    Executive in so many measures calculated to promote the best interests of the
                    Nation.</p>
                <p>And to my fellow-citizens generally I acknowledge a deep sense of obligation for
                    the support which they have accorded me in my administration of the Executive
                    Department of this Government.</p>

                            naturalized American citizen; he returned to Hungary in 1867, purchased

                            decree canceling the prohibition is suspended, owing to a resolution
                            introduced by Paul Bert in the Chamber of Deputies, but opposed by
                            minister of commerce; the question is one of protection, and not
                            affected by the alleged fear of trichinae in American pork; until
                            parliamentary action is taken American pork will be admitted at Havre,
                            Bordeaux, and Nantes, after examination under the control and expense of

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Argentine Congress closed its annual
                        session on the 22d instant. Of the great number of bills introduced, only
                        about seventy-five passed and became laws, and these have no importance
                        except to meet the local wants of the country. Under the recommendation of
                        the minister of finance a bill was introduced in the House of Deputies to
                        borrow $80,000,000 with a view to calling in the outstanding 6 per cent,
                        bonds and consolidating the debt of the country in 5 per cent, bonds, and
                        the construction of public works. The bill was defeated, and the finance
                        minister resigned. The bill which produced the greatest and most intense
                        agitation, not only in Congress but throughout the whole country, was a bill
                        introduced in the House prohibiting the teaching of religious dogmas in the
                        common schools. It provoked a warm and angry debate, which lasted more than
                        two weeks. The best debating talent of the House was called out on both
                        sides. The minister of education, representing the President and a majority
                        of the cabinet, appeared on the floor in favor of the bill and spoke for one
                        day. The press took up the question, was divided, and became very bitter.
                        The bill passed the House and went to the Senate. While the bill was under
                        discussion in the Senate a procession of more than one thousand ladies of
                        the first families of this city proceeded to the Senate and presented to the
                        president a petition, signed by many thousands of women, asking the Senate
                        to refuse to pass the bill. A vote was immediately taken, and by “smart
                        judgment” the bill was rejected by one vote. In some of the speeches of the
                        senators and deputies it was strongly intimated that the time was close at
                        hand for the separation of church and state, and as it is quite probable
                        that the matter will come up in the next Congress, I should not be surprised
                        if such a proposition should be presented looking in that direction, as many
                        both in the church and state believe that in a separation both the state and
                        church would make better progress than under the present organization.</p>
                    <p>President Boca has been granted by Congress a leave of absence from the
                        capital for two months. About the first of next month he will proceed to
                        Santa Fé, to inaugurate the railroad just finished from Santa Fé the capital
                        of the province, to the city of Rosario, and then he will proceed to his
                        native province, Tucuman.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The annual session of the Argentine Congress
                        was opened today, with all the accustomed formalities, by the President
                        reading his message to both houses assembled in the Chamber of Deputies.</p>
                    <p>The President congratulated Congress that its session opens in the midst of
                        peace and order and free from foreign difficulties and internal troubles,
                        and the country that it has entered into a regular channel in the exercise
                        of federal institutions and liberty, no longer incumbered by mutiny and
                        disturbance.</p>
                    <p>The message is quite long, but it contains a plain, clear statement of facts
                        in relation to all the departments of Government.</p>
                    <p>The President, in dealing with the subject of colonization, expresses himself
                        in favor of making effective the promises of the law of 1876 by Government
                        aid in founding colonies in the remote parts of the national territory, and
                        states that during the year 1883 73,240 immigrants, nearly all farmers,
                        landed in this country, at their own expense, over 19,000 in the first
                        quarter of the current year, and he looks forward to the arrival of 80,000
                        immigrants before the end of 1884.</p>
                    <p>In relation to the extension and construction of railways, the President
                        informs Congress that they have proceeded with great activity, and he makes
                        special mention of the railway to Bahia Blanca, which has put the capital in
                        direct communication with the first of ports on the Atlantic, crossing a
                        vast belt of fertile land which till lately was overrun by the Indians of
                        the prairies; and, notwithstanding the great difficulties encountered in the
                        construction of the Andine Railway, the rails had reached the foot of the
                        mountains, and the road would soon be opened to the public service.</p>
                    <p>It appears from the message that within the last year 1,249 kilometers of
                        telegraph lines have been constructed, and that the postal revenue increased
                        22½ per cent, over 1882.</p>
                    <p>Under the head of foreign affairs the President states that the Republic is
                        in the most perfect peace; that the foreign ministers here, by their rank
                        and personal prestige, do very much towards strengthening the friendly
                        relations which his Government cultivates with all nations; that it appears
                        that the west coast struggle has finally closed most disastrously for the
                        conquered; that the Republic strictly adhered to the strict neutrality
                        policy which was adopted on the breaking out of the war; and that in a few
                        days he would receive the new Peruvian minister sent by the Government of
                        General Iglesias, who, to his mind, possesses all the attributes to entitle
                        him to be duly received and acknowledged.</p>
                    <p>In treating on the subject of finance the President says it is with pleasure
                        he informs Congress that this branch of the administration marches hand in
                        hand with the progress and development of the country; that the Government
                        bonds have reached the very highest quotations, and that the debt is well
                        consolidated in the European market.</p>
                    <p>The general revenue of the nation for the year 1883 amounted to $30,050,195,
                        which amount, when compared with that of 1882, shows an increase of 12½ per
                        cent.; also, that the account for the first three months of the present year
                        proves that the increase has not only been sustained but considerably
                        developed.</p>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0103"/>
                    <p>The expenditures during 1883 amounted to $29,388,761, being $666,434 less
                        than the total revenue.</p>
                    <p>The aggregate tonnage of the foreign trade was 3,696,413 tons of goods and
                        products, which represent, according to official valuation, $147,596,000,
                        being an increase of nearly $26,000,000 over the former year.</p>
                    <p>The imports have exceeded the exports, but that has been caused by the heavy
                        importation of materials for the making of ports and railways.</p>
                    <p>The consolidated debt at the end of 1883 was $106,427,311, and its service
                        has always been attended to with the greatest punctuality.</p>
                    <p>The sum coined for the Government by the mint: Gold, 1,195,295 pieces,
                        representing $5,976,452; silver, 9,064,380 pieces, representing
                        $2,710,639.50; copper, 2,370,536 pieces, with a value of $38,470.39.</p>
                    <p>After treating on the subject of public instruction, normal and common
                        schools, to which the Government has given much attention, and which are
                        rapidly increasing and are well supported, the President closes his message
                        by stating “he has just finished reading his message with the satisfaction
                        of the purest patriotism, and to a certain degree with pride, not for the
                        progress already achieved, which as yet is but faintly traced as a nation,
                        but as the happy augury of a very grand future for the Argentine-Republic,
                        as we often in the morning clouds catch a glimpse of the grand mountains not
                        far off. It would neither be just nor pious for him to conclude the solemn
                        act without offering up gratitude to the Almighty for the moral and material
                        favors which His infinite kindness has showered down on the country.”</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The clerical question, or the struggle between
                        church and state, has again come to the front and is occupying much
                        attention both in and out of Congress.</p>
                    <p>In the normal schools, established and supported by the National Government,
                        are employed many Protestant teachers, mostly ladies from the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>On the 25th of April last, Dr. Clara, a Catholic ecclesiastic and acting
                        bishop at Cordova, issued a pastoral letter prohibiting, among other things,
                        the parents of families from sending their children to the normal schools
                        where Protestant teachers are employed.</p>
                    <p>The National Government, considering it an act of disrespect and
                        insubordination, took up the matter, and, after the exchange of several
                        notes between the minister of education, the governor of the province of
                        Cordova, and Dr. Clara, referred it to the attorney-general for his
                        opinion.</p>
                    <p>The report of the attorney-general is extensive and a full review of the
                        relations of the state and the church, in which he gives the opinion that
                        the Government, which confirmed church nominations, could discipline and
                        dismiss.</p>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0104"/>
                    <p>The President, accepting this opinion as sound doctrine, issued his decree
                        dismissing Dr. Clara. This has been followed by a sharp discussion in the
                        press and in Congress on a resolution calling for all the correspondence and
                        protests by the authorities of the church, charging priestly subversion on
                        the one side and encroachment and persecution by the civil authorities on
                        the other.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding the decree, Dr. Clara refuses to accept his dismissal,
                        continues to exercise the functions of his priestly office, and has, within
                        the last few days, issued his second pastoral, in which he asserts that it
                        is his first duty to obey instructions from Rome, rather than the orders or
                        laws of the National Government, which brings the whole matter to a simple
                        but sharp issue.</p>
                    <p>I have no doubt the Government will maintain its position of supremacy, and
                        it will lead sooner or later to a final result—the separation of church and
                        state.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Liberal party claims to have achieved a
                        splendid triumph in Congress to-day over the Clerical party.</p>
                    <p>At the last session the Chamber of Deputies passed a bill providing that in
                        the schools of the national capital there should be no sectarian test or
                        teaching. The Senate rejected the bill, and the matter went over until the
                        present session.</p>
                    <p>The Chamber of Deputies insisted upon its bill by a vote of forty-eight to
                        eight; as the Senate to-day could not reject by a two-thirds vote, with the
                        approval of the President, which it will doubtless receive, it will become a
                        law.</p>
                    <p>In case of a disagreement of the chambers, the proceedings differ from ours.
                        Here, either chamber of Congress having passed a bill which the other
                        chamber disapproves, may insist upon its passing, and in such case it
                        becomes a law unless two-thirds of the other and disapproving chamber should
                        reject it.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 10th instant, last night, terminated
                        the discussion in the Chamber of Deputies of the National Congress on the
                        budget of the minister of education and worship, by a vote of thirty-six to
                        twenty-three In favor.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0105"/>
                    <p>A hot debate took place on the section relating to the suppression of the
                        seminaries for the education of priests, in which the minister, De Wild,
                        took part.</p>
                    <p>Heretofore provisions were made in the budget for the support of the
                        seminaries, but the question recently having been raised as to the supremacy
                        of church or state (by Dr. Clara, acting bishop of Cordova, who was
                        suspended and replaced by a Catholic congress assembled in this city, and
                        more recently by the bishop of Salta, who issued a pastoral letter of the
                        same tone and tenor as that of Dr. Clara, and whom the President has
                        suspended pending the consideration of his case by the attorney-general),
                        and alleged intermeddling with the public schools on the part of the
                        apostolic legate, Dr. Maltera, “archbishop of Irenopolis” (and of whom the
                        minister of foreign affairs, several days ago, asked for an explanation of
                        his conduct), has caused already a division of the people into two parties,
                        clerical and anticlerical, and it is quite probable that the next
                        Presidential contest will be fought out on that issue if it be not settled
                        before, and I am inclined to think it will.</p>
                    <p>It appears from the remarks of the minister that the President, by
                        withholding supplies, is determined to press the matter to a separation. He
                        appears to be fully supported by all his ministers and the more thoughtful
                        of all the prominent men of the country.</p>
                    <p>The supporters of the church seem to labor under the mistake that the church
                        is superior to or equal with the state, or that the church is a state
                        church, whereas in the framing of the constitution the question was
                        compromised by inserting an article making it incumbent on the Government to
                        support inclusively the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
                    <p>The church press is bitter, and the feeling is intense, and while many
                        apprehend that serious trouble will result, I am inclined to believe that
                        the Government has the elements of power so well in hand that the church
                        will quietly submit, or that, by common consent, the constitution will be so
                        amended as to permit both parties to care for and support themselves, which
                        event, in my judgment, is close at hand</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that on the
                        14th instant, by orders of President Roca, the minister of foreign affairs
                        sent to Dr. Maltera, apostolic delegate, his passport, and fixed the period
                        of twenty-four hours for his leaving the national territory.</p>
                    <p>Maltera received his passport at 3 p.m. on the 14th, and left Argentine
                        territory at 3 p.m. on the 15th instant for Montevideo.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Maltera had been called upon by the minister of foreign affairs for
                        explanations relating to his interferences with the laws and authorities of
                        the country in an interview or conference with Miss Clara Armstrong,
                        directress of the normal school of Cordova, which she had reported to the
                        minister of worship. Maltera did not give the explanations.</p>

                    <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0106"/>
                    <p>The press, save the church organs, approves of the prompt measures adopted by
                        the President, and charges that Maltera has been the cause of all the
                        disturbances which now agitate the country; and it appears quite probable
                        that the press is correct, as the agitation over the school and church
                        question began very soon after the arrival of Maltera.</p>
                    <p>The subject of the conference between Maltera and the directress of the
                        school was that the normal school of Cordova had been anathematized because
                        the Government had employed Protestant teachers to teach the sciences. The
                        directress, an American and a Protestant, with other teachers, called on
                        Maltera and asked him to remove the anathema. Maltera consented to do so on
                        condition that the directress would obtain certain promises from the
                        minister of worship.</p>
                    <p>To the letter asking these pledges of the minister was returned a sharp
                        reprimand, informing Miss Armstrong that she was employed by the Government
                        to teach the sciences; that she was to obey the instructions of the minister
                        and not Dr. Maltera; that Dr. Maltera had no authority to interfere with the
                        schools.</p>
                    <p>It is quite probable that the President sent in a message asking the present

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received, through the United States
                        consul-general at this place, from the consul at Buda-Pesth, the papers
                        relating to the case of Anton Wurglitz and his sons, who have been claimed
                        for military service, with the request that the minister of the United
                        States interpose to protect him and his sons from the requisitions of the
                        Hungarian Government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Anton Wurglitz, a native and citizen of Hungary, in 1851 emigrated to the
                        United States, and resided there until 1867, having in the i mean time
                        obtained letters of naturalization; but in 1867 he returned with his family
                        to Hungary, where he has resided to the present time. While in America he
                        had three sons born, whom he took with him to Hungary from the United
                        States, viz, Ludwig, born in the city of New York, July 16, 1855 Atilla, who
                        was born in Sullivan County, New York, March 30, 1859; Anton, born in the
                        same county, March 26, 1863.</p>
                    <p>Wurglitz purchased lands in the county of Vas, in Raba-Szent Mihaly, and has
                        carried on his farm there for the last fifteen years, paid taxes, and would
                        seem to have been regarded by the citizens and officials as a burger or
                        citizen of Hungary. His name was placed upon the list of voters, and in 1879
                        he was elected mayor of the town in which he was then residing and where he
                        now resides, and, though he says he protested <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7"
                            facs="0107"/>against it, he accepted the office and was mayor or
                        presiding officer of the community for one year.</p>
                    <p>In 1880 Wurglitz wrote a letter to the United States minister at Vienna, Mr.
                        Kasson, stating to him that he emigrated to the United States in 1851,
                        became a naturalized citizen in 1856, returned to Europe in 1867, having had
                        children born in the United States, and since 1869 had lived as a farmer in
                        Hungary that his son Atilla, born in New York in 1862, wished to return
                        there soon to live, and that all his children wished to return there soon to
                        live in their “native land.”</p>
                    <p>On this statement Mr. Kasson directed passports to be issued, and expressed
                        the opinion that the United States citizenship of the family continued,
                        though the father did not appear to intend personally to return to America.
                        (See inclosed letter of Mr. Kasson to Anton Wurglitz of December 24, 1880,
                        and letter of Mr. Kasson to Mr. Evarts of same date, published in <ref
                            target="frus1881#pg_30">Foreign Relations of United States for 1881,
                            page 30</ref>, and the answer thereto by Mr. Blaine of March 31, 1881,
                            <ref target="frus1881#pg_52">page 52</ref>.)</p>
                    <p>He and his family have not returned to America, but have continued to reside
                        in Raba-Szent Mihaly; nor, has he or either of his sons obtained a passport,
                        as advised by Mr. Kasson. (See letter of Mr. Kasson.) He attempted to
                        register their names in the office of the consul at Buda-Pesth as American
                        citizens in 1880, soon after the correspondence with Mr. Kasson, and failed
                        to have it done, because he had not his naturalization papers, and the
                        consul, for that reason, would not allow it. In 1882, however, through the
                        aid of the consul, he obtained a copy of his certificate of naturalization
                        from Washington, and then, I suppose, did have himself and sons registered
                        as American citizens on the book of the consul.</p>
                    <p>In December, 1879, the Diet of Hungary enacted a law by which (section 48) it
                        was provided— <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>That those persons should be considered Hungarian citizens who had
                                lived in the territory of the provinces of the Hungarian crown, up
                                to the coming in force of said law, at least five years without
                                interruption, and were received in a native community in the list of
                                taxpayers, when they do not prove within one year, reckoning from
                                the coming in force of this law, before that district bureau or town
                                magistrate in whose territory their last place of residence is, that
                                they have retained their foreign citizenship.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>In 1883 his son Anton, who had arrived at the age of twenty years, when by
                        the law of the Empire a citizen of Hungary is liable to military duty, was
                        summoned for that purpose, and his father protested on account of his
                        American citizenship. His case was, through the consul at Buda-Pesth,
                        presented to Count Tisza, the secretary of the interior and
                        minister-president of Hungary, who, upon the statements and evidence
                        submitted, and such investigations as he deemed necessary, concluded that
                        Wurglitz had renounced his American citizenship and was a citizen of
                        Hungary, under the treaty existing between the United States and
                        Austria-Hungary, and that, as the domicile and citizenship of minor children
                        follows that of their father, their sons are citizens also of Hungary, and
                        subject also to military duty under the laws of the Empire.</p>
                    <p>An order was accordingly issued by the Hungarian Government, December 28,
                        1883, to the chief officer of the county, declaring that Anton Wurglitz,
                        together with his minor sons, Atilla, Anton, and William, were Hungarian
                        citizens.</p>
                    <p>From the statement and opinion of Count Tisza it appears that not only did
                        Wurglitz make no proof and give no notice to the authorities in Hungary, as
                        this law of Hungary required, but that none of the county or municipal
                        officers had any knowledge that he claimed to retain his <pb n="8"
                            xml:id="pg_8" facs="0108"/>American citizenship; that be had been
                        regarded as a citizen of the county where he resided, had his real estate
                        there, had his name in the list of tax-payers and in the list of voters, was
                        elected chief magistrate of the town, accepted the office and performed its
                        duties for the year 1879; that he had claimed and enjoyed the privileges of
                        a Hungarian citizen for many years, and that this course continued until his
                        sons came to the age of military duty.</p>
                    <p>The question to be determined is, whether under this state of facts the
                        Government of the United Stated is bound to interpose and protect the sons
                        of Anton Wurglitz from the performance of military duty in Hungary.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that this question must be answered in the negative.</p>
                    <p>I infer from the statement of Wurglitz that, if he had property in America,
                        he had sold it, and come to Hungary, the place of his origin, and purchased
                        a farm, on which he reared and educated his children. He was beyond the
                        reach of the American Government, so that no duty toward that Government
                        could be enforced against him. Twelve years he lived in Hungary without
                        giving any notice that he claimed to be an American citizen, had his
                        property there, was on the tax-list and paid taxes, was put upon the list of
                        voters and voted, as appears from his letter just received in answer to my
                        inquiry on the subject. In 1879, the very year in which by the Hungarian law
                        he was required to give notice to the Hungarian authorities that he had
                        claimed foreign citizenship, he was discharging the duties of the office of
                        burgomaster, to which he had been elected by the voters of the town in which
                        he resided. His statement to Mr. Kasson in 1880 left out the important
                        circumstance that he was at that time a voter in the county where he
                        resided, and holding office. Another circumstance showing a different case
                        from that which he presented to Mr. Kasson in 1880 is that, although he
                        informed Mr. Kasson that his sons considered America as their home, and were
                        soon going to America, neither he nor either of them have gone, but they
                        have chosen to incur the risk of being claimed as soldiers here rather than
                        go to America.</p>
                    <p>I have taken legal advice, and have myself examined the laws of Hungary as to
                        the question whether citizenship is a necessary prerequisite to voting and
                        holding office in Hungary. The conclusion is that the statutes of Hungary
                        require that all voters should be citizens. Some classes of citizens are not
                        entitled to vote, but voters must be citizens. The fact, therefore, that
                        Wurglitz voted at the elections of members of the National Legislature and
                        at local elections, and held the office of presiding officer of the town, is
                        incompatible with his claim to retain his American citizenship.</p>
                    <p>Nor can we overlook the circumstance that the Government of Hungary, in whose
                        jurisdiction he had voluntarily placed himself, provided a mode in which he
                        could assert his foreign citizenship, and declared that unless such
                        provision was complied with he should be considered and treated as a citizen
                        of Hungary. He had totally failed to comply with the requisitions of that
                        law.</p>
                    <p>Meantime he and his sons have been judicially declared by the authorities of
                        Hungary, in whose jurisdiction they were, to be citizens of Hungary, and
                        that declaration was made by the secretary of the interior and
                        minister-president, who is by the law of Hungary authorized to decide such
                        questions.</p>
                    <p>I conclude, therefore, that Wurglitz has so far renounced his American and
                        resumed his original Hungarian citizenship, within the meaning of article 4
                        of the treaty of September 20, 1870 (17 U. S. Statutes <pb n="9"
                            xml:id="pg_9" facs="0109"/>at Large, 836), “as to absolve the Government
                        of the United States from the obligation to protect him as a citizen while
                        he remains in his native land.”</p>
                    <p>The sons are minors, or if either of them has attained his majority it has
                        been in Hungary, and their condition as to citizenship and allegiance must
                        be held to follow that of their father. It is not necessary to decide what
                        would be the condition of Wurglitz and his sons if they were actually in the
                        United States with the purpose of there remaining.</p>
                    <p>Without desiring to prolong this dispatch, I wish only to add, that I have
                        found the Government of this realm candid and just in meeting the questions
                        arising under the naturalization treaty.</p>
                    <p>While, therefore, I would maintain with energy and decision the rights of our
                        foreign-born citizens under the treaty, I am reluctant to insist upon such a
                        construction of the provisions of the treaty as may facilitate the
                        accomplishment of a fraud upon either Government, which certainly was not
                        intended by either.</p>
                    <p>I should have acted upon the view of this case which I have herein expressed,
                        and so answered the communications of Wurglitz and the consul at Buda-Pesth,
                        had it not appeared from the letters of Wurglitz that he had written to you
                        on the same subject, and, as I am not fully informed what papers he may have
                        submitted to you, and as I should be unwilling to come in conflict with any
                        opinions which you might come to upon the statement he may have made, I have
                        thought it expedient to communicate my view of the case to you in the first
                        instance for your approval or correction.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report the case of Vitus
                        Taxacher, who was released from military service here on my application. The
                        principle on which the case turns had been recently discussed with the
                        foreign office of this Empire, but I think that this is the first case which
                        has arisen where the facts directly involved the point and were acted
                        upon.</p>
                    <p>Taxacher was summoned for examination for military service, being of the
                        proper age, and was found not then competent, but was ordered to return in
                        one year for further examination. During that year he emigrated to America,
                        and there remained long enough to be naturalized.</p>
                    <p>Afterwards he came back to his native home in Austria to visit his relations,
                        where he was immediately enrolled in the Austrian army and made to serve as
                        a soldier.</p>
                    <p>After he had been some months in the service, he, through an attorney,
                        applied to me to know whether he had any remedy.</p>
                    <p>I presented the case to the foreign office in a dispatch, a copy of which I

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: There has been presented to
                            the undersigned, minister of the United States of North America, a
                            complaint, which is herewith inclosed, asking the undersigned to apply
                            to the Austro-Hungarian Government for the release from military service
                            in the Austrian army, of Vitus Taxacher. The case, as stated, is that
                            Taxacher, at the age of nineteen, in the month of April, 1874, was
                            examined before this Government for military service and found
                            incapable, but ordered to return a year after for a second examination;
                            that during the year he emigrated to America, and there, remained eight
                            years and became duly naturalized as an American citizen, as evidenced
                            by the duly authenticated certificate of his naturalization, which is
                            herewith inclosed. That in June, 1883, he returned to visit his father
                            in Bohemia, where he was arrested and subjected to military service, and
                            has been several months so detained against his will.</p>
                        <p>I respectfully submit that under the provisions of the treaty of
                            September 20, 1870, he is entitled to be released, as he was not at the
                            time of his emigration enrolled as a recruit, nor did he fall within any
                            other of the conditions of clauses 1, 2, 3, of Article II of said
                            treaty, which enumerate the cases in which an American naturalized
                            citizen who has emigrated from Austria-Hungary can be called to account
                            on his return to this Empire for a violation of his military obligations
                            to this Government.</p>

                            of America, has acquired his citizenship there in the year 1881, a fact

                            enrolled him in the army; that in consequence thereof, and in conformity

                            74, ex. 1881), he has been discharged from the ranks of the

                        has adopted measures to put a stop to Mormon proselytizing, and that the
                        Vienna police have been ordered to arrest all Mormon missionaries engaged in

                        dated July 28 last, and have to day called upon his excellency Count
                        Kalnoky, the secretary of foreign affairs, from whom I learn that the laws
                        of the Empire prohibit the going round of agents for the purpose of
                        proselyting to Mormonism and leading people away under that pretext, and
                        that the Government enforces the law whenever it finds that it has been or
                        is likely to be violated.</p>
                    <p>This Government sympathizes with that of the United States in its efforts to
                        put a stop to the bigamous practices of the Mormons in the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>I have, therefore, as instructed by your dispatch, communicated to the

                        measures taken by this Government, by a letter of this date, inclosing a
                        copy of yours, to which this is an answer.</p>
                    <p>Count Kalnoky remarked, in the course of the interview, that he did not think
                        that there were many persons in this Empire who were led away by the Mormon
                        superstition.</p>

                        7, I have the honor to report that on the 15th instant I called upon Count
                        Szogyényi, chief of section at the ministry of foreign affairs, and drew his
                        attention to the matter treated of in the above instruction, namely, the
                        reported action of the Austrian authorities to repress the proselytizing
                        efforts of Mormon emissaries to obtain recruits in this country with a view
                        to their emigration to the United States. My predecessor, Mr. Taft, who
                        received from the Department similar instructions in your <pb n="12"
                            xml:id="pg_12" facs="0112"/>No. 89, dated July 28, had already taken

                        Frelinghuysen, dated August 12.</p>
                    <p>In my interview with Count Szogyényi I remarked that, if convenient, I would
                        be glad to have furnished me a written authoritative statement on the
                        subject, pointing out the measures that had been adopted by His Majesty’s
                        Government for the repression of Mormon proselytizing and recruiting in His
                        Majesty’s Empire for the purpose of securing accessions by emigration to the
                        polygamous sect in the United States, and any action that may have been
                        taken by the Austrian authorities in pursuance of these measures. Count
                        Szogyényi replied that he would cheerfully furnish the desired statement,
                        which was delivered to me on the 19th instant.</p>
                    <p>I herewith inclose copy of his excellency’s note containing it, with
                        translation of the same. I also inclose copy of my reply to this note,

                        to prevent the recruiting of Mormons in this country for emigration to the

                    <p>In reply to an inquiry by the Hon. Alphonso Taft, dated August 12, whether an
                        account published by some American papers concerning measures taken by the
                        Austrian authorities against proselytizing for the Mormons was founded on
                        facts, the imperial-royal ministry of foreign affairs begs to communicate
                        the following to the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the
                        United States of America, Mr. J. M. Francis:</p>
                    <p>On the receipt of a note by Mr. Kasson, then envoy of the United States of
                        America, dated September 3, 1879, the ministry of the interior, after consul
                        ting the imperial-royal ministry for worship and instruction, directed the
                        attention of all the heads of the provincial governments to the sending of
                        Mormon agents to the different states of Europe, and called upon these
                        authorities to keep a watchful eye upon them and to issue such orders to
                        their subordinates as would suppress all possible recruiting for the Mormons
                        by all lawful means.</p>
                    <p>In accordance with this order, the police at Prague arrested, in March of the
                        present year, a Mormon agent named Thomas Biesinger, from Lehi, Utah
                        Territory, in North America, because he had persuaded people to join the
                        Mormons during his stay at Prague.</p>
                    <p>On Biesinger’s arrest, March 31, a number of Mormon books, pamphlets, and
                        periodicals were found on him, as well as a diary written in English, which
                        contained memoranda concerning his mission and its successes since he left
                        Lehi, in October, 1883.</p>
                    <p>There was also found on him, and seized, a document showing Biesinger to have
                        been appointed as chief agent of the Mormons for Austria.</p>
                    <p>On Biesinger’s trial, he was sentenced by the provincial court at Prague, on
                        May 5, 1884, to one month’s imprisonment and a fine of five florins, for
                        encouragement of a religious creed not sanctioned by the state.</p>
                    <p>The arrest and imprisonment of Thomas Biesinger, having at the time been
                        commented upon by the newspapers, has probably given rise to a cable
                        telegram to a New York newspaper touching the measures recently adopted by
                        the imperial-royal authorities for the suppression of proselytizing for the
                        Mormons.</p>
                    <p>The Imperial-Royal Government will not fail in future to watch all similar
                        attempts to enlist recruits for the ranks of the Mormons, which constitute
                        furthermore an infringement of the laws of the country, in that it is an
                        organized method of inducing people to emigrate.</p>

                        August 12, whether an account published by some American papers concerning
                        measures taken by the Austrian authorities against proselytizing for the

                    <p>In the foregoing statement of public debt is not included a sum of
                        135,300,000 florins for the redemption of the land titles, which decreased
                        during the first half year of 1884 some 5,000,000 florins.</p>
                    <p>The necessary interest on this fund is yearly over 7,000,000 florins. The
                        circulation of the paper state notes at the end of June, 1884, was
                        325,400,000 florins.</p>
                    <p>It should be understood that of the common debt Hungary is obliged to pay
                        about 30 per cent, of the interest required, and that she has her own
                        separate and distinct debt, the latest data of which, as given in the very

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit herewith a
                        summary of what is known as the general budget of Austria-Hungary for 1885,
                        which was recently submitted to the Delegations now in session at
                        Buda-Pesth. This budget embraces estimates common to both parts of the
                        Empire—Austria and Hungary—and includes for expenditures the ministry of
                        foreign affairs, the ministry of war, and the ministry of finances, only so
                        far as there are disbursements on account of the first two objects named.
                        The revenues enumerated embrace certain income taxes and receipts of
                        customs. The chief items in the common estimates are: Ministry of foreign
                        affairs, 4,330,700 florins, an increase over 1884 of 58,800 florins, the
                        increase being intended to improve the salaries in the diplomatic and
                        consular service; ministry of war, 112,973,724 florins 5 for the standing
                        army, 102,235,135 florins; navy, 10,738,589 florins, a slight variation from
                        the figures of last year. The revenues enumerated amount to only 21,590,650
                        florins, and, after deducting this amount from the expenditures, there
                        remains a balance of 97,862,860 florins to be provided for by Austria and
                        Hungary, respectively.</p>
                    <p>I also transmit herewith a summary of the budget of the Kingdom of Hungary
                        for 1885, recently presented to the Hungarian Parliament at Buda-Pesth by
                        the Hungarian minister of finance.</p>
                    <p>The royal household expenses are 4,650,000 florins; common affairs,
                        28,530,079 florins, state debts, 105,547,947 florins. The ordinary
                        expenditure aggregates 308,776,270 florins, or 10,463,358 florins more than
                        in 1884.</p>
                    <p>The chief items of the increase are 1,864,964 florins more for interest on
                        the debt (representing the interest on the paper rentes to be issued),
                        4,932,267 florins more for state railways, and 4,326,506 florins more for
                        advances to railways. The ordinary revenue for 1885 is estimated at
                        313,825,017 florins, or 15,288,915 florins more than in 1884. The total
                        expenditure is set at 337,993,528 florins, or 5,450,169 florins more than in
                        1884, and the total revenue at 326,317,695 florins, or 14,436,515 florins
                        more than this year. The deficit is, therefore, 11,675,833 florins, or
                        8,986,346 florins less than this year.</p>
                    <p>Five hundred thousand florins more than this year’s yield are expected from
                        the proceeds of the tobacco monopoly, and 200,000 florins more from salt.
                        The revenue of the state domains is less than the expenditure, the former
                        being 1,346,943 florins and the latter 3,300,836 florins, but the deficiency
                        is less than last year.</p>
                    <p>The duty on spirits is estimated to yield 3,000,000 florins more; that on
                        wines, 70,000 florins more; that on beer, 100,000 florins more; and that on
                        sugar, 400,000 florins more. The whole of the indirect taxes are expected to
                        produce 3,500,000 florins more than in 1884.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the extension of the state railways, larger returns are calculated
                        upon, and there are 3,000,000 florins less to be paid in railway guarantees.
                        The revenue from customs is, in consequence of the higher duties which are
                        soon to come into operation, estimated at 45,000,000 florins, instead of
                        25,000,000 florins.</p>
                    <p>In the complicated dual Government of Austria-Hungary three distinctive
                        financial budgets are annually constructed, namely, the common budget for
                        the two powers, the budget for Hungary in its independent <pb n="16"
                            xml:id="pg_16" facs="0116"/>relations as a state, and the budget of
                        Austria, embracing the remainder of the Empire. The latter will appear soon
                        after the assembling of the Austrian Parliament here, a few weeks hence.</p>

                            (Received August 23.)</dateline></opener>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. Schamberg, the imperial-royal
                            Austro-Hungarian consul in Pittsburgh, hoisted on the 18th instant our
                            national flag over the door of the consulate, in honor of the
                            anniversary of the birthday of His Majesty the Emperor of Austria and
                            King of Hungary. The chief of the police in the above city, Mr. Braun,
                            peremptorily ordered our consul to take the flag down, by referring to
                            local regulations which forbid the hanging out of <hi rend="italic"
                                >swinging signals</hi> as street obstructions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Schamberg, in virtue of our treaty right of 1870 (Article IV),
                            correctly refused to obey the orders, and the flag remained floating
                            till sunset.</p>
                        <p>As the facts came to my notice through newspaper reports, I was not able
                            to exercise any official interference before I got the official consular
                            report. But nevertheless I called <hi rend="italic">officieusement</hi>
                            upon the First Assistant Secretary, Mr. Davis, on the 21st August, who,
                            as usual, received me very courteously and disapproved without
                            hesitation the conduct of the chief of the police on account of his
                            ignorance, but did not think it necessary to write privately to the
                            governor of the State, being sure that the matter, while we are speaking
                            about it, will have been satisfactorily settled.</p>
                        <p>Now in possession of an official consular report which states that the
                            flag remained untouched, I should have liked to attribute the conduct of
                            the chief of the police to simple ignorance and to drop the whole
                            affair; but the further proceedings of this officer urge me to enter
                            protest against them. Having been once informed of our treaty right, he
                            should have frankly declared his ignorance of international courtesy <pb
                                n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0119"/>and to be excused of the mistake
                            he made. Contrary to that, he went so far as to sue the consul for
                            infringement of the local laws by disobeying his orders, and to demand
                            even the arrest of this gentleman.</p>
                        <p>The excuse made, as I was told, by the said chief, “that if he had known
                            the hoisting of the flag to be in honor of our Emperor’s birthday he
                            would have left unnoticed the matter,” is really childish.</p>
                        <p>We stood upon our treaty right, and it is no concern for the local police
                            to examine for what purpose we think proper to hoist our flag.</p>
                        <p>You will, therefore, be so kind, as a higher authority, to cause the
                            chief of the police in Pittsburgh, having acted officially, to be also
                            officially and severely reprimanded, and to instruct the local
                            authorities with respect of the treaty rights and international
                            courtesy; which lesson would, as it seems, do them much good and avoid
                            in future disagreeable troubles.</p>
                        <p>In brief, considering the most friendly relations which happily exist
                            between the two great powers, I venture to ask of the American
                            Government nothing more than what you would have asked of ours if the
                            Austrian police had acted in the same way in a similar case against an
                            American consul in our country.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your communication of date August 29, 1884, as also
                            communication from the Department of State, at Washington, D. C. In
                            reply to same I would respectfully rehearse the proceedings had in this
                            department to which said communications refer.</p>
                        <p>Some time in April last the commissioner of highways of the city of
                            Pittsburgh issued an order to this department to give notice to all
                            persons to remove any and all swinging signs and street obstructions. In
                            pursuance of said order all persons were so notified; among others was
                            Mr. Schamberg, who had an elbow sign extending from his premises. To
                            this order Mr. Schamberg took exceptions, and until a decision was
                            rendered by the courts of our county relating to such obstructions the
                            said sign projected from his premises. Some days afterwards it came to
                            the knowledge of the chief of police that Mr. Schamberg and his employés
                            had threatened to evade the law in some way. Soon after this came to the
                            chief’s ears the flag was placed in front of Schamberg’s premises and
                            projected across the sidewalk. Chief Braun then (thinking that was the
                            manner in which they intended to evade the law, and not knowing that it
                            was placed there in commemoration of any particular day) ordered the
                            flag to be taken down, which order was disregarded. Suit was then
                            entered by the chief of police against Mr. Schamberg for violation of
                            ordinances of the city of Pittsburgh.</p>
                        <p>Two days thereafter, Col. William A. Stone, United States district
                            attorney, who acted as counsel for Mr. Schamberg, informed Chief Braun
                            of the reason for the display of the flag, which was in honor of the
                            birthday of the Austrian Emperor. This was the first intimation Chief
                            Braun had that the flag was placed there for any ceremonial purpose,
                            whereupon he immediately ordered a discontinuance of the suit entered,
                            which was done. No hearing was ever had in the case and no fine nor
                            costs imposed; hence no injury was done Mr. Schamberg individually, nor
                            was there any insult officially expressed, implied, or intended. The
                            flag remained untouched until Mr. Schamberg himself removed it.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose herewith a copy
                        and translation of an extract from the “Independence Beige” of this evening,
                        giving, from its agricultural correspondent in Paris, a letter, in which he
                        briefly shows the much greater danger of trichinosis from German pork than
                        from any other. He also mentions the discovery of a new parasite in German
                        pork by Professor Bollinger, of Munich, which Professor Bonfik, of Breslau,
                        declares to have the most deleterious and even fatal effects on mankind.</p>
                    <p>Coming as this does from an impartial source, the extract from the
                        “Independence” is another evidence of the injustice of the crusade against
                        American pork. It furnishes reasonable grounds for the adoption of a
                        retaliatory action on our part in order to protect ourselves as well as our
                        pork.</p>

                        <p>Our pork producers, or rather those who represent them in Parliament and
                            who think that their votes maybe useful in the next election, make a
                            great fuss about trichina). But the singular thing is that they persist
                            in searching for them in the American pork, and if necessary discover
                            them, notwithstanding the reports of the scientists, which should be
                            accepted as final on this point. These learned men may vainly
                            demonstrate that the care taken in raising the American hog, that his
                            food, consisting principally of Indian corn, a plant which has not the
                            reputation of sheltering the trichinae in its tissues, lender the
                            American bog at least as healthy as the French hog. But these obstinate
                            people will not give up, and it is thus that they have succeeded in
                            springing upon the Chamber of Deputies a resolution asking the
                            Government to suspend the entry of American pork into France.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, on the other hand, they leave the doors wide open to
                            the German pork. Why? He would be very sharp who could explain this
                            anomaly, unless there is therein another evil effect of the baneful
                            treaty of Frankfort.</p>
                        <p>The fact remains, however, that if there be a dangerous hog in the world
                            capable of disturbing the security which our culinary custom of
                            thoroughly cooking our meat gives us, that hog would be the German. It
                            is he who, by rooting amongst the filth in the villages in certain
                            German provinces, has become the vehicle of the trichinae which he
                            swallows, in devouring rats, moles, and other dead animals which he
                            finds in his vagabond wanderings.</p>
                        <p>Now, do you know how much pork Germany sent us in 1883, either more or
                            less, well salted I Eleven thousand three hundred and eight quintals.
                            And the United States, which are here made to play the rôle of
                            scape-goat, 524 quintals altogether.</p>
                        <p>But here is something different—a new meat parasite in the German pork.
                            It is a small, striped mushroom (<hi rend="italic">Aktinomyces</hi>),
                            which has recently been signaled to the Medical Society of Berlin. The
                            discovery appears to be due to Professor Bollinger, of Munich, who has
                            also established the ravages which it creates in animals. Then Professor
                            Bonfik, of Breslau, proved that this parasite is easily transmitted to
                            man, to <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0122"/>whom he gives a
                            contagious disease generally mortal in its effects. The report in which
                            the latter establishes this fact was presented by him to the illustrious
                            Birchow on the twenty-fifth anniversary of his professorship. This was
                            certainly a really scientific gift, but none the less a singular
                            one.</p>
                        <p>It appears, according to Professor Bonfik, that this mushroom has the
                            most dangerous, deleterious effect on the human system, producing
                            suppurations and secondary affections of the heart and other important
                            organs.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Application having been made by the Rev.
                        Orville Reed to have a marriage celebrated at the legation between himself
                        and the daughter of an American missionary at Constantinople, I have
                        informed him that the marriage should be performed in accordance with the
                        Belgian law and section 4082 of the Revised Statutes.</p>
                    <p>I believe that under my instructions I could not do otherwise.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Reed, in his application, cites as a precedent the marriage at this
                        legation on February 21, 1882, reported to the Department by Mr. Putnam in
                        his No. 133 of February 22, 1882.</p>
                    <p>As the opinion of Mr. Leopold Orban, an official in the foreign office,
                        though doubtless correct, is not an official opinion of the Belgian
                        Government, I should hesitate to permit the performance of a marriage based
                        on that personal and informal note. Mr. Putnam seems to have shared such
                        hesitancy so far as to read to the parties’ to the marriage § XLVIII of the
                        printed Personal Instructions and Mr. Leopold Orban’s note.</p>
                    <p>The instruction No. 660, of November 14, 1874, from the Secretary of State to
                        Mr. Washburne, as published in <ref target="frus1875v01#pg_445">Foreign
                            Relations, page 445, 1875</ref>, appears to deal with just such a case,
                        where an opinion was given by an eminent counselor that “a marriage
                        contracted between Americans before the minister of the United States and at
                        the hotel of the legation is valid in the eyes of the French law.” The
                        Department of State, however, decided the marriages must be performed in
                        accordance with French law, although performed within the precincts of the
                        legation. I respectfully ask that I may be instructed whether I am to adopt
                        the course followed by Mr. Putnam, or whether my decision in Mr. Reed’s case
                        is to serve for future guidance in such matters.</p>
                    <p>Should you decide that Mr. Reed’s request should be complied with, a
                        cablegram to that effect will enable me to grant it without inconvenience to
                        him as to time.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: I have a special case to put before
                            you, and to which I ask your kind attention. Will you permit the
                            marriage of an American gentleman and lady to take <pb n="23"
                                xml:id="pg_23" facs="0123"/>place at the legation, the ceremony
                            being performed by an American missionary from Constantinople? The lady
                            is the daughter of a missionary at Constantinople and I am a clergyman
                            of the Presbyterian Church. Necessity compels me to take but a short
                            leave of absence, not long enough to go to Constantinople, but only that
                            I may go as far as Brussels and meet the lady there and return <hi
                                rend="italic">immediately</hi> to the United States.</p>
                        <p>I am encouraged to write to you by a letter which I have received from
                            James O. Putnam, esq., formerly minister to Belgium.</p>
                        <p>In it he says: “In exactly such a case as you name I submitted the facts
                            to the Belgian Government. The foreign minister replied that if the
                            parties were Americans and the marriage took place at the <hi
                                rend="italic">legation</hi>, the Belgian Government took no
                            cognizance of it. The marriage took place in presence of myself and the
                            United States consul, as required by our rules in such cases. The case
                            is recorded at length in the legation miscellaneous letter-book of my
                            time. Several marriages have taken place there under diffierent American
                            ministers. If the minister allows the marriage at the legation, I should
                            not hesitate about it.”</p>
                        <p>We hope to meet in Brussels about the last week of May. I shall sail from
                            New York before an answer from you could reach me, and so will ask you
                            to have the kindness to send your reply to London, that I may find it
                            there upon my arrival.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In answer to your letter of the 22d
                            ultimo, I have to inform you that although it was formerly customary for
                            marriages to be celebrated at the legation by an English or American
                            clergyman, of late years such marriages have not been sanctioned by the
                            Department of State’s instructions of more recent date.</p>
                        <p>The latter holds “that a marriage performed within the precincts of a
                            legation may nevertheless be deemed to be performed in the country
                            within which the legation is situated, and therefore ought in all
                            respects to comply with the requirements of the country in order to
                            insure its validity.”</p>
                        <p>The statutes of the United States provide that all marriages in the
                            presence of any consular officer in a foreign county, between persons
                            who would be authorized to marry if residing in the District of
                            Columbia, shall have the same force and effect and shall be valid to all
                            intents and purposes as if the said marriages had been solemnized within
                            the United States. (Consular Regulations, § 414; R. S., 4082.)</p>
                        <p>The statute does not authorize the consul to perform the ceremony of
                            marriage, or to countenance the doing of any act which would be, or even
                            seem to be, the violation of the laws of the country in which he
                            resides. The statute contemplates that the ceremony is to be performed
                            in his presence, but it should be done according to local law. (Consular
                            Regulations, § 417.)</p>
                        <p>The foregoing considerations, however, are held not to apply to China,
                            Japan, Madagascar, Siam, Turkey, the Barbary States, and other
                            non-Christian and semi-civilized countries in which consular courts are
                            established. (Consular Regulations, § 418.)</p>
                        <p>You will find the Belgian law of marriage set forth in “Les Codes en

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The competition of American and other foreign
                        grain with that of Belgium has caused for a number of years a great
                        depression among the agricultural classes in this country. It has reduced
                        the price of grain and has caused the owners of the land to diminish the
                        rentals of their farms, and has for a long time been the black spectre which
                        the ever-complaining agriculturist has alleged as the author of all his
                        misfortunes.</p>
                    <p>The clerical majority comprises a very large proportion of the landed
                        proprietors. Among the measures which were advocated in the recent election
                        campaign by several of the clerical speakers was one to place a customs duty
                        on imported grain.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>The matter, in my opinion, will be referred to the chambers of agriculture
                        for examination and report, and then be submitted to the action of the
                        legislative chambers.</p>
                    <p>It is a matter of much discussion in the press, and one on which the clerical
                        press cannot unite, as the commercial and manufacturing centers like Antwerp
                        and Ghent are naturally opposed to a tax upon their trade or upon so
                        important an article of their consumption.</p>
                    <p>The Liberal press have raised a vehement protest against such a measure. They
                        accuse their adversaries of advocating the imposition of the grain duty in
                        the country while opposing it in the commercial and manufacturing districts.
                        They also accuse the clericals of professing their intention not to vote the
                        measure, in order to curry favor in the cities, and that after the elections
                        of the 8th July they intend to vote it.</p>
                    <p>The amount of the tax imposed varies in the estimate of its advocates from 50
                        centimes to 5 francs, according to the zeal with which they press the
                        adoption. It is important, therefore, to consider the large interest we have
                        in this subject.</p>
                    <p>I therefore submit the following statistics of the movement of grain during
                        1882, gathered from the Belgian official publications: <table rows="8"

                    <p>The small amount passing through Belgium “in transit” indicated that the
                        present mode of shipping grain is almost entirely done through Belgian
                        intermediaries. They get the benefits of the handling, the commissions and
                        profits, and a considerable share of the freights’ insurance. The trade
                        gives employment to a large number of persons.</p>
                    <p>As affecting the Antwerp trade, we find that 682,189 tons of wheat, 75,680 of
                        rye, 177,599 of barley, 10,845 of peas, beans, &amp;c., and 162,091 of oats,
                        Indian corn, &amp;c., were imported by sea into Belgium, and 3,859 tons of
                        wheat, 22 tons of barley, 170 tons of peas, beans, &amp;c., and 183 tons of
                        oats, Indian corn, &amp;c., were exported by sea from Belgium.</p>
                    <p>Nearly all of this traffic was effected through Antwerp. It amounts to a
                        gross total of 1,112,538 tons. There is a source of revenue derived from
                        this trade which is of importance to the state, viz, the railway, river, and
                        canal freights.</p>
                    <p>The exportation of these products by rail and inland navigation amounted to
                        an aggregate of: Wheat, 300,309; rye, 92,768; barley, 49,863; peas, beans,
                        &amp;c., 7,897; oats, Indian corn, &amp;c., 72,357—523,194 tons; to which,
                        in this connection, might be added the local transportation of the amount
                        consumed in Belgium. Should Belgium tax the entry of these products, they
                        will naturally seek other channels of transportation than through her
                        territory, and thus deprive her of a very large and lucrative trade in
                        distributing them to other countries.</p>
                    <p>The political and economical considerations of the question of such a duty
                        are so vast, they involve so many issues and interests, that it would be
                        impossible to deal with them in a single dispatch, nor could they be treated
                        in a proper manner until the proposal shall have assumed a more definite
                        form.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 25th of March last there occurred in
                        the province of Ceará the celebration of an event of such great importance
                        in the history of Brazil that I deem it worthy the subject of a
                        dispatch.</p>
                    <p>This event was the liberation of an entire province from the curse of
                        slavery.</p>
                    <p>For a just appreciation of the importance of the festival a brief <hi
                            rend="italic">résumé</hi> of the history of slavery in Brazil is
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>In the beginning of the colonization of this country Portugal unloaded upon
                        these shores her criminals and social outcasts.</p>
                    <p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the spirit of emigration was not
                        sufficiently advanced in Portugal to induce the better class of people to
                        seek a home and fortune in foreign lands, and thus the first colonists were
                        men of a rather low condition in life.</p>
                    <p>For the cultivation of the soil of this country, of unsurpassed fertility,
                        slave labor naturally suggested itself to the pioneers, and a great part of
                        Africa being at that time in the power of Portugal, there commenced the
                        forced populazation of Brazil with the negroes, and “the habitat of the
                        African race was extended from the banks of the Congo and the Zambesi to
                        those of the Saint Francisco and of the Parahyba of the south.”</p>
                    <p>The traffic in slaves thus begun was carried to an almost incredible extent.
                        In the language of Joaquim Nabuco, the author of “O Abolitionismo,” “there
                        was, so to speak, a bridge thrown between Africa and Brazil by which passed
                        millions of slaves.” At one period prior to 1851 the author states the
                        figures of 50,000 per annum of imported negroes are no exaggeration.</p>
                    <p>In the first quarter of the nineteenth century there arose in Brazil the
                        feeling that something ought to be done to alleviate the condition of the
                        slave, or, at any rate, that measures ought to be taken to check the
                        infamous traffic, which at that time was conducted in a manner so revolting
                        that the details do not bear description.</p>
                    <p>The first victory for the humanitarians—abolitionism was not then dreamed
                        of—was the passage of the law of November 7, 1831, which declared free all
                        negroes and their children who should be imported into the Empire after that
                        date. This law was never executed, as thousands were imported to these
                        shores subsequent to 1831. They and their children and grandchildren are now
                        held in bondage, in utter contempt of the said law of 1831, which has never
                        been repealed.</p>
                    <p>From 1831 to 1851 occurred the diplomatic fight between England and Brazil
                        because of the failure of the latter power to execute her treaties and laws
                        in reference to slavery; then came the Aberdeen bill in England; and finally
                        the foreign traffic was broken up in 1851. From this date to September 28,
                        1871, we find the friends of the slave slowly advancing their cause.</p>
                    <p>During, the war between Brazil and Paraguay, in 1866, a decree was <pb n="28"
                            xml:id="pg_28" facs="0128"/>passed granting freedom to all the slaves of
                        the nation who might be employed in serving in the army, and titles of
                        nobility were granted to such <hi rend="italic">fazendeiros</hi> as
                        furnished slaves in numbers to the imperial army.</p>
                    <p>In 1867 the “Society of Emancipation” in France, composed of le Due de
                        Broglie, Guizot, Laboulaye, A. Cochin, le Prince de Broglie, le Comte de
                        Montalembert, Wallere, and many other distinguished men, addressed a
                        petition to His Majesty the Emperor, urging him to insist upon active
                        measures being taken in behalf of the slaves.</p>
                    <p>The credit for the suppression of the traffic with Africa, in 1851, is due
                        principally to England. In 1867 we find the leading men of France protesting
                        against the further existence of an institution so totally at variance with
                        the spirit of Christianity and civilization.</p>
                    <p>The slave power was, however, too strong at that time for His Imperial
                        Majesty, but his feelings on the subject are clearly expressed in a
                        communication made by his son-in-law, le Prince Gaston d’Orleaus, Comte
                        d’Eu, the chief of the imperial army, at the close of the war with Paraguay,
                        to the President of the Provisional Government. In this paper le Comte d’Eu
                        said, “Grant freedom to your slaves, and you will do away with an
                        institution of despotism and deplorable ignorance.”</p>
                    <p>It was at this time, 1869, that the Liberal party inscribed on its banner
                        “The emancipation of the slave,” and agitated the subject persistingly and
                        fearlessly in Parliament, in the press, and at public meetings. Finally, in
                        1871, September 28, the “Rio Branco?” law passed. It is this law that is in
                        effect to-day, and on the subject of which there is now going on in
                        Parliament and elsewhere so much discussion. It was not solely the work of
                        the Liberal party, but it was a compromise measure, as a perusal of its
                        contents clearly indicates. The effort was made to satisfy the abolitionists
                        by decreeing that after September 28, 1871, no one could be born into the
                        condition of slavery in Brazil; and it was hoped that the slave-owners would
                        acquiesce quietly in the measure, as it did not affect their interest in
                        slave property existing at the time of the passage of the act.</p>
                    <p>The law is of peculiar interest, because it is the last legislative act on
                        the subject of slavery passed by a civilized nation, and in all probability
                        it will remain the last.</p>
                    <p>The legal status of the Brazilian slave is set forth in a work entitled
                        “Promptuario das Leis de Manumissão,” containing 394 pages, and from this
                        book I quote a few articles to elucidate in a measure the present state of
                        the question: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            <p>The children of slave mothers that shall be born in the Empire after
                                the date of this law shall be considered of free condition.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Section</hi> 7. The said children will remain in
                                the power and under the authority of the masters of their mothers,
                                who (the masters) will be obliged to bring them up until they have
                                completed eight full years.</p>
                            <p>The child of a slave mother arriving at this age, the master of the
                                mother shall have the choice either to receive from the state an
                                indemnification, of 600 milreis, or to utilize the services of the
                                child until it has completed twenty-one years of age.</p>
                            <p>The pecuniary indemnification fixed above shall be paid in 6 per
                                cent, bonds, to run for thirty years.</p>
                            <p>If a slave mother obtains her freedom, she takes with her her
                                children under eight years of age.</p>
                            <p>Masters who maltreat such children will be deprived of their
                                services, and these children, as well as those given to the state in
                                exchange for the indemnification, will be intrusted to the
                                associations authorized by the Government, who will take care of
                                them and instruct them in some useful trade or occupation.</p>

                    <p>The emancipation fund is derived from— <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The tax on slaves; subscriptions, legacies, &amp;c.; six annual
                                lotteries; fines from the violation of this law, &amp;c.</p>

                    <p>The judges of the orphans’ courts in each province have control of the
                        fund.</p>
                    <p>The same law requires all the slaves to be registered. From these
                        matriculated slaves the said judges draw the names of the fortunate ones who
                        are freed at the expense of the fund. The law also provides for estimating
                        the value of slaves to be freed, by creating a board of assessors.</p>
                    <p>By article 6 all the imperial slaves are declared free.</p>
                    <p>The friends of the slave are now demanding for him unconditional and
                        immediate freedom. They say that, according to the records of the <hi
                            rend="italic">fazendas</hi> apparently no children, were born of slave
                        mothers just after the 28th of September, 1871, while the lists show an
                        unheard-of increase of births for 1870.</p>
                    <p>Thus the first cause for complaint is the alleged falsification of the
                        records by the slave-owners. In the matter of matriculation and assessment
                        great abuses are likewise said to exist.</p>
                    <p>Only a very few masters choose to deliver to the Government the children born
                        of slave mothers since September 28, 1871, and to receive the bond entitling
                        to 36 milreis a year for thirty years, while the legal requirement of
                        instructing these children has in but a few eases been performed. In
                        consequence of this his highness le Comte d’Eu has only recently organized a
                        society to look after these children, full provision for whom it was thought
                        had been made in the law of 1871.</p>
                    <p>The returns for June 30, 1882, which are the latest, give as the number of
                        slaves in the Empire at that date 1,346,648. Add to this the number of <hi
                            rend="italic">ingenuos</hi> (children born of slave mothers since
                        September 28, 1871, are so called) which is 360,000 and over, and we have a
                        total of more than 1,700,000 beings in the condition of slavery out of an
                        entire population of only 10,100,000. In other words, it is safe to say that
                        one person out of every six in Brazil is a slave. When we take this fact
                        into consideration, and reflect upon the magnitude of interests involved, it
                        is easy to understand why the slave-owners, who constitute the ruling
                        element, will not agree to any change in the present laws affecting the
                        servile element.</p>
                    <p>During the past few years the abolitionists, who now constitute a very
                        formidable party, composed of an almost infinite number of societies all
                        over the Empire, had directed their efforts to the enfranchisement of a
                        single parish in the province of Ceará. This was accomplished with seemingly
                        no very great difficulty, and gradually parish after parish became free,
                        until on March 25 of this year the entire province of Ceará was enabled to
                        declare that not a slave remained upon its soil.</p>
                    <p>The consummation of this great work afforded the occasion for a grand
                        celebration, and both in Ceará and in Rio festivals were held by the
                        different abolition societies, at which there was great rejoicing, and the
                        pledge taken that there should be no faltering in the work until the whole
                        Empire could boast that it had at last put itself on the same footing with
                        the civilized nations of the globe.</p>
                    <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0130"/>
                    <p>When the slave-owners of Ceará became convinced that their province was to be
                        the one against which the efforts of the abolitionists were to be directed,
                        many of them sent their slaves to Eio and sold them.</p>
                    <p>In September, 1873, there were in the province 33,400 slaves; in January,
                        1881, this number was reduced to 20,000.</p>
                    <p>In the same year the <hi rend="italic">javgadeiros</hi> (raftsmen or boatmen)
                        decided that no more slaves should be transported from the province, and
                        this stopped the active export to Rio de Janeiro.</p>
                    <p>The slave-owners then realized the situation, and the price of slaves
                        declined rapidly. In this way the emancipation fund was made to do much more
                        good than it had formerly done. “The average price in the application of the
                        first quota was 437 milreis, and of the fourth 85 milreis, which shows the
                        progressive depreciatory influence of the emancipation agitation.”
                        Eighty-five milreis are about $37.</p>
                    <p>Additional funds for freeing the slaves were derived from private
                        contributions, lotteries, and 26,198 milreis contributed by the slaves
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>The population of Ceará in 1882 was 689,773 free and 31,913 slaves, or 22 to
                        1; while the province of Rio had 490,087 free and 292,637 slaves, or 1½ to
                        1; and Sao Paulo 680,742 free and 156,612 slaves, or 4 to 1; from which it
                        will be seen that Ceará was not one of the great slave-owning sections.</p>
                    <p>The task of enfranchising Ceará was rendered still more easy from the fact
                        that it is not a coffee producing province, but a grazing country. The <hi
                            rend="italic">fazendeiros</hi> claim that it is an impossibility to find
                        any being save an African slave who can stand being exposed the whole day to
                        the rays of the tropical sun, a torture that the laborer must undergo in the
                        cultivation and the picking of the berry.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty the Emperor said, on opening the present Parliament: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>A Government bill asking you to pass measures in regard to the slave

                            <p>This is a grave matter, but one whose final solution will be arrived
                                at by the execution of the system of the law of September 28, 1871,
                                and the Government is sure that for its development you will adopt
                                the measures suggested by your wisdom.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>That is to say, the Government advises the execution of the law of 1871 now,
                        twelve years after its passage, as a means of extricating itself from this
                        “grave matter.”</p>
                    <p>And it is indeed a grave matter for this country. Assassinations of masters
                        and overseers by slaves, followed by the most terrible revenge, are becoming
                        more and more frequent.</p>
                    <p>Brazil is bidding for immigrants to open up her wonderful resources; but
                        immigrants are not to be found who are willing to offer their labor in
                        competition with that of slaves. Her finances are a source of increasing
                        uneasiness; but every one knows that the worst has not been reached yet,
                        which will come on that day when the country finds her industries totally
                        paralyzed through the want of labor, her slaves having acquired their
                        freedom either by some legal enactment or as the result of a servile
                        insurrection. After that, freed of this terrible incubus, starting anew with
                        the principles that underlie all civilized nations, she ought soon to attain
                        that rank among the powers of the globe for which nature has evidently
                        destined her.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: One of the causes of the downfall of the late
                        ministry of Seiilior Lafayette was his expressed determination to carry into
                        effect the law of June 28, 1870. This law orders that the realty of the
                        monastic orders shall be sold and the proceeds invested in national stock.
                        It guarantees to the orders the interest accruing on said investment during
                        the lifetime of the members, and concludes by stating that the conversion is
                        to take place within ten years.</p>
                    <p>Over thirty years ago a law was passed prohibiting the creation of any new
                        monastic orders, and forbidding any of the then existing orders to take in
                        any new members after that date. All the realty held in mortmain by the said
                        orders would, on the death of the last member of each order respectively,
                        revert to the state.</p>
                    <p>At the present time many of the orders are reduced to four, three, and even
                        one surviving member. It is the intention of the Government to provide for
                        the surviving members during the remainder of their lifetime by paying them
                        yearly a sum of money equal to the yearly income the property taken from
                        them ought to yield at a fair valuation.</p>
                    <p>Those orders having schools or hospitals in connection with their monasteries
                        are exempt from the operation of the law.</p>
                    <p>Many of the orders have maladministered their property, in some instances
                        squandering their funds in dissipation. Valuable city property come to them
                        by legacy has been allowed to go to ruin by neglect, rendering the general
                        improvement of the city in the vicinity of such property impossible.</p>
                    <p>The orders doing good, those having schools and hospitals, are to be left
                        undisturbed, while the other class is to be deprived of the further control
                        of its property.</p>
                    <p>In December last the late ministry appointed a commission to convert the said
                        property. The first step taken by the commission was to order persons
                        renting houses from the orders to pay the rent which would fall due at the
                        end of the year to the agents of the commission. The tenants then found
                        themselves threatened with eviction on default of payment both to the agents
                        of the commission and to the agents of the religious orders. At this point
                        the matter was brought before the proper court, and a decision was rendered
                        declaring the acts of the commission illegal. Pending the decision the
                        tenants paid their rent into the national treasury, to be subject to the
                        order of the court. Prom the treasury it was immediately taken by the
                        commission, the minister of that department giving up the money on the order
                        of the minister of the Empire. The commission is now engaged in quietly
                        making an inventory of the realty of the orders in the Empire.</p>
                    <p>The religious orders and their friends object to the execution of the law
                        now, more than thirteen years after the passage of the law, and especially
                        to the acts of the commission, proceeding as it has in defiance of the
                        decision of the court. A commission with extrajudicial powers in a time of
                        perfect peace, they claim, is an institution in violation of the
                        constitution of Brazil. When the information reached Rome of the appointment
                        of a commission to carry out the act of 1870, His Holiness the Pope promptly
                        sent his protest against what he was pleased to consider as the spoliation
                        of the church.</p>
                    <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0132"/>
                    <p>Without undertaking to give the reply of the Government, it may be safely
                        stated, I think, that the weight of public opinion is on the side of the
                        Government in this matter of the conversion of the monastic realty.</p>
                    <p>The new minister of the Empire being interpellated, very recently, on this
                        subject, replied that it was the intention of the Government to carry out
                        the law of 1870, and that the measures adopted by the previous ministry to
                        that end were fully approved.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With the growing conviction that the days of
                        slavery are numbered in Brazil, the question of immigration becomes more and
                        more vital to the Empire. It is the general belief that the slaves, when
                        enfranchised, will cease to constitute the labor element.</p>
                    <p>Admitting this, and leaving the native as a laborer out of the question for
                        the present, it is then necessary for the life of the country that a current
                        of foreign laborers should set in to Brazil to take the place of the blacks.
                        It is also held that the yield of the land will be far greater when obtained
                        with free labor than it was when worked with slaves, or than could be
                        obtained with the same element after freedom.</p>
                    <p>“During the five years (1874—’79) the state expended the immense sum of
                        $13,000,000 to promote immigration and support immigrants.”<note n="*"
                            xml:id="d25fn1">Consul-General Andrews’s report, April, 1884.</note> It
                        had contracts with the Colonization Society of Hamburg, and with
                        individuals, for the introduction of foreign labor. Three small islands in
                        the bay were purchased for the free reception and care of from 800 to 1,000
                        for a period not to exceed eight days. Transportation by rail and steamboat
                        to the provinces was offered free. In Espirito Santo, Parana, and São Pedro
                        do sue commissions were organized for allotting state land to
                        immigrants.</p>
                    <p>The efforts of the Government have been signally unsuccessful.</p>
                    <p>The number of spontaneous immigrants in 1876 was 30,000; in 1877, 29,000;
                        1882, 24,493 (official); 1883, 24,827 (official); there also came the same
                        year 1,962 under special contracts. For the month of May ultimo, the latest
                        statistics I possess, the number of immigrants was 2,806, of which number
                        329 were females. According to nationality there were 1,618 Portuguese, 655
                        Italian, 247 German, 116 Spanish, 110 French, 39 Austrian, 12 English, and 9
                        others; of these 2,806 only 204 went to the provinces to be agricultural
                        laborers or settlers. In the same month there left the Empire 777 foreigners
                        classed as immigrants, so that the actual gain for May was 2,029. The
                        Journal do Commercio, commenting upon these figures, says: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>If we except the Portuguese, who are not drawn hither by the efforts
                                of the administration, from the totality (2,806) as entered in May,
                                we have only 1,188, which certainly gives an insignificant result
                                for our system. Although we would like to say the contrary, it is
                                hut true that the current of immigration to Brazil shows no
                                increase; we fear it will decrease when we consider that of all the
                                countries now engaged in populating their territories it is Brazil
                                that offers the least inducements to the foreign laborer.</p>

                    <p>Of the 24,827, who arrived in 1883, 13,737 were transported to the provinces,
                        principally to Sao Paulo and to Rio Grande do Sul. These represent the
                        number intending to engage in working the land. The remaining 11,090 either,
                        in part, staid in Rio, returned to Europe, or went to the River Plata.</p>
                    <p>Bearing in mind that Brazil has an area equal to that of the United States
                        (excepting Alaska), and that her population does not reach 11,000,000, the
                        figures given above are discouraging.</p>
                    <p>The Government assumes all third-class passengers arriving in Rio to be
                        immigrants. This leads to some error, as occasionally numbers under this
                        head come to engage in some specific work for which they have contracted
                        before leaving Europe, and on the expiration of which they immediately
                        return with their savings.</p>
                    <p>The legal status of the immigrant is based on the law of 1879. Under it
                        contracts are authorized by the Government to be made with foreign laborers
                        for a term of years not exceeding five; provision is made for the renewal of
                        contracts; the immigrant is not allowed to substitute any one in his place
                        to fill out his term in case he is unwilling or unable to continue longer in
                        the service of the contractor; in case the contractee becomes the debtor of
                        the contractor he is obliged to remain one or two years longer in service
                        under the original contract; the contractor is permitted to summarily
                        dismiss a contractee for prolonged illness, drunkenness, or attack upon his
                        honor or that of his family, and for insubordination. There is a clause also
                        that specifies that in the absence of a specific agreement the laborer is to
                        receive half the crop in case he has a separate parcel of land allotted to
                        him.</p>
                    <p>In practice the contractor makes a specific agreement with the immigrant for
                        five years, and where there is to be a division of the crop, the immigrant’s
                        share is nearer one-fifth than one-half. The contractees find themselves so
                        much in the power of their masters that many of them run away, preferring to
                        lose their interest in the crop rather than remain longer in a condition of
                        virtual serfdom. In some cases the immigrants who engage to work on <hi
                            rend="italic">fazendas</hi> (plantations) live in the same <hi
                            rend="italic">senzalas</hi> (quarters) with the slaves, and, in almost
                        every case, as contractees they are far less independent than they were in
                        the Old World.</p>
                    <p>The subject of immigration has an entirely different aspect in Brazil from
                        what it has in the United States, Australia, and the Argentine Republic.
                        There immigration is desired to open up and develop the latent resources;
                        here the object is to replace the slave labor on land already for years
                        under a fair degree of cultivation.</p>
                    <p>Nearly the only occupation outside the large cities open to the unskilled
                        laborer arriving in Brazil is work on a <hi rend="italic">fazenda</hi>,
                        unless he can afford to wait from five to eight years before realizing
                        anything from his efforts. The staples, coffee and sugar, require on a new
                        plantation, the former five years, the latter two, before their crops pay at
                        all. Of course, precedent to this is the necessary cleaning and preparation
                        of the ground.</p>
                    <p>The importation of labor to work the land is especially desirable because
                        there is no free agricultural labor in the country. The lower classes of
                        Brazilians work only when compelled by the direst necessity, and cannot be
                        relied upon for that steady, constant labor requisite for manipulating the
                        soil successfully. The Brazilian is the offspring of either the Portuguese
                        and negro, or the Portuguese and Indian, or the Indian and negro.</p>

                    <p>One characteristic of the nation is a certain mistrust, a feeling Of
                        suspicion and dislike towards foreigners. Formerly this feeling was very
                        bitter, but it has now nearly entirely disappeared. It accounts in a large
                        measure for the fact that foreigners do not care to become naturalized; they
                        do not come as genuine immigrants, but as colonists, and remain so, never
                        becoming part of the body politic of the country. One finds here the
                        Portuguese, French, and English colonies, besides others, each retaining its
                        distinctive national characteristics.</p>
                    <p>As a way to solve the land-labor question it has been suggested and advocated
                        that the large <hi rend="italic">fazendas</hi> be divided into small farms
                        to be cultivated by the immigrants on easy terms, and that the <hi
                            rend="italic">fazendeiros</hi> (landlords) only retain direct control of
                        the mills and machinery for preparing the coffee and cane for market, such
                        machinery being far too expensive for the immigrant to possess. The field
                        work would then be under the management of the men who perform it, while the
                            <hi rend="italic">fazendeiros</hi> would control the more advanced
                        stages in the manipulation of the crops. It is probable some such plan as
                        this will have to be adopted when the negroes are freed.</p>
                    <p>Brazil cannot expect a really desirable class of laborers to come to her
                        until slavery is abolished, until all religious orders are put on the same
                        footing, and until more satisfactory immigration laws are enacted.</p>
                    <p>The question of immigration to this Empire is of great import to the
                        countries of the Old World looking for an outlet for their surplus
                        population. The interest the United States takes in the subject is, of
                        course, of a different nature, it being the earnest, sincere desire to see a
                        friendly power succeed in its plans for the prosperity of its people.</p>

                        recently its third constitution in twenty years, viz, the constitution of
                        1864, reported by Mr. Partridge in his dispatch No. 40, of the 12th of April
                        of that year; the constitution of 1871, by Mr. Biddle in his No. 13, of the

                        December, 1883. A printed copy and a partial translation of the latter are
                        transmitted herewith, and I beg to invite your consideration of a few of its
                        provisions: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        45, of the 6th and 22d December, 1879, from this legation, invited the
                        Department’s consideration of certain articles of the new constitution of
                        Guatemala affecting the rights of foreign residents of the country, and
                        conflicting with the laws of the United States and other countries, which
                        declare that the children, wherever they may be born, of their citizens and
                        subjects, retain the nationality of their parents. He also reports in the
                        same dispatches the action taken by his colleagues of Great Britain,
                        Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, at a meeting called by himself to

                        articles referred to, the constitution being at the time under discussion in
                        the Legislative Assembly. No modifications, however, were adopted, and a few
                        days later the constitution, with all of its objectionable features, was

                        contained in the constitution of Guatemala have been inserted, among them
                        the same articles relating to foreigners (5, 14, and 23) of which Mr. Logan
                        and his colleagues complained, as the following extracts will show:</p>

                        apply to the same provisions in the constitution of Salvador. After the
                        failure of the diplomatic corps to obtain any modification of the Guatemalan
                        constitution while it was being discussed in the Legislative Assembly, the

                        addressing the minister of foreign affairs the note of which inclosure No. 2

                            that my attention has been invited to the new constitution of the
                            Republic of Salvador (published in the Diario Oficial of that capital of
                            the 8th instant), and especially to its provisions relating to
                            foreigners. These provisions are identical in text or tenor with those
                            of the constitution of Guatemala of 1879, which were at the time the
                            subject of protest on the part of my predecessor, Mr. Cornelius A.
                            Logan, who, in view of his instructions, declared to the Guatemalan
                            Government that the provisions referred to affect “the plainest rights
                            of his countrymen, as well as his own faculties and prerogatives as a
                            foreign representative.”</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the same instructions, I beg leave, most respectfully,
                            to state that wherein the above-named provisions affect the rights of
                            citizens of the United States my Government will require that those
                            rights shall be respected, that their just claims shall be sustained,
                            and that redress shall be demanded in all cases in which diplomatic

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister</hi>: By your excellency’s courteous
                            communication of the 24th ultimo the Salvador Government has been
                            informed that some of the provisions of the new constitution of the
                            Republic have attracted your attention, being identical with those which
                            in 1879 were the object of the protest of one of your predecessors in
                            Guatemala, in virtue of their affecting as well the rights of your
                            fellow-citizens as your own rights and prerogatives as a foreign
                            representative. With this view, following the <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38"
                                facs="0138"/>same instructions given previously by your Government,
                            your excellency stated that wherein the provisions referred to affect
                            the rights of your fellow-citizens you will ask that they may be
                            respected and their just claims attended to in all cases in which
                            diplomatic intervention may be justified by international law.</p>
                        <p>My Government at once accepts as sincere your excellency’s courteous
                            manifestation, and although dissenting essentially in the appreciation
                            of the provisions alluded to, which, in its judgment, far from
                            impairing, recognize the rights of foreigners to the same extent and
                            under the same guarantees as of Salvadorians, has no objection to
                            declare at the same time, which it does through my medium, that in the
                            future, as in the past, it will continue to accept the diplomatic
                            intervention of foreign representatives in conformity with the treaties
                            in force and with the general provisions of international law.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In May, 1883, the Costa Rican Congress passed
                        a law making Port Limon, on the Atlantic, a free port for the term often
                        years. Ten months later, the same Congress, without giving any previous
                        notice of its intention, regardless of the foreign interests created,
                        foreign capital invested, and foreign enterprises undertaken under the
                        inducements held out by that act, repealed the law and established the
                        former tariff upon imports. I inclose copies and translations of both
                        decrees.</p>
                    <p>I inclose also an extract from a letter from Mr. Consul Morrell, with its
                        inclosure from a well-known American who has large interests in that
                        country. From these it appears that the publication and execution of the act
                        of repeal were simultaneous, the Government commencing at once to levy
                        duties on goods imported under the assurances of a free entry.</p>
                    <p>It appears also that the principal commercial interests of Limon are
                        American; that two merchants of the place are now abroad making purchases of
                        merchandise, in the full faith that it was to be a free port for ten years;
                        that, knowing nothing of the change, they will, of course, upon their
                        return, come into conflict with the Government.</p>
                    <p>Other parties were making preparations to enter into the business of raising
                        fruit for the markets of the United States.</p>
                    <p>While there may be no doubt as to the right of the Costa Rican Congress to
                        revoke the law referred to, it seems but just that some previous notice
                        thereof should have been given or a reasonable time allowed the interested
                        parties to adjust their business affairs to the new conditions. As the
                        matter now stands it has all the appearance of bad faith on the part of the
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>In view of these facts, I have deemed it my duty to instruct the consul at
                        San José to receive the protests of our citizens who may be injured in their
                        interests by the action of the Costa Rican Government, and especially those
                        who have imported goods under guarantee of the law now repealed. I have also
                        addressed a communication to the minister for foreign affairs, of which I
                        inclose a copy.</p>

                            that the law of the 22d of May, 1883, has not had the results that were
                            expected of it, but has produced grave prejudice to the customs revenue

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: * * * I invite your attention to the
                            inclosed copies of law No. 6, dated May 22, 1883, making Limon a free
                            port for <hi rend="italic">ten years</hi> from the 10th of August, 1883,
                            and of law No. 20, dated June 19, 1884, <hi rend="italic">repealing
                                it</hi>. The question arises in my mind, “How can such things be?”
                            Mr. Volio, among other arguments in support of the repeal, says, “Such
                            things are done all the world over.” His boundary of this world, if not
                            of the whole universe, is probably limited to Spain and all the
                            Spanish-American countries. Would or could the United States Congress
                            repeal a law making a certain port free for ten years, in less than one
                            year I Is not such an act on the part of Congress virtually a contract
                            entered into with the entire outside world for a specified time? As it
                            is, this country will itself be the principal sufferer. Parties with
                            large capital were already making preparations to enter into business at
                            Limon on a large scale; but in consequence of this new law they have
                            retired. But how about the houses already established there? * * * Mr.
                            Willis, Mr. Keith’s representative, promised to give me some facts in
                            regard to this matter, which I will inclose to you if received in

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Allow me to bring to your notice a great
                            piece of injustice which has been committed by the Government of this
                            Republic, in order that, should you think fit, you may bring the matter
                            before your Government.</p>
                        <p>According to a decree duly passed by Congress and sanctioned by the
                            executive power, Limon, on the Atlantic coast, was declared a free port,
                            together with a certain zone within given boundaries, for the space of
                                <hi rend="italic">ten years</hi>, counting from the 10th of August,
                            1883, as may be seen from the decree to that effect duly published in
                            the official gazette of this Republic, dated the 23d May, 1883. Since
                            the 10th August last year, in conformity with the decree, said port and
                            zone have been free, but on the 19th of this month, without any previous
                            notice or warning, the Congress have thought fit to pass a decree
                            derogating completely this franchise, which decree has been duly
                            sanctioned by the executive power and published in the official gazette
                            of 21st instant.</p>
                        <p>The Government has already commenced to collect duties on goods that have
                            arrived or are arriving, although they may have been ordered months ago,
                            in accordance with the decree which establishes the freedom or exemption
                            from customs duties for <hi rend="italic">ten years.</hi></p>
                        <p>Within the last year a new industry has very much increased in the free
                            zone, and that is the planting and cultivation of bananas by persons of
                            all nationalities, who have made their calculations upon a free port. At
                            the present time from 25,000 to 30,000 bunches a month are exported to
                            New York, which amount is daily increasing, and several projects were on
                            foot for augmenting this business with foreign capital, which was being
                            subscribed for in Boston and New Orleans on the basis of a free
                            port.</p>
                        <p>Having a contract for the development of the Atlantic division of the
                            Costa Rica Railroad for five years, any change of this kind being made
                            is extremely prejudicial to my interests, not only increasing very
                            considerably the working expenses of the railroad, owing to my having to
                            pay a higher price for labor, but also tending to diminish instead of
                            augment the receipts of banana freights, upon which I had based my
                            calculations, owing to further planting consequent on the decree
                            declaring the port and zone free.</p>
                        <p>I may mention that the principal merchants in Limon, together with
                            myself, are American citizens, as you are aware, and I think should be
                            entitled to some protection from such an arbitrary act and want of good
                            faith on the part of the Government of one country and the citizens of
                            all others.</p>
                        <p>Two of the principal merchants of Limon are at present abroad making
                            purchases of merchandise, in the full faith of a free port for <hi
                                rend="italic">ten years></hi> and know nothing of the change just
                            made, and will doubtless come into conflict with this Government, on
                            their arrival here, when duties are exacted. Having very large interests
                            at stake in <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0141"/>this country, I am
                            extremely unwilling to come into conflict with the Government, or even
                            to do anything prejudicial to its interests in any way; hut certainly I
                            think that this is a matter that should be inquired into by the
                            different Governments, in the interests of their citizens residents here
                            who may have been misled into entering into business in Limon under the
                            veil of a free port.</p>
                        <p>Trusting you will give the matter your best attention,</p>
                        <p>I am, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: My attention has been invited to the act
                            of the Costa Rican Congress of the 19th ultimo, repealing the decree of
                            the 22d of May, 1883, by which Limon was made a free port for the period
                            often years. I have been informed also that the new act was immediately
                            carried into effect, without any consideration whatever for the foreign
                            interests created under the guarantees of the former law.</p>
                        <p>While awaiting the definite instructions of my Government, to which I
                            have communicated the facts above mentioned, I am constrained to protest
                            most respectfully, in behalf of American citizens whose interests are
                            affected, against the act of the 19th of June, 1884, and especially
                            against its immediate enforcement, as also against the collection of

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of
                        your No. 241, of the 25th ultimo, respecting the decrees of the Government
                        of Costa Rica in reference to the port of Limon.</p>
                    <p>It appears that on the 22d day of May, 1883, the Congress of Costa Rica
                        passed a law declaring the port of Limon free of customs imports for a
                        period of ten years, to take effect from August 10, 1883.</p>
                    <p>It further appears that on the 19th day of June, 1884, the same Congress,
                        without giving any previous notice of its intention, repealed the law of May
                        22, 1883, and re-established the former tariff upon imports.</p>
                    <p>It also appears that the publication and execution of the act of June 19,
                        1884, were simultaneous, and regardless of the foreign interests created
                        under the inducements held out to foreign capitalists by the act of May 22,
                        1883.</p>
                    <p>You say that the principal commercial interests of Limon are American, and
                        that you have instructed the United States consul at that port to receive
                        the protest of the citizens of the United States who may have incurred
                        losses under guarantees of the act of May 22, 1883, by the investment of
                        capital, especially in foreign goods now ready for shipment from foreign
                        ports or on their way to Limon.</p>
                    <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0142"/>
                    <p>The Department fully approves of the discretion with which you have looked
                        after the interests of your countrymen in this matter.</p>
                    <p>The subject is deemed a proper one to submit, as you have already done, to
                        the sense of equity and fair dealing of the Government of Costa Rica.</p>
                    <p>Should the Government of Costa Rica, however, reply denying responsibility,
                        as of right, for the losses thus sustained, you will, without delay,
                        transmit all claims presented to you on behalf of citizens of the United
                        States and arising under the circumstances before mentioned, that is to say,
                        all claims for loss arising from transactions which were anterior to the
                        notice of the repeal of the law of May 22, 1883, accompanied by the proofs
                        in support thereof, for the consideration and action of this Department, and
                        at the same time urge upon the Government of Costa Rica the right of this
                        Government to be fully indemnified for all losses sustained by citizens of
                        the United States by reason of the repeal, without reasonable notice, of the
                        law which declared Limon a free port of entry for a period of ten years.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring you to Mr. Hall’s No. 241, of July
                        25, I have the honor to report that in a note dated at San José, August 29,
                        1884, and received at this legation on September 7, the minister for foreign
                        affairs of Costa Rica acknowledges the receipt of Mr. Hall’s note for July
                        25, and declines to consider his (Mr. Hall’s) protest against the immediate
                        application of the decree revoking the law of May 22, 1883, which made Port
                        Limon a free port for the term of ten years.</p>
                    <p>The minister alleges that the period of ten years specified had for its
                        object to fix the maximum duration of the franchise, and does not in any way
                        bind Congress to maintain Port Limon free for a whole decade.</p>
                    <p>I would add that this day I have been informed, by a telegram from a
                        trustworthy source, that a decree, dated the 5th instant, has been issued,
                        by virtue of which the “principal articles” (<hi rend="italic">articulos
                            principales</hi>) can be imported free of duty for the use of the
                        district of Limon.</p>
                    <p>By this it would appear that the Congress has modified its decision since the
                        date of the communication from the minister for foreign affairs o August 29,
                        above mentioned.</p>
                    <p>I am informed by the British minister that a like note has reached him.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my dispatch No. 241, of the
                        25th July, relating to the two decrees of the Costa Rican Government of the
                        22d May, 1883, and 19th of June, 1884, the former making Limon a free port
                        for ten years and the latter revoking the law, I have now to acknowledge the
                        receipt of your instruction No. 170, of the 20th August, relating to the
                        same subject and approving my action in protesting against the apparently
                        inconsiderate action of the Costa Rican Government. * * *</p>
                    <p>In his letter of the 1st of August, Mr. Morrell reports having transmitted to
                        the minister of foreign affairs the protest of Mr. A. K. Brown against the
                        detention by the custom-house at Limon of goods imported under the decree of
                        22d May, 1883. The consul reports also that his communication was not
                        answered, but the goods of the party were released immediately and no duties
                        charged.</p>
                    <p>Under date of the 29th August, Minister Castro replies to my note of the 25th
                        July (of which a copy accompanies my No. 241), wherein I asked that a
                        reasonable time be granted the interested parties before enforcing the
                        last-mentioned decree. He alleges the reasons why my suggestions cannot be
                        acceded to, and claims the right of his Government to revoke it at any time,
                        that the period of ten years had for its object to fix its maximum duration,
                        and in no way obligated the Government to maintain a free port at Limon
                        during a whole decade. I have replied to the minister, under date of the 22d
                        ultimo, insisting that the parties whose interests have been injured by this
                        action of the Costa Rican Government have the same right to consider the
                        period stipulated in the decree of 22d May, 1883, as fixing its minimum
                        duration, and, in consonance with your instructions above referred to, I
                        have informed the minister that the right is claimed for our citizens to be
                        fully indemnified for all losses sustained in consequence of the revocation,
                        without notice, of the last-mentioned decree.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister</hi>: I have had the honor to receive
                            your esteemed communication dated Guatemala, 25th July ultimo.</p>
                        <p>By it I have taken note that your excellency considers just and expedient
                            to decree a reasonable term for the enforcement of the decree of 19th
                            June ultimo, revoking that of the 22d May, 1883, which established the
                            freedom of the port of Limon, with the view of avoiding the claims which
                            otherwise will be presented against my Government.</p>
                        <p>I thank you for the interest you show in all that you consider favorable
                            to the commerce of Costa Rica and your desire to avoid reclamations
                            against her; but permit me to state that it is not possible to accede to
                            your wishes, not only because the opportunity of conceding the
                            reasonable term referred to is past, but also for the reasons which I
                            shall set forth.</p>
                        <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0144"/>
                        <p>The supreme executive power would have adopted the measure you suggest,
                            not as a right nor as being customary in cases similar to the one in
                            question, but out of consideration for the interests created under the
                            franchise and that were going to suffer notably, if the proximity and
                            rapidity of communications between Limon and the principal foreign ports
                            from whence merchandise is imported should not have caused fears that
                            the merchants would take advantage of the term conceded them, with the
                            sole view of avoiding greater losses, to make large importations to the
                            prejudice of the public treasury.</p>
                        <p>In addition, my Government does not believe that the enforcement of the
                            decree of June 19 referred to can give rise to just claims on the part
                            of foreigners or of nations, because it injures the rights of no one.
                            The time of ten years to which you refer had for its object to fix the
                            maximum duration of the same, and in no way obligated the legislative
                            power to maintain a free port at Limon for a whole decade, even when the
                            inexpediency of the decree of 22d May, 1883, was apparent from the first
                            month. Such interpretation is in accord with the will of the
                            legislature, and, on the other hand, is authentic.</p>
                        <p>I entertain the hope that the foregoing considerations will convince you
                            that there is no cause for the claims to which your communication
                            refers.</p>
                        <p>I improve, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge
                            the receipt of your excellency’s courteous communication of the 29th
                            ultimo, expressing dissent as to the suggestions contained in my note of
                            25th July, relative to the revocation of the decree of the 22d May,
                            1883, by which Limon was made a free port for the term of ten years.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency is correct in estimating the motives for my referred to
                            communication. It was and is my desire to avoid the reclamations which
                            might arise in consequence of (if I may be permitted to use the
                            expression) the abrupt revocation of a law under which foreign interests
                            were created, and, as your excellency admits, would be injured by such
                            revocation.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency is pleased to state also that the opportunity has passed
                            for conceding the reasonable postponement asked for, but that the
                            supreme executive power would have adopted the measure suggested by
                            me—not as a right nor as a custom in such cases, but out of
                            consideration for the interests created under the franchise which would
                            notably suffer—but for the possibility that the merchants might take
                            advantage of the opportunity to make heavy importations, to the
                            prejudice of the public treasury, to whose interests it would seem the
                            “created interests” referred to are made subservient.</p>
                        <p>If it is intended to convey the idea that my request for a postponement
                            was not in time, I beg to say that it was made immediately upon being
                            advised of the revocation of the decree of the 22d May, 1883.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the right of remonstrance, your excellency admits that the
                            interests created under the franchise would suffer notably by its
                            revocation. As to the custom in such cases, I should be glad to be
                            informed upon what precedent your excellency’s Government supports its
                            action in this case. Nor can I concur with your excellency that the
                            stipulation of the term of ten years had for its sole object to fix the
                            maximum duration of the decree of the 22d May, 1883. The foreign parties
                            whose interests have been injured by its revocation had the same right
                            to consider the stipulated term of ten years to be the “minimum”
                            duration of the decree as the Government of your excellency has to
                            consider it the “maximum.”</p>
                        <p>The Department of State of my Government, to which I have referred the
                            subject in question, authorizes me to say that it is deemed a proper one
                            to submit to the sense of equity and fair dealing of the Government of
                            Costa Rica, and I am further instructed, should your excellency’s
                            Government deny responsibility, as of right, for the losses thus
                            sustained, to transmit without delay to the Department, for its
                            consideration, all claims presented to me on behalf of citizens of the
                            United States arising under the circumstances referred to, and at the
                            same time respectfully to make known to the Government of your
                            excellency that the right is claimed to be fully indemnified for all
                            losses sustained by citizens of the United States by reason of the
                            repeal, without reasonable notice, of the law which decreed Limon a free
                            port for the period of ten years.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received a dispatch of the 13th ultimo,
                        No. 2, from Mr. Whitehouse, stating that the Government of Costa Rica had
                        declined to accept your protest on behalf of American citizens at Port Limon
                        who should actually suffer in consequence of the arbitrary repeal of the law
                        of May 22, 1883, making that place a free port for ten years from August 10,
                        1883. He also reports that, according to information which he has received
                        from a trustworthy source, a decree of the 5th ultimo has been issued
                        granting the right to import, free of duty, for the use of the district of
                        Limon, <hi rend="italic">articulos princiales</hi> (principal articles).</p>
                    <p>You will, if possible, confirm Mr. Whitehouse’s report and furnish the
                        Department with whatever information bearing upon the alleged modification
                        you can obtain.</p>
                    <p>At any rate, the situation remains practically unchanged from what it was
                        when Mr. Frelinghuysen’s instruction No. 170, of August 20 last, was sent,
                        in response to your No. 241. You will, as speedily as possible, transmit to
                        the Department the information desired by its No. 170, in order that a full
                        and definite understanding of the subject may be arrived at, and whatever
                        action may be necessary for the protection of American interests which have
                        actually suffered on account of the action of the Government of Costa Rica
                        may be speedily taken.</p>

                        your instruction No. 184, of the 13th ultimo, and to refer you in reply to
                        my dispatch No. 263, of the 1st of the same month.</p>
                    <p>As no complaints of losses sustained by our citizens in consequence of the
                        repeal of the law of May 22, 1883, making Limon a free port for ten years,
                        have yet reached this legation, there appears to be no necessity at present
                        for further correspondence on the subject with the Costa Rican Government.
                        It seems that the Government has permitted the free importation of all goods
                        that were ordered under the guarantees of the former law, and has thus, for
                        the time at least, avoided motives for complaint.</p>
                    <p>The decree of the 5th September last, referred to in your instruction,
                        granting the right to import certain articles for the use of the Limon
                        district, does not, I understand, become a law until ratified by

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In several recent dispatches I have had
                        occasion to refer to a riotous demonstration against foreigners which took
                        place at Canton upon the 10th of September last, and I have now the honor to
                        submit various papers in reference thereto, which will place you in
                        possession of all the information now in the hands of the legation upon the
                        subject. These papers consist of copies of six dispatches received from Mr.
                        Consul Seymour, and extracts from newspaper reports of the affair.</p>
                    <p>From these reports you will gather that the immediate cause of the riot was
                        the accidental or intentional drowning of a Chinese by a Portuguese watchman
                        employed on the British steamship Hankow, but that the feelings of the
                        populace had previously been roused to an intense degree by the wanton
                        murder of an inoffensive Chinese by a British subject named Logan while the
                        latter was in a state of intoxication, by the release of two of Logan’s
                        companions, and by the fear that Logan himself would either be released or
                        escape with a trifling punishment. I shall have occasion to address you more
                        at length upon this unfortunate occurrence within a few days. In the mean
                        time I may add that Iogan has been tried before a British court, convicted
                        of manslaughter, and sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment. The viceroy at
                        Canton and the foreign office here have protested against this punishment as
                        inadequate, but, so far as I can learn, without effect. The air is full of
                        rumors of further and more serious disturbances at Canton, which, however,
                        cannot be traced to any reliable source. There is much uneasy feeling among
                        the Chinese at other ports, and the situation as a whole is far from
                        reassuring.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that the
                            Europeans and Americans residing in Canton and on the Shameen have had
                            an interesting day during which some lives were lost and considerable
                            property has been destroyed, amounting in value to about $200,000, with
                            incidental damages to business of steamers and ships to enough more to
                            make a total loss of about a quarter of a million of dollars.</p>
                        <p>The immediate cause of the outbreak of the mob was the death of a
                            Chinaman this morning on board the British steamer Hankow, caused by the
                            kicks of a Portuguese employé (watchman), who killed the Chinaman, or
                            caused him to roll insensible into the water, where (it is commonly
                            alleged) he was drowned, although it is probable the man died of the
                            kicks.</p>
                        <p>Immediately thereafter the Chinese mob fired the wharf and sheds where
                            the steamer <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0147"/>Hankow was moored,
                            and would have set the steamer on fire if she had not promptly, east off
                            lines and steamed up the river in front of the Shameen or European
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>The mob, gathering strength with the excitement of the occasion, forced
                            their way quickly upon the European reservation (Shameen), and,
                            commencing with the new ice factory of Mr. Raven, which was soon
                            destroyed-, looted or pillaged nearly all of the dwellings and business
                            places, to the number of a dozen valuable buildings, east of the British
                            consulate and east of Messrs. Russell &amp; Co.’s establishments, which
                            were entered by the leaders of the mob, five of whom were captured while
                            attempting to fire the main building, from which they were ejected in
                            time to save it from destruction.</p>
                        <p>Four of the five captured persons escaped. From 8 o’clock a. m. until
                            after 1 o’clock p.m. the mob encountered no resistance worth mentioning;
                            but after live hours of pillage and incendiarism the mob were
                            interrupted by the viceroy’s soldiers, who are now in possession of the
                            Shameen and its approaches.</p>
                        <p>The steamor Hankow, instead of proceeding from Canton to Hong-Kong, has
                            remained in port, as all concerned regarded it extremely hazardous for
                            the steamer to carry away the body of the recovered Chinaman or the
                            person of the Portuguese who caused his death, no one feeling authorized
                            to act for the Portuguese.</p>
                        <p>This afternoon the body of the murdered Chinaman was removed from the
                            steamer, which is still here, awaiting action in regard to the
                            Portuguese.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time the ladies and children of nearly all of the foreigners
                            who could reach steamers in port took refuge, and still remain thereon,
                            while the citizens of western nations, to the number of about sixty
                            persons, are patrolling the Shameen, agreeably with an organization
                            effected at a public meeting in the Canton Club House at 5 o’clock this
                            evening.</p>
                        <p>The consular corps, representing the United States, Great Britain,
                            Germany, France, Denmark, and Sweden and Norway, met in the United
                            States consulate at 3 p.m. and acted unitedly in reference to the
                            emergency. A copy of the dispatch adopted by all the consular officers
                            is appended.</p>
                        <p>At present matters have apparently quieted down; but with over three
                            millions of Chinese within a radius of six miles, and over six millions
                            within a radius of twelve or fifteen miles, the materials are abundant
                            for a continuance or renewal of the deplorable scenes that have been
                            enacted this day in Canton.</p>
                        <p>I just came off my evening patrol, and return to it at 4 p.m.</p>

                            the lamentable occurrences which have this day resulted in such a

                            is due to the total want of sufficient protection to the foreign
                            settlement, and to the tardy action of the Chinese authorities in
                            sending a military force for our defense.</p>
                        <p>I must most urgently impress upon your excellency the necessity of
                            adopting stringent measures to repress incendiaries and robbers.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In various dispatches to the Department I have
                        endeavored to keep you informed as to the growth of our petroleum trade, and
                        of the policy adopted by the legation to insure its protection and
                        encouragement.</p>
                    <p>The subject came to my attention in certain correspondence with the
                        consul-general at Shanghai. That gentleman reported acts of interference
                        with the sale in Shanghai and elsewhere, especially Nmgpo. I was led to
                        apprehend that there would be a general assault upon petroleum through local
                        Chinese agencies, with which we could not interfere.</p>
                    <p>I addressed the foreign office, and from the tone of the answer of Prince
                        Kung I came to the conclusion that there was no opposition to petroleum on
                        the part of the Government; that, on the contrary, the Government was
                        disposed to encourage the trade; and that all we had to fear was the
                        ignorance of minor officials, arising out of the conservatism of the Chinese
                        character.</p>
                    <p>This opinion I expressed to the Department. But to fortify the legation in
                        its judgment, I addressed to all the consuls within our jurisdiction a
                        letter of inquiry as to the exact condition of the trade, whether it was
                        increasing or decreasing, and what had been the effect of any hostile
                        proclamations against its use on the part of the Chinese authorities.</p>
                    <p>The hope which I expressed in these dispatches has thus far been justified by
                        events, namely, that “the objections arising from ignorance and fear” would
                        exhaust themselves; that, in spite of official opposition, the trade has
                        steadily grown, especially in the interior; and that it was the part of
                        wisdom not to excite the animosity and suspicion of the authorities by undue
                        remonstrance.</p>
                    <p>The legation, in a steady pursuit of this policy, has the gratification to
                        say that we have had no report from any consular officer, with one
                        exception, indicating a desire on the part of the minor authorities to
                        interfere with the sale of petroleum. My hope is that the close of the year
                        will show an advance over the imports of last year.</p>
                    <p>The conclusion we draw from this is that petroleum is working its way into
                        the confidence of the people, and that no action on the part of the legation
                        is necessary, except to watch the course of trade and not trouble the
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>I said that with one exception the consuls had made no report indicating a
                        disposition to interfere with the trade. This exception has been found in
                        Canton. It seems from the reports of Mr. Consul Seymour that the governor of
                        Canton has granted to a local company the monopoly to sell petroleum.</p>
                    <p>I have had occasion, in my correspondence with Mr. Seymour, to deplore the
                        existence of this monopoly, as an experiment which could be of no ultimate
                        advantage to China and might in the end injure our trade. I have counseled
                        him to do what lay in his power to terminate it, but could do no more than
                        give counsel, as we had no ground for formal <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49"
                            facs="0149"/>remonstrance. After the petroleum passed into the hands of
                        the Chinese the merchants could sell it at the price they pleased.</p>
                    <p>It seems, however, that the governor, in order to increase the revenue,
                        imposed a tax upon its sale, or rather its importation into Canton, of 40
                        cents a case. Under the treaty such a tax is inadmissible, for it virtually
                        increases the impost 300 per cent. The treaty admits petroleum at a duty of
                        5 per cent, ad valorem. This additional tax quadruples that sum.</p>
                    <p>I still cherished the hope that Mr. Seymour, by personal representations to
                        the Canton viceroy, could show reasons for removing the tax.</p>
                    <p>As Great Britain, through her Hong-Kong interests, was concerned, I conferred
                        with Sir Harry Parkes, Her Britannic Majesty’s minister. In my first
                        interview with his excellency I found, to my gratification, that he was
                        disposed to act with our legation, but he was just taking charge and had not
                        time to look into the matter. In my second interview he informed me that he
                        was about to go to Corea, and would be gone for some weeks. I therefore
                        resolved to address the yamên alone.</p>
                    <p>In my note to his imperial highness I present the question in two phases.
                        First comes our undoubted right under the treaty to resent any action on the
                        part of the Government which violates the treaty, and to demand from the
                        viceroy the restoration of the sum unjustly levied, with interest upon the
                        same at the rate current in Chinese money markets.</p>
                    <p>The language of the treaty upon which I relied read as follows: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>At each, of the said five ports, citizens of the United States
                                lawfully engaged in commerce shall be permitted to import, from
                                their own or any other ports, into China, and sell there, and
                                purchase therein, and export to their own or any other ports, all
                                manner of merchandise of which the importation or exportation is not
                                prohibited by this treaty, paying the duties which are prescribed by
                                the tariff hereinbefore established, and no other charges
                                whatsoever.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>Having made this demand in the most positive manner, it seemed wise to call
                        the attention of his imperial highness to other features of the question as
                        they concerned the Chinese themselves: that the trade was an advantage to
                        China; that it interfered with no interest, was a blessing to the poor, as
                        had been found in other countries; and that any effort to stifle the trade
                        by these vicious local monopolies would be a serious loss to the imperial
                        revenues.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>The Chinese authorities are considering with care the propriety of certain
                        general rules governing the sale of petroleum, and especially the grade or
                        fire test which should be exacted from imported burning oils. In this
                        question, one of much importance, I have taken a deep interest. To impose a
                        higher test than is accepted in Japan or in European countries would injure
                        the trade.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>It would be an advantage to the petroleum trade if we could induce the
                        Chinese Government to adopt careful and at the same time not restrictive
                        rules as to its importation and sale, such as are seen in India and Java,
                        and I hope in Japan.</p>
                    <p>We have no right to interfere with the rights of the Chinese to interpose
                        proper sanitary and police regulations upon the sale or use of any article
                        that may do their people harm.</p>
                    <p>If they feel that petroleum does harm, leads to conflagrations, as has
                        happened in densely settled communities (the houses built of slender,
                        flimsy, combustible material—not houses in reality, but the camping <pb
                            n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0150"/>grounds of one generation, and only
                        intended to serve its time), we must expect opposition.</p>
                    <p>Advice and experience may control that. Better than advice and experience
                        would be for those who direct the petroleum interests at home to take
                        special pains in educating the people to handle it. * * * The burning oil
                        should not be of too low a grade. The fire test should be as safe as that
                        imposed upon oils in America.</p>
                    <p>Pains should be taken to see that the people were supplied with lamps
                        perfectly safe and at the same time cheap. This does not mean that the
                        exporters of oil should make and sell lamps, but they should see that a lamp
                        suited to the Chinese market was either made at home or the people here
                        taught to make it themselves.</p>
                    <p>And in this, those interested in petroleum must consider that China has large
                        classes of very poor people. So carefully have these thrifty, patient, and
                        ingenious people handled the conditions of life, that what you regard as
                        poverty at home would be “living in comfortable circumstances” here. To
                        supply the wants of that class should be the aim of the petroleum interest,
                        and if that problem could be solved there would be a vast trade.</p>
                    <p>In the month of December last I addressed a circular to all the
                        consulates.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>The interesting information which this dispatch elicited was of so much value
                        that, as I am hopeful of confirming the impression that there has been no
                        strenuous opposition to petroleum on the part of the local officials, and
                        that none would be shown during the year now coming to a close, I have
                        ventured to send to the consuls another dispatch asking for information.</p>
                    <p>Trusting that my action in the various phases of this most important question
                        may meet with the approval of the Department,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Imperial Highness</hi>: Several reports have
                            been made to this legation by Mr. Consul-General Denny, at Shanghai, Mr.
                            Consul Seymour, at Canton, and certain American merchants doing business
                            at these ports, in reference to the action of his excellency Viceroy
                            Tseng, predecessor of his excellency Viceroy Chang, the present
                            incumbent at Canton.</p>
                        <p>From these reports the following facts appear:</p>
                        <p>The United States merchants have been sending to China shipments of
                            petroleum, which, as your imperial highness knows, is not only one of
                            the largest and most valuable of our mineral resources, but a valuable
                            part of our commerce with China.</p>
                        <p>As a fact, I may say that we supply petroleum to all the world. A recent
                            discovery, in general use for less than a quarter of a century, it has
                            been found one of the most beneficent agencies in nature, as a burning
                            oil, a medicine, a fuel, and in other forms.</p>
                        <p>The apparently inexhaustible quantity found in the petroleum regions has
                            made the production so cheap as to bring the cost within the reach of
                            the poorest classes.</p>
                        <p>This is shown in the consumption of the oil in other Asiatic countries,
                            especially in Java, India, and Japan, where its introduction has done
                            great good to the poor.</p>
                        <p>Under the treaties the duty upon petroleum is 5 per cent, ad valorem, and
                            American merchants are entitled to import it, paying this rate and no
                            more.</p>
                        <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0151"/>
                        <p>This tariff has prevailed and now prevails at all the ports of China open
                            to foreign trade, with the exception of Canton.</p>
                        <p>The former viceroy, some months ago, directed the imposition of a local
                            tax upon all petroleum received in Canton of 40 cents a case. This tax
                            is in addition and four times as large as that authorized by the
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>It was imposed, also, without giving the merchants any notice, so as to
                            guard them in ordering shipments from home. It has thus entailed severe
                            loss, amounting in the case of one firm to several thousand taels.</p>
                        <p>It furthermore seems that this tax has grown out of the fact that the
                            recent viceroy granted to certain merchants in Canton the monopoly of
                            selling kerosene for a yearly payment of $31,000. From this monopoly
                            they gain a revenue of $200,000, at the expense of the imperial
                            treasury, in diminishing the revenue that would accrue from petroleum in
                            the ordinary course of a great and increasing trade, and which can only
                            waste and die under this new burden, and also the comfort of your poorer
                            people, who, because of this burden and the withdrawal of trade sure to
                            follow it, will be unable to use petroleum.</p>
                        <p>The only expression of opinion I have been enabled to gather as to the
                            reasons for this act is found in a copy of a letter addressed by his
                            excellency Tseng to the British consul at Canton.</p>
                        <p>“The viceroy would observe,” says his excellency, “that once foreign
                            goods have entered China and become the property of Chinese merchants,
                            the method and amount of their taxation are matters wholly and solely
                            within the discretion of China.”</p>
                        <p>Your imperial highness will see at a glance that the question is far
                            different from that presented by the viceroy. In Article V of the treaty
                            signed in 1844 by my predecessor, Mr. Cushing, and his excelleney the
                            late Tsi Yeng, acting in the name of the throne, it is especially
                            provided:</p>
                        <p>“At each of the said five ports, citizens of the United States lawfully
                            engaged in commerce shall be permitted to import, from their own or any
                            other ports, into China, and sell there, and purchase therein and export
                            to their own or any other ports, all manner of merchandise of which the
                            importation or exportation is not prohibited by this treaty, paying the
                            duties which are prescribed by the tariff hereinbefore established, and
                            no other charges whatsoever.”</p>
                        <p>Under the provisions of this treaty American merchants may sell or
                            purchase any manner of merchandise not forbidden by treaty, paying the
                            duties prescribed, “and no other charges whatsoever.”</p>
                        <p>In Canton, therefore, we have an undeniable and flagrant violation of
                            this treaty. A tax has been imposed virtually adding 300 per cent, to
                            what the law requires.</p>

                            <item>It is, therefore, my duty to demand from your imperial highness
                                the abrogation of this decree of the viceroy, as an invasion of
                                treaty engagements.</item>
                            <label>II.</label>
                            <item>A return to the merchants who have suffered from this illegal act
                                of the sums so exacted, with proper interest upon the same, to the
                                end that no loss may fall upon them because of the action of the
                                viceroy and the Chinese who hold the Government monopoly.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>These are the only questions in which my Government has a direct
                            interest. But one or two observations may not be without value as to the
                            nature of the monopoly created in Canton. I have referred to the
                            beneficent nature of petroleum; that it is one of the blessings of
                            modern society, and that China has much to gain by its universal
                            dissemination. China is far behind other Asiatic nations in the
                            enjoyment of this valued product. The figures show that Java, with a
                            population of 19,000.000, imports annually 1,900,000 cases; Japan, with
                            26,000,000, 1,800,000; and India, with 240,000,000, 1,500,000.</p>
                        <p>The low proportion of the Indian demand may be partly accounted for by
                            the extreme poverty of large numbers of the Hindoos, who have difficulty
                            in obtaining the means of existence. China, a rich country, with
                            unbounded resources and a wider distribution among the people of the
                            means of life, and a population believed to be far larger than that of
                            the other three countries combined, takes only 900,000 cases of
                            petroleum, 1,000,000 less than Java, 900,000 less than Japan, 60,000
                            less than India.</p>
                        <p>If monopolies like those in Canton are created, your imperial highness
                            cannot fail to see that you are imposing a new tax upon your people. If
                            petroleum were an article which your own mineral resources could supply;
                            if there was anything in China which would do as much good at so low a
                            price if it could be manufactured; if there were any Chinese interest to
                            be served by it, this legation could look with forbearance upon any
                            attempt to nourish and protect your interests.</p>
                        <p>It is a product of nature. It competes with no Chinese interests or
                            industry. It is entirely for the advantage of your people, as it has
                            proved to be to all classes of people throughout the world. There is
                            every reason, therefore, why monopolies like the one in Canton should be
                            suppressed. The first is the injury to your own people in keeping from
                            them an agency that would add so much to their comfort and happiness.
                            The second is the injury it must do to your treasury. We have a large
                            trade, the revenue from which is an important factor in His Majesty’s
                            exchequer. Were petroleum <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0152"/>to be
                            consumed throughout China in the same proportion as in Java and Japan,
                            the trade would grow to a vast extent, to your enhanced gain. These
                            monopolies encouraged, this profit to China would disappear
                            altogether.</p>
                        <p>I volunteer these considerations to your imperial highness, not that they
                            have any special bearing upon the immediate question which inspires this
                            dispatch, but I am persuaded they will strengthen your imperial highness
                            in your natural inclination to take an enlightened view of a most
                            important subject. My duty is to point out to the cabinet the very grave
                            wrong that has been done to our interests in Canton by the undeniable
                            violation of treaty, and to repeat my demand that the additional tax be
                            withdrawn from petroleum in American ships, and that what has been
                            unlawfully exacted shall be repaid without delay, and with interest, at
                            the rate now current in the money markets of China, from the time it was
                            imposed.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my dispatch No. 277, November, 1883, I had
                        the honor to inclose for your information the details in the possession of
                        the legation regarding the riot in Canton.</p>
                    <p>It is now my duty to report upon subsequent events, and especially upon the
                        efforts of the representatives of foreign powers in Peking to bring about a
                        settlement.</p>
                    <p>As soon as I learned of the Canton riots I had a conversation with the grand
                        secretary, Li, who said there would be no difficulty in the payment of the
                        American claims for the losses sustained by our citizens, and that orders
                        for their payment would be given. This assurance was confirmed by the
                        ministers of the yamên.</p>
                    <p>There were diverging theories in the minds of the various legations as to the
                        cause of the riot, and whether or not the cause could be found in the
                        failure of the Canton viceroy to do his duty in preventing and suppressing
                        it.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>The first suggestion as to a means of settlement came from his imperial
                        highness Prince Kung, in an informal note to this legation dated October 13,
                        1883. In this his imperial highness said that Mr. Consul Seymour was willing
                        to render his good offices towards mediation; that his imperial highness was
                        pleased with this offer, and asked me to instruct Mr. Seymour to do what he
                        could to secure a just and equitable arrangement.</p>
                    <p>While it was a gratification to the legation to know that Mr. Seymour was
                        held in esteem by the Chinese, there were practical difficulties, arising
                        out of diplomatic relations here, which prevented my encouraging his
                        plan.</p>
                    <p>At the same time it seemed to the legation that this abstract proposal of
                        mediation on the part of the Chinese contained within it the germ of a most
                        important principle, and that if we could establish it as a precedent it
                        would go far towards making easy the settlement of difficulties of the same
                        character.</p>
                    <p>This view was shared by my colleagues of England, France, and Germany. As
                        their representative and in their name I entered into negotiations <pb
                            n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0153"/>with the yamên. After some
                        conversations and explanations with the ministers, and a verbal
                        understanding that we were in accord, his imperial highness addressed to
                        the. powers concerned an informal note, dated November 11, 1883, which I
                        inclose.</p>
                    <p>In this note you will see that the yamiên, instead of asking Mr. Seymour to
                        act, proposed a board of arbitrators, to be composed of three persons who
                        should be acceptable to all parties.</p>
                    <p>This proposal was accepted by my colleagues and myself in a joint note dated
                        November 21, 1883. There was one amendment, namely, that the members of the
                        board should be of equal rank, without one having the special supervising
                        power of a referee, and that the decision of a majority should be accepted
                        as final.</p>
                    <p>There was a verbal understanding that all losses should be paid within sixty
                        days after the award. We also agreed, at my nomination that the Hon. Mr.
                        Grosvenor, Her Britannic Majesty’s chargé d’affaires, should represent the
                        foreign powers.</p>
                    <p>This note was not written until after many conferences with the yamên, and a
                        clear understanding that the jurisdiction of the proposed board should be
                        confined to the assessment of the money claims for damages, and that other
                        questions, political or otherwise, should be debarred. It was therefore with
                        surprise, and not without some pain, that I received from his imperial
                        highness a note, dated November 23, in which a new principle was inserted.
                        The riots, according to the prince, having originated in murder, “an
                        investigation into the causes of the riot should be the objective point.”
                        Then should come the punishment of the guilty parties “according to their
                        deserts, and there would be no difficulty in bringing out the truth in
                        regard to damages to property.”</p>
                    <p>This note was a surprise. It struck at the very root of the arbitration, and
                        was a departure from all our agreements with the yamên.</p>
                    <p>The question advanced by the prince concerned England alone. It was a
                        question also involving principles and rights which neither England nor any
                        other self-respecting power could submit to a court of arbitration. Whatever
                        might be thought of the manslaughter by Logan, and what was regarded as the
                        lightness of his sentence and the imperfections of his trial, he had been
                        tried by an English judge, before an English jury, according to English law,
                        and there was no power, not even the power of the Queen, which could put him
                        in peril of his life a second time. This I had said again and again to the
                        ministers in conversation, adding that the same law prevailed in the United
                        States and in other civilized nations, and that it was vain to intrude it
                        upon an arbitration which meant to decide one point, namely, what foreigners
                        lost at the hands of a Chinese mob. But there was a war party in the
                        cabinet; the feeling at Canton was uneasy; the viceroy at Canton was
                        telegraphing his fears; and while the ministers of the yamên might be
                        willing to continue the negotiations on the basis agreed upon and detailed
                        in our joint note, the privy council, to whom the ministers appeal, insisted
                        upon the modification.</p>
                    <p>It only remained for the representatives of the four powers to meet in
                        conference and, after reading the prince’s note, reject the terms proposed.
                        This was a unanimous decision, expressed in a joint note to the yamên dated
                        November 25.</p>
                    <p>I was loath to abandon the advantages embodied in the principle of the
                        arbitration, and this feeling was shared by my colleagues. I did not set
                        much value upon any other point so far as American interests were concerned.
                        I was indifferent as to whether we had a representative on the proposed
                        board, and never encouraged the idea. As the subjects <pb n="54"
                            xml:id="pg_54" facs="0154"/>of Great Britain in Canton had sustained the
                        greatest losses, it seemed only fair that an Englishman should represent the
                        foreigners, especially one with the rectitude and impartiality of Mr.
                        Grosvenor. As the Germans had the second largest claim in losses, I would
                        vote for any gentleman named by Germany. While I would accept an American as
                        a judge, and take such a nomination either by the Chinese or the foreign
                        powers, I had no name to present. My only anxiety was for the principle. The
                        assurance of the Chinese authorities left me no reason for anxiety as to all
                        American claims being paid; and as to the value of these claims, the verdict
                        of any court where a German and an Englishman were in the majority would
                        satisfy me. As a principle of diplomatic intercourse, the acceptance by the
                        Chinese of an arbitration in manner and form as proposed I deemed an
                        important advantage.</p>
                    <p>In my conference with the yamên the ministers presented their ease at length
                        and with some feeling. They held that, as a British subject, Logan had led
                        to the riot by an assault upon an innocent Chinaman, taking his life; that
                        the British Government was responsible for the consequences of the riot, and
                        should even pay the damages claimed by foreigners. They contended that
                        Logan’s trial was so unsatisfactory that nothing would satisfy Chinese
                        public sentiment in Canton but a new trial and capital punishment of the
                        offender. They claimed also that the British Government should pay an
                        indemnity for the Chinese slain and wounded by Logan, even as China had paid
                        an indemnity to Great Britain when Margary was slain, and also to France
                        after the riots in Tien-Tsin and Shanghai. The ministers furthermore said
                        that while Mr. Grosvenor was known and personally held in high esteem by the
                        yamên, and his proposed nomination as one of the board would be agreeable,
                        the viceroy, the authorities, and the people of Canton were so much opposed
                        to any Englishman having a place in that tribunal that they must insist upon
                        the withdrawal of his name.</p>
                    <p>I replied that all questions as to “British justice,” “indemnities,”
                        “responsibilities,” and so on, were matters which concerned alone the
                        British crown. As to the nomination of Mr. Grosvenor as our representative,
                        we could not withdraw it. The powers had a right to name whom they pleased.
                        They could not allow that right to be criticised. This would be to destroy
                        the integrity of arbitration. Mr. Grosvenor had been named unanimously,
                        without his knowledge or request, and to withdraw his name would be a
                        discourtesy to which none of his colleagues would be a party. I was then
                        asked why our legation would not take Mr. Holcombe or Mr. Seymour in Mr.
                        Grosvenor’s place as the foreign representative. I answered that the
                        proposal of the name of any American official was a compliment, but I would
                        not consent to it. We had named Mr. Grosvenor, and his name must stand.</p>
                    <p>The ministers said they would confer with the prince and the privy council
                        and see what could be done. They were evidently as anxious as myself to come
                        to some arrangement, and our conference ended with the expression of a
                        common regret that there seemed to be no ground upon which we could
                        agree.</p>
                    <p>The next day I had a note from the yamên that they would come and see me, and
                        at 2 o’clock we had a long conference at the legation.</p>
                    <p>The ministers were Ch’en, Chow, and Woo. We began with the quaint oriental
                        metaphor that they were “ill with the evil of contention and war and bad
                        feeling, and had come for medicine.” The privy council had been much in
                        debate and wanted a compromise. They went over the whole ground of the
                        controversy, and said they had weighed with care the arguments of our
                        legation. They now had a <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0155"/>new
                        proposal. They would no longer object to Mr. Grosvenor. All questions at
                        issue with Great Britain they would reserve, with one exception, namely, the
                        amount of indemnity to be paid to the family of the Chinaman slain by Logan.
                        That the prince must insist upon submitting to the proposed board. The
                        prince said China paid indemnities for murdered foreigners, and now
                        foreigners should pay indemnities for murdered Chinamen. If we would accept
                        a note couched in these terms, they were prepared to name Kung Yi T’u, a
                        high official, as their agent; and as Mr. Grosvenor was a secretary of
                        legation, and should have a colleague of his own rank, they would be
                        willing, if the powers consented, to withdraw Mr. Seymour’s name and accept
                        that of Mr. Holcombe. This agreed upon, or any other third man we preferred
                        in Mr. Holcombe’s place, they would at once enter upon the question and pay
                        all awards within sixty days. They again and again expressed their anxiety
                        to have the matter at an end. They gave me plainly to understand that in
                        this they were acting under the orders of the privy council.</p>
                    <p>While the withdrawal of every point with the exception of an indemnity to the
                        family of the slain Chinaman seemed to be an important step in the
                        negotiation, I still pressed the ministers to return to their original
                        ground, and, as we had agreed, consider no question but the losses. Although
                        I could not speak for Her Britannic Majesty’s Government, I felt sure that
                        there would be a way to reach the “indemnity” question without bringing it
                        before the board. A small, a very small sum would have been all that the
                        family of the class of the murdered Chinamen could expect. A present, say,
                        of £500 would have been to the family a princely fortune. I did not express
                        any thought of this kind to the ministers. But I was persuaded that in the
                        event of a successful arbitration, the Chinese paying the losses within
                        sixty days after the announcement of the award, the British legation would
                        readily have seen its way, as an act of benevolence, laying aside any
                        question of policy, to recompense the family of the slain Chinaman. It was
                        the certainty in my own mind, looking over the whole affair from what might
                        be called a common-sense business point of view, that the British minister
                        would reach such a conclusion when he came to consider the whole question,
                        that led me to press upon the ministers the propriety of abandoning the
                        indemnity point, and all points that had not been agreed upon before we
                        wrote our joint note.</p>
                    <p>In this case you will see that the yamên ministers were fortified by the
                        opinion of one Mr. Francis, who is, I am told, an English barrister, holding
                        the retainer of the Chinese authorities and supposed to know English law.
                        Upon the point, therefore, that there should be no arbitration which did not
                        recognize the indemnity claim, the Chinese were inflexible.</p>
                    <p>Sir Harry Parkes returned from Corea on the 9th; I saw him the day following.
                        His excellency would never consent to the demand of the yamên ministers that
                        any question of indemnity should go before the board. He was willing to
                        accept the board, as had been arranged in our joint note. I was gratified to
                        hear from Her Majesty’s minister the volunteer expression of his hope and
                        belief that Her Britannic Majesty’s Government would be glad, as an act of
                        benevolence, to make some reparation to the families of the slain, in this
                        confirming the impression which had governed my counsels to the yamên. There
                        was no way in which I could convey this intimation to the yamên without an
                        intrusion upon an affair which alone concerned my colleague.</p>
                    <p>In my opinion, the decision of the British minister as to in admissibility
                            <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0156"/>of the indemnity question, which
                        I anticipated, and the immovable position of the yamên in insisting upon it,
                        closed the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>The subsequent action taken independently by the legation to secure the
                        payment of our claims will appear in the inclosures to this dispatch as an
                        appendix to the report.</p>

                            acknowledge the note of their excellencies dated November 11, 1883.</p>
                        <p>In this note your excellencies propose, in reference to the pillage of
                            Shameen and the outrages upon foreigners by a Cantonese mob, to nominate
                            a gentleman to deal with it on behalf of China. You then ask the
                            representatives of the powers interested “to consult together and name a
                            gentleman to arrange matters with your nominee. The two persons thus
                            appointed should choose a third person as referee, in order to avoid

                        <p>The undersigned have read and carefully considered this communication,
                            and Mr. Young, acting in their name, having had a conversation with your
                            excellencies as to the exact meaning and scope of your proposition, have

                            misapprehensions, will present the <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0157"
                            />case as they understand it. It is agreed hat these gentlemen shall
                            form a board of arbitration, that they shall be judges of equal rank and
                            authority, that in all questions a majority of the board shall decide,
                            and at the close of the discussion an award of the amounts due to each
                            claimant shall be paid by the Government against whom it is given,
                            without delay and without appeal by any of the arbitrators to any higher
                            authority whatever.</p>
                        <p>It is understood likewise that the decision of this board as to the money
                            losses in Canton is to be final, and the undersigned, in the name of
                            their Governments, upon the payment of the awards made within a
                            reasonable time, not less than thirty days after the award, will regard
                            the case as absolutely closed, and hold the Chinese Government free from
                            any further recourse as to claims arising out of the Shameen riot.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned would also suggest that, as the season is late, and it is
                            important to have this business ended, after the yamên, on the one part,
                            and the undersigned, on the other, have named their representatives,
                            that the yamên and the undersigned should in conference name a third
                            gentleman who would be entirely acceptable to both sides. A selection
                            made in this manner would come within the principles of a just and
                            equitable arbitration.</p>
                        <p>If this statement of the case shows that we have rightly construed the
                            meaning of your dispatch, the undersigned, upon the receipt of that
                            information, of such assurances as are requisite to make the arbitration
                            a valid tribunal, and of the name of the gentleman you propose as your
                            representative, are prepared to name their representative and do all in
                            their power to bring the business to a satisfactory termination.</p>
                        <p>Accept, &amp;c.</p>

                            the honor to receive your collective note, in which it was stated that
                            you accept certain propositions made by this office in an earlier note
                            in regard to disposing of the Shameen case, and that yon recognize a
                            desire to do all in my power to atone for the injury inflicted upon
                            foreigners by a Chinese mob; that an arbitration is meant in which a
                            majority shall decide all questions, and that an early disposition of
                            the case is much to be desired, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>In the Shameen affair the prince and ministers would observe that, it
                            having originated in murder, an investigation into the circumstances of
                            the riot should be the objective point. These circumstances being
                            correct, the guilty parties could be punished according to their
                            deserts, and there would be no difficulty in bringing out the truth in
                            regard to any damages to property.</p>
                        <p>This was the purpose of the prince and ministers in their proposition in
                            an earlier note to appoint aboard of arbitration; and I beg your
                            excellencies to take it into consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: Upon the 17th instant you came
                            to this office with Mr. Secretary Holcombe and in person presented a
                            memorandum in three points upon the mode of dealing with the Shameen
                            affair. This memorandum I have attentively considered.</p>
                        <p>It inquires whether my original proposition meant an arbitration of the
                            losses sustained in the riot or an inquiry into the circumstances of the
                            disturbance.</p>
                        <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0158"/>
                        <p>In my opinion, an examination into the circumstances which gave rise to
                            the riot ought certainly to be made the leading point of any inquiry.
                            These circumstances being correctly understood, the responsible parties
                            ought to be punished as they deserve, and if there are claims for
                            damages there would be no difficulty in bringing the fact to light. I am
                            confident your excellency will agree with me in this view.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the dispatch received from the several representatives, as
                            it does not agree with my original idea, a separate response has been
                            made to it. I am aware that your excellency transacts all business in an
                            amicable spirit, and that you will be able to evolve a satisfactory
                            scheme out of these two plans.</p>

                        <p>The undersigned have received and read the communication which your
                            imperial highness was good enough to make to them on the 23d
                            instant.</p>
                        <p>They have to observe in reply that the circumstances which may have led
                            to the burning and pillage of Shameen do not in any way concern them in
                            their corporate capacity. They therefore find themselves under the
                            necessity of declining any participation in the appointment of a
                            commission the object of which would be to arbitrate upon the events
                            which led to the burning and pillage in question. The only subject with
                            which the undersigned have any concern in their corporate capacity is
                            the amount of money to be awarded to the various foreigners who have
                            suffered in property through the lawless action of the Canton mob.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned can only regret that the Chinese Government should have
                            introduced into an arrangement which at the outset promised such
                            satisfactory results to all parties matters on the discussion of which
                            they cannot consent to enter.</p>
                        <p>The claims which the Governments of the United States, Germany, Great
                            Britain, and France have to make upon the Chinese Government for the
                            losses sustained by their respective citizens and subjects will now be
                            brought forward by each representative at the proper time.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose for your
                        information certain correspondence between the legation and our consul at
                        Canton, which I am sure you will read with pain.</p>
                    <p>The continuance of a spirit of unrest and mutiny in Canton, so far as
                        foreigners are concerned, is a grave circumstance.</p>
                    <p>You will note that an incendiary proclamation, purporting to come from the
                        imperial commissioner Pang, breathing antipathy and bitterness towards
                        foreigners, was allowed to circulate throughout Canton for two days. The
                        viceroy afterwards disavowed it, and I am informed has issued proclamations
                        of an assuring character. Copies of these have these have not reached the
                        legation.</p>
                    <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0159"/>
                    <p>I made an earnest representation to the yamên on the subject of this
                        proclamation, and said to the ministers that if, as a consequence of its
                        indiscreet and inflammatory terms, neither withdrawn nor disavowed by the
                        viceroy for two days, there had been another riot like that in the Shameen,
                        the legation would have a strong argument for contending that the riot was
                        an official and not a popular outbreak, and that China should pay not only
                        direct but consequential damages. This view I expressed in a dispatch to Mr.
                        Seymour, inclosure No. 3, requesting him to give it to the viceroy as the
                        opinion of the legation.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>This difficulty, however, attends all political events in China at the
                        present time, and adds immeasurably to the embarrassments of the situation,
                        not alone so far as the foreigners, but even the Chinese authorities, like
                        the viceroy of Canton, who wish to do justly towards foreigners, are
                        concerned.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that Canton
                            has, during this week, been thoroughly stirred up by the arrival of
                            Imperial Commissioner Pang and about four thousand Chinese soldiers from
                            the north, and the large sale and circulation of printed matter,
                            purporting to be a proclamation from that official, enjoining upon
                            foreigners to remove their merchandise and property out of the port of
                            Canton, to avert the calamities of war, which seems to be imminent by
                            the aggressive action of France against Annam, over which China claims
                            sovereignty. It has been a week of unusual anxiety among native and
                            foreign merchants and missionaries of all nations or nationalities and
                            denominations, and of general excitement among the Chinese masses, who
                            were led to believe that foreigners must go, and that their merchandise
                            and property were to be legitimate objects of pillage and destruction,
                            and that the imperial commissioner would immediately reverse the policy
                            and action of the viceroy, whom they denounced for his protection of
                            foreigners.</p>
                        <p>The imperial commissioner arrived in Canton Monday morning, 3d instant,
                            at which time the steamer Whai Yuen landed on Shameen, <hi rend="italic"
                                >en route</hi> to the city, a thousand soldiers. Instantly the word
                            new from one to another throughout Canton that the imperial
                            commissioner, Pang, had arrived and marched his soldiers through Shameen
                            to let the foreigners understand they must go and that this reservation
                            for foreigners is at an end.</p>
                        <p>Interviews with the commissioner, Pang, by anti-foreign Chinese of
                            distinction and influence were publicly alleged to have elicited from
                            him decided disapproval of the course of the viceroy.</p>
                        <p>On the evening of Monday, or early on the morning of Tuesday, 4th
                            instant, the streets of Canton were echoing the shouts of venders of
                            hand-bills purporting to be a proclamation from the commissioner, in
                            Mandarin and English (as per copy inclosed), the said venders causing
                            the populace to believe the commissioner had decreed, in the name of the
                            Emperor, that foreigners must go, and that their merchandise and
                            property would be subject to pillage and destruction, <hi rend="italic"
                                >at the expense of France instead of China.</hi></p>
                        <p>The uninterrupted sale and circulation of those mischievous documents on
                            the public streets from Tuesday morning until Thursday noon deepened the
                            impression that their publication and circulation were authorized,</p>
                        <p>The Chinese merchants doing business with foreigners were the first to
                            show solicitude for the safety of merchandise or property purchased and
                            ordered for exportation.</p>
                        <p>The foreign merchants quickly caught alarm for the safety of their
                            merchandise and property and their established business between China
                            and other countries.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Christians soon had intimations that after foreigners left
                            Canton vengeance would fall heavily upon the converts.</p>
                        <p>They rushed to the missionaries for counsel and protection, and thus the
                            entire population became intensely interested in the results. The
                            consulates were quickly <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0160"/>sought by
                            many who were deeply concerned about the situation of affairs, and it
                            became necessary to take prompt action to avert serious outrages against
                            native Christians and their chapels, and also the chapels and schools of
                            the various missions, all of which were in jeopardy to such an extent
                            that their doors were kept closed, buildings guarded, and vigilance
                            maintained to prevent pillage and destruction.</p>
                        <p>On Tuesday a mob gathered at the new “Chinese Doctrine Propagating Hall,”
                            which was built, at an expense of 900 taels, by native converts to
                            Christianity who are in connection with the American Baptist
                            mission.</p>
                        <p>The hall is located near the river, about midway between Dr. Kerr’s
                            hospital and the Berlin mission house, or between the American
                            Presbyterian and American Baptist mission chapels, in that part of
                            Canton where turbulent elements are abundant.</p>
                        <p>The mob, under the pretext of provocation on account of the opposition of
                            the preachers at the hall to “ancestral tablets” worship, smashed the
                            windows and doors and other portions of the hall, and on Wednesday, the
                            5th instant, again returned to the hall and demolished the pulpit, pews,
                            and plastering. Soldiers were sent by the authorities to the rescue, and
                            further injury to the hall was prevented.</p>
                        <p>On Thursday two chapels and a school-house, in three different parts of
                            the city, and under the auspices of the American Presbyterian mission,
                            in charge of the venerable Rev. Dr. Happer, were threatened with
                            destruction; and if the doors had been opened, those three buildings
                            would doubtless have been immediately destroyed.</p>
                        <p>The owner of one of the buildings, in terror of the mob, hurried to Dr.
                            Happer and demanded surrender of the lease to save his building from
                            destruction, after a continuous lease of twenty years.</p>
                        <p>My dispatch of Thursday, 6th instant, to the viceroy, in regard to the
                            American Presbyterian chapels and schools, and dispatch of Friday, 7th
                            instant, asking proclamations for security of the natives’ hall,
                            received satisfactory attention.</p>
                        <p>On Thursday afternoon, 6th, the influence of the authorities was felt
                            throughout the city in efforts to counteract the effects of the alleged
                            proclamation and to restore order and tranquillity, and by Friday
                            evening, 7th instant, matters became comfortably quiet, and to-day,
                            Saturday, 8th, the anti-foreign rage has completely subsided. Strong
                            proclamations have been issued, and are respected, in favor of
                            tranquillity.</p>
                        <p>This sudden and welcome subsidence of one of the most formidable
                            outbursts of anti-foreign rage witnessed in Canton during the past
                            seventeen years, based, as was alleged and believed, on the
                            encouragement and leadership of an inferior official invested with high
                            prerogatives and sustained by imperial decree, is one of the marvels of
                            government in a city of over two millions of people without a press. It
                            was generally believed, and is now and yet thought by many well-informed
                            residents who have access to many sources of information, that a
                            proclamation of the nature of the document referred to was actually in
                            preparation or had been prepared, and was either delayed through the
                            reluctance of the viceroy to have it issued or slowness in carving
                            plates for its publication in large letters.</p>
                        <p>The missionaries, their families and friends, met, to the number of fifty
                            or more, in conference at the house of Rev. Dr. Thompson, one-quarter of
                            a mile east of the hospital, on the evening of Wednesday, 5th instant,
                            and manifested profound solicitude for the safety of their respective
                            missions, and especially for those of the native converts.</p>
                        <p>An influential committee was appointed to confer with consuls.</p>
                        <p>Realizing the necessity of prompt action, I prepared and had translated
                            into Chinese a dispatch to the viceroy (as per copy herewith) upon the
                            situation of affairs, on Wednesday evening, for delivery before 9
                            o’clock Thursday morning at the yamên, thus anticipating the action of
                            that conference.</p>
                        <p>The consular corps, including consular officers of Great Britain,
                            Germany, France, United States, Netherlands, Sweden and Norway, and
                            Denmark, assembled, by request of citizens concerned, at the consular
                            headquarters, in the United States consulate, for consultation, at 5
                            o’clock p.m., Thursday, 6th instant, when it was agreed that an
                            identical letter should be sent from all of the consulates to the
                            viceroy, after approval of a form to be submitted at an adjourned
                            meeting on Friday noon, 7th instant, at which last meeting the viceroy’s
                            replies and measures, elicited by the United States consul’s dispatch
                            (promising military protection to the threatened chapels and repudiating
                            the unauthorized proclamations, so called), gave all reasonable
                            assurance that order and tranquillity would be restored, and were deemed
                            so satisfactory as to render it unnecessary to make any further
                            communication, although the French consul, probably at the suggestion of
                            the Roman Catholic bishop, who was deeply concerned, had called the
                            viceroy’s attention to the dangers surrounding French residents by the
                            publicity of such tirades against France in Canton.</p>
                        <p>All residents, and especially the missionaries, feel that the timely
                            arrest of the excitement, in response to the United States consul’s
                            dispatch of the 5th instant, delivered <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61"
                                facs="0161"/>to the viceroy early on the morning of the 6th instant,
                            averted serious outrages, against native and foreign Christians, and
                            perhaps prevented other deplorable acts, of a mob. It was one of those
                            cases where or in which remonstrance took effect in time to prevent
                            great harm.</p>
                        <p>I take pleasure in making record of the facts, as it affords renewed
                            proof of the purpose of the viceroy to maintain in good faith and full
                            force the stipulations of treaty or treaties for the security of
                            foreigners and their interests, and also to prevent the-persecution of
                            natives, as well as foreigners, of the Christian faith.</p>
                        <p>Hoping that Canton may long be spared from another and similar visitation
                            of rage and excitement against foreigners and Christians,</p>
                        <p>I am, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p rend="center">A.</p>
                        <p>I, Pang, imperial commissioner, do hereby publicly notify that as France
                            is seeking or causing trouble which may result in war, it is necessary
                            that we should make due preparations against any calamity or
                            calamities.</p>
                        <p>That as foreign nations have had trade with China for years, and as our
                            great Emperor always considers that foreigners who came from a long
                            distance and Chinese a&amp; one family, whereby every one may be
                            benefited by interests in trade, and as there is no false idea or
                            pretension among them, they would wholly enjoy peace and observe
                            treaties.</p>
                        <p>That, as all foreign nations must have seen and known, China does not
                            wish, on account of trivial or trifling matters, to make war.</p>
                        <p>But as the French entertain ill feeling, and know that Annam has for
                            generations past paid tribute to China, yet they, depending upon their
                            strength to insult a weak, nation, and that in violation of treaty, they
                            have inaugurated war by use of soldiers against Annam.</p>
                        <p>China has for a long time wished to comply with applications and send
                            assistance to Annam; but fearing friendly relations might thereby be
                            disturbed, has therefore refrained from sending such assistance.</p>
                        <p>In former months the French minister, Tricou, arrived at Tien-Tsin in a
                            French man-of-war, stating that a large fleet of French war ships will
                            come to Canton and cause injuries.</p>
                        <p>This, however, is a mere ruse upon the part of the French to frighten,
                            and their cunning tricks cannot be ascertained.</p>
                        <p>My great Emperor became wrath at this, and sent me to Canton to assume
                            military command here; now I have brought together both land and sea
                            forces, and to see what measures can be taken.</p>
                        <p>If they come with troops we will at once fight with France.</p>
                        <p>The outbreak rests upon France, which took the first step, and therefore
                            we are-obliged to make efforts for our defense.</p>
                        <p>I hope other nations will know or determine which is in the right and
                            which is in the wrong.</p>
                        <p>Considering or whereas that if fighting begins on the seas, merchant
                            ships would, not come, and therefore commerce with foreign nations will
                            be interrupted.</p>
                        <p>As Chinese troops cannot recognize, distinguish, or discriminate between
                            the flags of foreign nations, that in event of a future war the merchant
                            vessels of other nations, happening to pass in the vicinity of strife
                            might be mistaken by Chinese soldiers and people for those of the enemy,
                            and thereby complications may occur.</p>
                        <p>Considering that all foreign merchants have with great difficulty crossed

                            various branches of trade by Chinese and foreigners is different, yet

                        <p>Besides having asked the Emperor to instruct the tsung-li yamên to inform
                            the ministers of foreign nations, I now issue this notice for the
                            general information of foreign merchants, that they should beforehand
                            remove out of port (or harbor) merchandise or property, thus to escape
                            the danger of war, if France is inclined to be the aggressor and send
                            troops to give battle.</p>
                        <p>During the contest between China and France all vessels of other nations
                            must conform to international law.</p>
                        <p>A ship or cargo taken as a prize, the nation in question cannot accuse us
                            of wrong.</p>
                        <p>In all places where the French take hostile action for any merchandise
                            belonging to foreign merchants destroyed by fire or pillaged, the nation
                            will have to demand indemnity from France, and cannot demand it from
                            China.</p>
                        <p>By reason of one nation violating the treaty the commerce of other
                            nations will be involved, and thus the fault rests upon the one causing
                            the trouble; and all nations will discriminate justly in the matter.</p>
                        <p>I sincerely publish this proclamation with the hope of notifying the
                            merchants of all nationalities, that they may understand and take
                            precautions, and thus prevent being entangled in difficulties.</p>

                        <p>The chapel is located on the north side of and near the river, between

                            to be regarded by the turbulent element as an encouragement to destroy
                            the merchandise of foreigners whenever it is thought France shall have
                            assumed a warlike attitude toward China, the danger being that many

                        <p>Chang, viceroy of the two Kwangs, sends the following communication in
                            reply to the consul:</p>
                        <p>Upon the 7th day of the 11th moon of the 9th year of Kwang Hsui (December
                            6, 1883) the viceroy received a dispatch from the consul. [Here the
                            contents of the dispatch are quoted in full.]</p>
                        <p>The viceroy would state that yesterday he had heard of the disturbance
                            made by some lawless people toward a chapel which is situated at
                            Ng-Shin-Moon, near the river, and as was stated in the dispatch under
                            acknowledgment.</p>
                        <p>The viceroy has consequently directed the local authorities (both civil
                            and military) to take soldiers and proceed with them to that vicinity
                            and maintain order there.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently those officials informed the viceroy that they had
                            maintained order and dispersed the crowd, and that everything is quiet
                            and restored to peace. However, <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0163"
                            />the viceroy gave strict instructions to these officials that they
                            should at all times inquire and give protection in case of need, thereby
                            to maintain peace among natives and foreigners.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the proclamation which you said had been sold about in the
                            streets for two days, and which has produced much uneasiness and general
                            excitement, the viceroy would state that all proclamations which are
                            issued by the officials in China should bear the official seal upon them
                            before they are published, and that upon examining the inclosed
                            proclamation the viceroy found it was printed by the people and secretly
                            sold amongst them; thus it will be understood that it affords
                            insufficient proof to be considered genuine.</p>
                        <p>Upon receipt of the foregoing dispatch the viceroy at once instructed the
                            Namhai and Poon Iu magistrates and the prefect of Ouang Chow that they
                            should at all times inquire into, arrest, and strictly prohibit the
                            publishing of any such false notice.</p>
                        <p>It is deemed proper that the viceroy should send this in reply to the
                            consul, for his information.</p>
                        <p>Kwang Hsui, 9th year, 11th moon, 7th day (December 6, 1888).</p>

                        <p>A subsequent dispatch from the viceroy assured protection to the American
                            Presbyterian chapel and school, and another “and later dispatch from the
                            viceroy reports directions to the magistrates to issue proclamations to
                            protect the native Christians and their hall.</p>
                        <p>Proclamations have been made as desired, not only by magistrates but by
                            the imperial commissioner.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have read with painful interest your
                            dispatch No.44, December 8, 1883. The condition of affairs therein
                            narrated shows a disposition towards foreigners much to be regretted,
                            coming especially after the serious outbreak in the Shameen.</p>
                        <p>Your prompt action in presenting the case to the viceroy meets with the
                            commendation of the legation.</p>
                        <p>This remonstrance, I think, might have taken a more serious form. The
                            proclamation of Pang was an unwise and unfriendly document, one
                            calculated to inspire the worst feelings in a community where the spirit
                            of intolerance already prevailed. It came from a high official, who
                            spoke in the name of His Majesty. Although disavowed and withdrawn, it
                            was sold about the streets for two days. The viceroy says that it bore
                            on its face the evidence that it was not genuine. And yet I have seen
                            nothing to show that the imperial commissioner Pang did not write or
                            inspire it. The real meaning of the viceroy’s comment, as found in your
                            inclosure C, is not that the proclamation was fraudulent, but simply
                            irregular, informal, not official.</p>
                        <p>For the viceroy to permit an incendiary proclamation of this nature to
                            circulate for two days was to assume a grave responsibility, and if any
                            outrage had taken place, as at the Shameen, it would have been difficult
                            to have released the Chinese from the responsibility of not alone actual
                            but of exemplary damages.</p>
                        <p>You will, in your conversations with the viceroy, impress this fact upon
                            the attention of his excellency. The legations here know that Canton is
                            the seat of peculiar irritations and disturbances, that political
                            feeling runs high, and that rulers with the firmest nerves may tremble
                            in the presence of the elements of discontent and misrule which there
                            prevail. But unless his excellency proposes to surrender his high
                            authority to a mob, there is no time in which to end a demonstration of
                            this kind except <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0164"/>at the outset.
                            The fact that his excellency should have allowed it to run for two days
                            without check or rebuke is a painful incident.</p>
                        <p>Your action in taking the matter in hand at once, meets with my
                            commendation. My chief regret is, and out of this regret arises a
                            constant anxiety as to Canton, that the viceroy failed to see at the
                            outset what justice to the foreigner, and even loyalty to the throne,
                            required of him.</p>

                        <p>Li Hung Chang has addressed a memorial to the throne, in which he refers
                            to the great distresses among the poor arising out of the floods in the
                            northern provinces of China, and especially in the country surrounding
                            Tien-Tsin and Peking.</p>
                        <p>With the arrival of winter the floods have left the higher-lying ground,
                            but all the low-lying lands continue to present the aspect of an
                            unbroken sea, which must shortly be frozen over, adding the misery of
                            cold to the sufferings of people already borne down with hunger, and
                            precluding the possibility of hoping to be able to sow the crops in
                            spring. The funds available for the relief of this distress are already
                            more titan exhausted, and the drain upon the provincial revenue from
                            other sources is considerably more than it can bear. Under these
                            conditions it becomes necessary to look elsewhere for means, and the
                            only plan that suggests itself is to encourage private contribution by
                            the offer of honorary rewards. The abolition of the purchase system has
                            at present reduced the rewards that are allowed to be granted to mere
                            empty <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0165"/>rank or patents; which it
                            is found are not a sufficient inducement to encourage people to come
                            forward at all liberally, while the proposal to give buttons and
                            promotion as an extension of this system can only be availed of by the
                            wealthy classes. The board have made an exception to this rule in
                            Shantung, where full payment of contributions is allowed to be rewarded
                            by the bestowal of a <hi rend="italic">chien sheng</hi> degree, and the
                            memorialist would now beg that this privilege may be temporarily
                            extended to the province of Chihli, and withdrawn as soon as the
                            necessity which dictates the innovation shall cease.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">A long memorial from the governor-general, Li Hung
                            Chang, and the governor and governor adjoint of the Shun-t’ien
                            prefecture, detailing the measures they propose to take to relieve the
                            distress in their respective jurisdictions by the sale of grain at
                            reduced rates and other means.</p>
                        <p>Some time since the board of revenue communicated to the memorialists a
                            memorial submitted to His Majesty by a censor urging the necessity of
                            selling grain at reduced rates in Peking, with their minute thereon, in
                            which they expressed a fear that the capital would be invaded by large
                            numbers of poor in search of food unless timely measures were taken to
                            anticipate their arrival. They accordingly suggested that the province
                            of Chihli might be called upon to supply 100,000 taels, and that other
                            provinces, with the exception of Hupei, Shan Tung, and Chekiang, where
                            there was also much distress, might be directed each to contribute
                            30,000 taels from their opium lekin fund, or its equivalent in grain,
                            and send it to Chihli, where the memorialist Li Hung Chang would devote
                            the money to the purchase of grain, a portion of which would be sent to
                            Peking, to be sold there at reduced rates. The scheme having received
                            the sanction of His Majesty, it was communicated to the memorialists,
                            who have been in constant correspondence on the subject, and now beg to
                            submit an account of the arrangements they propose to make. They would
                            premise that in the year 1876, when a similar arrangement was called
                            for, the sum of 140,000 taels was devoted to the purchase of 87,000
                            piculs of grain, which was sent to Peking, and there sold at reduced
                            rates from the 1st to the 8th moon of the year. The losses on these
                            sales, inclusive of the cost of carriage, was 114,000 taels, which was
                            defrayed out of funds at the disposal of the board and the coast-defense
                            fund. The memorialist Li Hung Chang then proceeds to record, in somewhat
                            complicated and guarded language, his objections to the issue of relief
                            in the form of cheap grain: first, because it is impossible to determine
                            the genuineness of the poverty of the purchaser; secondly, because the
                            tendency of Pekingese to eat their grain in the form of flour renders it
                            necessary to have it ground by millers, who are certain to levy toll on
                            what passes through their hands; and, thirdly, because the present
                            stagnant condition of trade will prevent that substantial aid from
                            merchants being afforded which on former occasions was one of the chief
                            elements which conduced to the success of the undertaking. As, moreover,
                            the governor-general cannot be responsible for the managment of the
                            enterprise in the Shun-t’ien prefecture, he begs to retire from the
                            control as far as that region is concerned, and to leave it to the
                            governor and governor adjoint. As it is the chief object of the board of
                            revenue to provide against a pauper invasion of Peking, he opines that
                            this object will be met by applying the system it is proposed to
                            introduce to the Shun-t’ien prefecture alone, and he would suggest that
                            40,000 piculs of grain from the Peking granaries be placed at the
                            disposal of the governor and governor adjoint of Shun-t’ien, tor
                            disposal in the manner that further inquiry may show to be advisable. He
                            is prepared, if this suggestion meets with His Majesty’s approval, to
                            furnish 100,000 taels to be expended by the above officers in
                            relief.</p>

                        <p>The board suggested that the arsenal fund should contribute 40,000 taels
                            and the opium duties another 40,000 taels; but on reference to the
                            manager of the former establishment and the customs taotai, these
                            officers represent that they are not in a position to meet these claims
                            on their resources. The arsenal at Tien-Tsin is supported by a grant of
                            one-fourth of the foreign customs revenue, supplemented by a
                            contribution <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0166"/>paid from the duties
                            collected from the China Merchants’ Company. These grants have been
                            found insufficient of late years to meet the increased expenditure
                            entailed by the extra provision of ammunition required by the different
                            provinces and the purchase of foreign machinery which this larger output
                            requires—so much so that the accounts show a large deficit, which for
                            the last three years has been partially met by a monthly grant of 10,000
                            taels from the board of revenue. The duties on foreign opium and dues
                            collected from the China Merchants’ Company are amalgamated under one
                            head, and four-tenths of the total receipts are paid over to the
                            arsenal, with the exception of one-fifth of the China Merchants’
                            Company’s duties, which are set apart for the use of the board of
                            revenue. The balance, which is far from considerable, is devoted to the
                            maintenance of coast defenses and payment of troops; but as it is
                            inadequate for this purpose, it is supplemented every year by drafts to
                            the amount of several of lacs of taels on the funds which should
                            properly be sent to the provincial capital by the salt commissioner.
                            This state of financial embarrassment, which is the normal condition of
                            the province in ordinary years, is naturally augmented in times of
                            widespread distress like the present; and, as the claims of the board
                            cannot possibly be met in the manner suggested, it becomes necessary to
                            seek for other means of meeting the difficulty. The establishment known
                            as the <hi rend="italic">chih ying chii</hi>, or general accountant’s
                            office, which meets demands for payments on different accounts, has in
                            hand at this moment principal funds which bear interest, and the
                            memorialist would suggest that this fund be drawn upon to the extent of
                            100,000 taels for the purpose above mentioned.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: * * * On the 10th of January I was informed by
                        the British minister, Sir Harry Parkes, and the German chargé d’affaires,
                        Count Tattenbach, that dispatches had been received from their consuls at
                        Canton saying that the Chinese authorities were preparing to obstruct the
                        water approaches to Canton, and that the effect of these obstructions would
                        be to imperil, if not to prevent, navigation. The German consul reported
                        that Whampoa would “be totally blocked.”</p>
                    <p>I telegraphed Mr. Consul Seymour for information, and his reply I inclose.
                        Mr. Seymour, as you will observe, said that there would be “serious
                        obstructions without equivalent benefits.”</p>
                    <p>Two questions arose which in the opinion of the legation required immediate
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>The first was that by the terms of the treaty of Tien-Tsin, 1858, concluded
                        between China and the United States, in Article XXVI, United States vessels,
                        in the event of war between China and other powers, were to have free access
                        and egress in the open ports. “It is further agreed,” says the treaty, “that
                        in case, at any time hereafter, China shall be at war with any foreign
                        nation whatever, and should for that cause exclude such nation from entering
                        her ports, still the vessels of the United States shall not the less
                        continue to pursue their commerce in freedom and security, and to transport
                        goods to and from the ports of the belligerent powers,” &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>The second was that the Chinese authorities, in a time of peace, were
                        performing a belligerent act directed against the commerce of friendly
                        powers, an act which if permitted at Canton would stand as a precedent for
                        closing every port in China.</p>
                    <p>I was not disposed to lay much stress upon the first of these propositions,
                            <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0167"/>or even to make it a matter of
                        serious debate with the Government without asking for your special
                        instructions. To be sure, the stipulations of the treaty are plain. It was
                        made, however, in 1858. Since then the methods of offensive and defensive
                        warfare have been revolutionized. The United States, during the rebellion,
                        saw fit to obstruct the channels in Charleston harbor by sinking ships laden
                        with stone, to secure an effective blockade. Germany, during her latest war
                        with France, protected her Baltic ports with torpedoes. I should have felt
                        some embarrassment in seeking to persuade the yamên that what Germany and
                        the United States regarded as honorable warfare could not be permitted to
                        them.</p>
                    <p>At all events, I should have deemed it wise, before making any representation
                        to the yamem, to have asked the Department for further instructions as to
                        how far my Government was disposed to assert our rights under the article I
                        have quoted.</p>
                    <p>As to the second proposition, I could see no doubt as to my immediate duty.
                        The situation was this: The viceroy of two provinces, a local official, upon
                        his own responsibility, without asking the orders of his Government and
                        without any communication to the foreign powers of such a contemplated act,
                        proposed to do what could only be regarded as an extreme and supreme measure
                        of war, namely, to close a port open to us by the treaties. This was to be
                        done when China was at peace, and before any declaration of war, or even an
                        intention so to declare, had been published. If the obstruction of Canton,
                        under these circumstances, was permitted, without a prompt and decisive
                        protest, there would be no reason why this or a subsequent Government, the
                        Canton viceroy, or the ruler of other provinces should not obstruct and
                        close every port in China. And while it might be said that motives of
                        self-interest and the natural desire of the Chinese to profit out of foreign
                        commerce would render such apprehensions improbable, yet one can never cease
                        to remember that in China there is a powerful and what some observers regard
                        a dominant anti-foreign sentiment, which would regard such a measure as
                        excluding all foreigners from the Empire as an act of the highest
                        patriotism.</p>
                    <p>The question was one which under ordinary circumstances I should have
                        submitted to the diplomatic body. But on account of the relations between
                        China and France, I believed, on reflection, that separate action, and
                        especially in my own capacity as the American representative, would be the
                        most effective in securing the ends of peace. With this view I requested an
                        interview with the ministers of the yamiên. The result was a long
                        conversation, a report of which is inclosed.</p>
                    <p>It would be superfluous to repeat what is written with so much detail in this
                        report.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>There were two points which I especially urged upon the ministers in my
                        conversation. The first was that I came in neither a complaining nor an
                        unfriendly spirit, but to advise their excellencies as to the impropriety of
                        the action taken by the Canton viceroy. And in making this statement I knew
                        that I was expressing the feeling of Sir Harry Parkes and Count Tattenbach.
                        We had no disposition to embarrass China, or even appear to censure an
                        official for doing what he deemed best to defend his country. But, and this
                        was the second point of my argument, we were doing China an office of
                        courtesy. It was her interest, even should there be war, not to throw aside
                        the benefits which international law secures to belligerent powers.
                        Supposing events with France were to impose upon China a supreme
                        contingency, the first duty <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0168"/>of
                        Chinese statesmanship would be to seek the good will of the powers which had
                        no concern in the enterprises and adventures of France. The measure proposed
                        at Canton was aimed at all nations holding commercial relations with China,
                        and not merely France alone. It was, as Mr. Consul Seymour reported, a
                        measure of doubtful utility; to quote his exact words, resulting in “serious
                        obstructions without equivalent benefits.” It would only irritate friendly
                        powers who were bound to protect their commerce and their people, and who
                        could not under any circumstances consent to the abrogation of a treaty by a
                        provincial official.</p>
                    <p>To these and correlative arguments which I pressed upon their excellencies
                        again and again during a long conversation, they replied with a rude logic
                        which was not without force. “If,” they said in substance, “the western
                        powers are well disposed towards China, if your Government is, as you say,
                        friendly, why do you not interfere and compel France to cease her assaults’?
                        If America is China’s true friend, why docs she not show her friendship in
                        this hour of emergency? Here comes the robber with torch and steel to invade
                        our house. You are our guests. Why will you not assist us in keeping the
                        robber out? China has made other nations rich with her trade. She longs to
                        pursue that beneficent pursuit. Why should not those who share these
                        benefits make some return?”</p>
                    <p>It was not difficult to see that other arguments animated the yamên, and in
                        presenting this view of the case I think I am giving the principles
                        underlying the present policy of China towards foreign powers. “Why,” they
                        say, “should China, under any circumstances, make war? Why not compel the
                        foreigner to do so? Great Britain, Germany, Russia, the United States, are
                        dying for our trade. They know that it is an essential factor in their
                        commercial greatness. Without our silk, our tea, and so on, they would be
                        poor indeed. They are great powers, with guns and ships and torpedoes and
                        other inventions. Why, therefore, is it not the highest wisdom to impress
                        upon these nations the peril involved in the withdrawal of the Chinese
                        trade, and thus compel them to save China from the invader?”</p>
                    <p>This theory, deeply rooted in the minds of the ministers and adverted to
                        again and again, as the Department will note in my conversation with their
                        excellencies, made it difficult to come to an understanding, or to divest
                        any advice that could be given as to the impropriety of proceedings like
                        those complained of at Canton of the suspicion of insincerity. If we were
                        friends to China, we should show the efficiency of that friendship by
                        controlling France. There was also the further proposition that China was
                        justified in taking any step to protect her soil. This was the sovereign
                        right of self-preservation. It was difficult to show how, as friendly
                        powers, we should not aid China in opposing an enemy, or, failing in that,
                        how we should contest her own right to do so. The only argument that seemed
                        to make an impression upon the ministers was that China, by doing acts of
                        war in time of peace, which affected the interests of friendly nations, was
                        invoking an opposition from those who wished her well, and whose friendship
                        might not be without its advantages should war ensue with France.</p>
                    <p>My conversation with the ministers was followed by interviews between them
                        and the representatives of Great Britain and Germany. A memorandum of these
                        conversations was given to me by Sir Harry Parkes and Count Tattenbach, and
                        will be found as inclosures. The Department will observe that the position
                        assumed by the legation in presenting our case was confirmed by my British
                        and German colleagues.</p>
                    <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0169"/>
                    <p>Although we could not induce the yamên to give us a formal withdrawal of
                        their policy, nor to make any promise that what had been done at Canton
                        might not be repeated at Shanghai and Tien-Tsin, the practical effect of our
                        joint action was to arrest the obstructions proposed in Canton, and to show
                        the Government that we could not permit what had been attempted as a
                        precedent. I did not feel myself at liberty to go beyond an earnest and at
                        the same time a friendly protest.</p>
                    <p>The point at issue was so important, and the possible action of the yamên so
                        uncertain, that I felt bound to submit it without delay to the Department.
                        This was also done by the British legation. The dispatch of Sir Harry Parkes
                        to Lord Granville, and his lordship’s answer, will be found as
                        inclosures.</p>
                    <p>I also requested Admiral Davis, now at Shanghai, to have some skilled officer
                        examine the nature of the proposed obstruction. Such a report would have a
                        technical value, as that of a professional expert, apart from the judgment
                        of the consular gentlemen upon whose information we act.</p>
                    <p>The correspondence is herewith submitted to the Department. I am persuaded
                        that you will agree with me that, considering, on the one hand, our rights
                        under the treaties, and, on the other, the practical embarrassments which
                        confronted China, wishing under no circumstances to appear harsh and stern,
                        the position taken by the yamên made our duty clear; that this duty was to
                        protest against a grave violation of treaties and of international law. I
                        endeavored to do so in a way that would show the ministers that no nation,
                        under existing forms of civilized society, could venture upon deeds of this
                        nature without doing herself in the end a grave injury; that treaties and
                        international law were made for the common welfare of mankind, and that in
                        their sanctity China had no small share.</p>
                    <p>To have overlooked the action of the Canton viceroy, to have permitted a
                        precedent which at any time, under the reactionary influences possible in
                        China, would have fatally wounded every foreign interest, would, in my
                        opinion, have been a serious neglect of duty. I trust that the action of the
                        legation will meet with your approval.</p>

                                the ministers of the tsung-li yamên, January</hi> 14, 1884.</head>
                        <p>Mr. Young, after the exchange of the-usual courtesies, said to their
                            excellencies that he wished to confer with them in reference to
                            circumstances at Canton as reported to the legation by Mr. Consul
                            Seymour, and to the British and German legations, likewise, by their
                            consular representatives. From these telegrams, the contents of which he
                            submitted to their excellencies, it would appear that the viceroy at
                            Canton had notified the consuls that the river north and south of Dane’s
                            Island would be blocked by the construction of a wooden bridge, and that
                            there would be left for navigation an opening in the bridge seventy
                            Chinese feet, or about eighty feet, in width. The reason assigned for
                            this measure to the British consul was the necessity of having torpedo
                            practice. According to the British consul, this opening in the bridge
                            would be sufficient for the passage of British vessels of war, but
                            insufficient for usual navigation. The German consul reported that the
                            Whampoa and Canton Rivers would be blocked, the one totally, the other
                            with the exception of the passage referred to. The German consul was of
                            the opinion that while the steamship navigation would be difficult, ship
                            navigation would be impossible. The American consul had reported that
                            the reason given by the viceroy for the proposed blockade was to <pb
                                n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0170"/>open communication between the
                            opposite forts and torpedo defenses. In the opinion of the consul, it
                            would be “a serious obstacle without equivalent benefits.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Young said there were two or three considerations of a grave
                            character which he wished to present to their excellencies. At the same
                            time he would like to know how far the news that had been received from
                            these consulates was confirmed by the news in the possession of the
                            yamên.</p>
                        <p>The minister Chang said that the yamên had been told by the viceroy at
                            Canton of his purpose to build certain defenses covering the approaches
                            to Canton, and that these defenses would involve a partial obstruction
                            of the Canton River. But that care would be taken to so build them that
                            foreign commerce and foreign men-of-war could go to and from Canton in
                            safety.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Young said that he much regretted that the information he had laid
                            before their excellencies did not justify this impression. On the
                            contrary, it was the belief of the consular gentlemen whose telegrams he
                            quoted that the practical effect of obstructing the channel as proposed
                            would be to close the port of Whampoa and practically seal up Canton.
                            “Mr. Seymour,” continued Mr. Young, “expressed also the decided opinion
                            that it would ‘be a serious obstruction without equivalent
                            benefits.’”</p>
                        <p>The minister replied that Mr. Seymour’s dispatch seemed to be an
                            extravagant expression of opinion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Young said, as Mr. Seymour had the reputation of holding the
                            viceroy’s confidence, and had been criticised for what were called his
                            “Chinese sentiments,” such an expression, deprecating as it did the
                            viceroy’s action as unnecessary, was entitled to special value. However,
                            on that point Mr. Young did not lay much stress. He knew that Mr.
                            Seymour was not an engineer, and he therefore had requested Admiral
                            Davis to have the character of the proposed obstructions examined by a
                            competent naval officer. That report would have technical and scientific
                            value. What Mr. Young wished, however, to point out to their
                            excellencies was that the Canton viceroy had made a grave error.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>First. The viceroy was committing an act of war in a time of
                                peace, an act of war against neutral and friendly powers who had
                                given China no cause for aggression.</item>
                            <item>Second. He was violating the treaty in this, that while Canton was
                                an open port, as provided in Article XIV of the treaty of Tien-Tsin
                                in 1858, the viceroy proposed to close it.</item>
                            <item>Third. That if the Chinese Government claimed the right to close
                                Canton without due notice to the contracting powers under treaties
                                now in force, there was no reason why Tien-Tsin, New Chwang,
                                Shanghai, Ningpo, Foochow, and every open port should not be closed.
                                This, Mr. Young submitted, involved an assumption of authority on
                                the part of the Chinese that could find no warrant in the
                                treaties.</item>
                            <item>Fourth. That regarding the right of China, as a proper means of
                                defense against an enemy or even as an act of war, to blockade her
                                harbors and channels by artificial obstructions, there remained the
                                stipulations in the convention signed between China and the United
                                States in 1844 and 1858. By Article XXVI of the latter treaty it was
                                expressly declared “that in case, at any time hereafter, China shall
                                be at war with any foreign nation whatever, and shall for that cause
                                exclude such nation from entering her ports, still the vessels of
                                the United States shall not the less continue to pursue their
                                commerce in freedom and security and to transport goods to and from
                                the ports of belligerent powers, full respect being paid to the
                                neutrality of the United States.” To this were added certain
                                restrictions preventing our ships under these circumstances from
                                giving aid to the belligerents against China.</item>
                            <item>Fifth. That while the viceroy was doing an illegal act, and,
                                according to friendly authorities, an act of questionable advantage
                                to the defenses of Canton, he was adding to the cares and
                                perplexities of the Government by creating an issue which could by
                                no possibility strengthen Chinese relations with friendly
                                powers.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The ministers said that “we must regard what was done in Canton as the
                            act of a local official charged with the defense of that port, that he
                            was entitled to defend it in his own way, and that if the yamên were to
                            hamper him with objections and instructions, and if by any chance there
                            resulted mischief to Canton, the yamên and not the viceroy would be
                            answerable to the Emperor with their heads.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Young answered that this was a proposition which could not be
                            accepted for a moment. The foreign ministers were not accredited to the
                            Canton viceroy, but the Emperor of China, and they must transact their
                            business with the ministers of His Majesty.</p>
                        <p>The ministers then replied that the yamên were willing to accept the
                            responsibility of the viceroy’s acts and to defend them upon the highest
                            grounds, namely, the necessity of self-protection. China was now
                            attacked by a foreign power.</p>
                        <p>“By what power?” Mr. Young inquired.</p>
                        <p>“France.”</p>
                        <p>“If you are at war with France,” Mr. Young answered, “why not give the
                            powers notice, so that our Governments can act accordingly? But I do not
                            know that you are at war with France. On the contrary, I am bound to
                            consider the relations between <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0171"
                            />France and China unbroken, especially as I know that Prince Kung paid
                            his annual visit of courtesy and friendship to the French legation a few
                            days ago, and I saw the French flag flying over the French legation an
                            hour ago.”</p>
                        <p>“But,” said the ministers, with some warmth, “the world knows, the
                            diplomatic body knows, that France is at war with China. Hanoi has been
                            taken, Santoi has fallen; French troops are fighting Chinese troops in
                            Tonquin, a Chinese dependency. If you find ground for complaint in the
                            measures of defense at Canton, go to the French, legation.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Young replied that he was not accredited to the French legation, but
                            to the yamên. He wished their excellencies to believe that he did not
                            come in a complaining mood, or to add to the troubles of the yamên. The
                            propositions he had presented arose out of a state of affairs for which
                            the Chinese are responsible, and he was certain the more gravely the
                            ministers considered them the better it would be for the interests of
                            China.</p>
                        <p>“But,” said Chang, “we have had no complaint from the British minister,
                            none from the German minister. They know what has been done in Canton,
                            and both ministers consent.”</p>
                        <p>“I must,” said Mr. Young, “disturb that illusion. These events at Canton
                            have been the subject of earnest conferences between Sir Harry Parkes,
                            Count Tattenbach, and myself, and I am speaking with a full knowledge of
                            their opinions. It was deemed best that I should present to you, in the
                            friendliest and at the same time the most earnest way, our objection to
                            an unfortunate and unlawful policy. I shall not fail to communicate to
                            Sir Harry Parkes and Count Tattenbach what passes in this
                            conference.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Young then repeated the case as presented above, and again read the
                            telegrams detailing what had taken place at Canton.</p>
                        <p>The ministers, speaking through Chang, then went into an elaborate
                            exposition of the Chinese side. In the first place, they said, we must
                            recognize it as a friendly act on the part of the viceroy to notify our
                            consuls. He had made no such notification to the French.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Young interposed by saying that there should be no question of
                            friendliness either on his own part or that of his British and German
                            colleagues. As for himself, and he knew he might venture to say as much
                            for his colleagues, they could not approach China in a friendlier spirit
                            than was now entertained.</p>
                        <p>The minister Chang continued in a long speech, which assumed the form of
                            a declamation, interspersed with metaphors and invectives. China was in
                            the position of a house-owner, a host. This host had three
                            guests—England, Germany, and America. They were living in happy
                            communion. Suddenly the host, China, sees a robber come, France. This
                            robber means to plunder the host, take his life perhaps; it may be,
                            injure his guests. What should the guests do? Plainly combine and help
                            the host turn out the robber. That they will not do. The host then
                            proposes to close one of the doors in his house, Canton, so as to give
                            the robber one less chance of entrance. And the guests now wish to
                            interfere, oppose their host’s plans for protecting his house and his
                            friends, and say that the host shall not hunt and capture the
                            robber.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Young replied that the illustration was interesting; but it failed in
                            one essential point—China had not declared France to be “a robber.” When
                            she did, the guests would do what the laws of nations commanded as just
                            alike to China and France.</p>
                        <p>“Why,” said Chang, “do not neutral powers who have large interests in
                            China, and whose friendship we recognize and accept—why will not
                            England, Russia, Germany, and America unite and compel the French to
                            behave towards China? China wants your friendship, wants to trade with
                            you, wishes you no harm and no harm to France. Why can you not join and
                            compel France to cease molesting China? Give us a guarantee that you
                            will do so and there will be no obstructions.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Young replied that the action thus proposed was of too grave and
                            momentous a character to be discussed by any but the rulers of the
                            nations whose officers were thus invoked. Of course any anxieties their
                            excellencies might entertain as to the safety of China, or perils
                            threatening her peace and autonomy, would be heard with sympathy by
                            friendly powers. But a request like this, even if the granting of it
                            were feasible, could not but be regarded as an admission of weakness on
                            the part of China. It was virtually placing China under the protectorate
                            of the powers named, and Mr. Young did not think their excellencies
                            craved that position. These powers, each and all of them, had their own
                            interests to regard, interests in which France was more or less
                            involved. They were all friends, some allies, of France. The proposed
                            joint intervention did not come within the range of diplomatic
                            possibilities, and if the ministers valued Mr. Young’s opinion on the
                            subject it would be this, that China in making such an appeal was
                            practically offering to surrender her independence, and to admit that
                            she could not protect her Empire.</p>
                        <p>“Again,” said Chang, “what we are doing is in defense of your
                            commerce.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Young said he did not quite see that; but the powers concerned, the
                            United <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0172"/>States certainly, could
                            defend their own commerce, and China should allow no anxiety of that
                            kind to disturb her councils.</p>
                        <p>“You do not,” said Chang, “deny China the right to defend her own
                            territory?”</p>
                        <p>“On the contrary,” Mr. Young answered, “I applaud the right.”</p>
                        <p>“Then what would you have us do to defend our country? Here is the robber
                            coming, coming, coming [with much animation of gesture]; we want to keep
                            him out, we want to close the doors, and you say no! What, under the
                            same circumstances, would America do?”</p>
                        <p>“I will tell your excellency,” Mr. Young replied, “what America would do,
                            what America has done. We should build forts, arm vessels of war, cover
                            the shores of our harbors with batteries, perfect a torpedo system,
                            drill soldiers, plan railways and canals for transportation, call out
                            our people, give them arms, and if the enemy came, fight him. But we
                            shall never, especially in time of peace, obstruct our natural channels
                            of commerce, given by Providence for the good of mankind, and of which
                            there are few enough in the most favored countries. This we should not
                            do in times of peace, and we should do it with reluctance and only as an
                            extreme necessity in time of war.”</p>
                        <p>“But America,” said Chang, “did it as an act of war.”</p>
                        <p>“As an act of war, yes,” Mr. Young replied. “We did it as an act of war
                            against an enemy in Charleston. The circumstances there, although I am
                            speaking to your I excellency from recollection and may not be accurate
                            in minor details, were these: The United States was at war. Her
                            belligerent rights were recognized. Blockades were maintained. Fleets
                            and armies were in motion. The effect of the war was to inflict upon the
                            people of other nations who needed our products for manufactures,
                            England especially, great hardships. These hardships were accepted, as
                            an incident of war, without a protest. We sank ships laden with stones
                            in the channels leading to Charleston. This we did as an act of war. But
                            other nations protested that it was a violation of the laws of nations
                            to seal up permanently a harbor. My Government gave an assurance that
                            the obstructions would be removed when the war ended, and this was
                            done.”</p>
                        <p>“China will do the same,” replied Chang.</p>
                        <p>“But your excellency,” said Mr. Young, “must excuse me if I again, with
                            some emphasis, call your attention to the divergent circumstances. What
                            we did as an act of war, and not without protest from friendly nations,
                            you are doing as an act of peace. Even as a war measure some of the
                            neutral nations might protest, as they did against the United States. We
                            certainly should have the right to do so under the twenty-sixth article
                            of the Tien-Tsin treaty. If other nations have not that same right in
                            their conventions, the favored-nation clause gives it to them. As a
                            consequence, even if war were declared, and we entered upon our duties
                            as neutrals dealing with belligerent powers, the question would still be
                            open. Undoubtedly China in a state of war would receive from foreign
                            friendly powers every consideration as to the means she deemed necessary
                            for self-defense. But supposing the waiving of this article was the
                            result of the forbearance of friendly powers; supposing obstructing your
                            rivers was re-graded as within your rights, despite this treaty; you
                            then might do against an enemy, and not without a protest, what you are
                            doing now against friends.”</p>
                        <p>“But how can you call the capture of Hanoi peace?” asked Chang.</p>
                        <p>“You have not declared war,” said Mr. Young, “and how can we regard it
                            otherwise than as an act that does not concern you? You have remanded
                            the whole business to diplomacy; the Chinese minister is in Paris, the
                            French minister is in Peking. If you are at war, say so, and I will so
                            inform my Government.”</p>
                        <p>“We have,” said Chang, “no evil intention to any country but France.”</p>
                        <p>“Why, then, to annoy France,” Mr. Young asked, “do you an act of
                            questionable value to China, of little moment to France, and which
                            compels remonstrance from friendly powers?”</p>
                        <p>“There is no ground for irritation,” was the reply. “We only block one
                            channel partly, the other not at all.”</p>
                        <p>“Our information,” said Mr. Young, “does not sustain that view. Here are
                            telegrams from three consuls. They agree on one point, namely, that
                            there is obstruction. Laying that aside, however, without asking whether
                            the obstruction is small or great, we must come again to the essential
                            point. If China can in a time of peace obstruct one channel without even
                            communicating her reasons for so doing to the foreign powers, why may
                            she not do the same to every port in China? His excellency must
                            certainly see that to allow this right to go unchallenged is to place
                            every foreign interest in China at the mercy of any viceroy. You
                            obstruct Canton to-day; why may not the viceroy Tsao obstruct Shanghai
                            next day, and the viceroy Li, Tien-Tsin the day following. Millions,
                            many millions, of foreign property in China, under the safeguard of
                            treaties, would by such acts shrivel up in a day.” Mr. Young was not
                            discussing such extreme acts as a probability, but it was a possibility,
                            and diplomacy could not overlook what was possible in a matter so
                            important. It was in assuming this most untenable prerogative that China
                            seemed to have made her gravest blunder.</p>
                        <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0173"/>
                        <p>“Suppose,” replied Chang, “that your Government, with the governments of
                            England, Germany, and Russia, were to guarantee that France would not
                            rush in suddenly and take Canton, or that France would not make war
                            without due notice, so as to give us time to prepare; we could then give
                            you the assurances you wish. What is the use of your being friendly, and
                            of our seeming friendship in England and Germany, if your friendship
                            counts for nothing in this hour of trial?”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Young said that he could not enter upon these questions, however much
                            he might regard them as worthy of sympathy. His excellency made the
                            mistake of supposing that the friendly interest of one power in another
                            meant an obligation to fight its battles. That rule did not prevail in
                            private life, much less was it a principle of international law.
                            Contingencies might arise, as one of the consequences of war, wherein
                            the neutral powers might come to the aid of China, as they came to the
                            aid of Turkey after her war with Russia, compelling Russia to revise the
                            treaty of San Stefano. The friendly neutral powers would serve China so
                            far as it served their own interests. This might seem a cold and selfish
                            declaration, but Governments could not exist upon any other footing. It
                            would naturally follow, therefore, that the true policy of the yamên
                            would be in no way to alienate friendly powers. If the pressure of
                            France upon China were to injure the interests of the maritime powers,
                            they would act without any suggestion from China. There could be no
                            greater folly than to take a course which made such action impossible,
                            and this would certainly be the case were the yamên to follow the policy
                            of the Canton viceroy.</p>
                        <p>“But” replied Chang, “here are the French vessels in Chinese waters,
                            surveying, spying, and why don’t they go away? The French are to blame
                            for it all. We claim the right to close our ports, to defend our
                            country; and if the foreigners complain, we can only answer, Go ask the
                            French! Take the French away! The French are troubling trade; go take
                            them away! It is a matter between you and France; don’t trouble us! We
                            mean to defend our country!”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Young answered that he was sorry to hear these opinions. They could
                            not come to good, and he was sure when he made these sentiments known to
                            his English and German colleagues they would share his regret. It showed
                            a timid and unjust policy on the part of the yamên, one that would not
                            strengthen China in the eyes of foreign nations. If China were a great
                            Empire she could take care of herself without doing wrong to neutral
                            powers. On the contrary, this policy of entreaty, invective, and
                            deprecation could only be regarded as weakness. The yamên called France
                            an enemy. Well, let that be granted; was that any reason why other
                            nations should be treated as enemies, why the American minister should
                            come to-day to protest against an act which his excellency does not deny
                            is an invasion of the treaties and an infraction of international
                            law?</p>
                        <p>“As soon as we have peace,” said Chang, “all will be right.”</p>
                        <p>“But is there war?” Mr. Young inquired. “Will your excellency write me an
                            official note saying that what you have done is an act of war, and will
                            be undone when peace is proclaimed? Or will you authorize me to say to
                            Sir Harry Parkes and Count Tattenbach that China is at war?”</p>
                        <p>The ministers made no answer. Mr. Young again pressed them, and
                            especially upon the point that the right to blockade one river meant to
                            blockade all.</p>
                        <p>“We have not done so,” was the reply. “You have it in your power to end
                            all this. Take the French away from Tonquin or give us an assurance that
                            they will not blockade or burn our ports.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Young said that he was much afraid that the subject was one upon
                            which there could be no further conversation. He was sorry to have so
                            unsatisfactory a report to make to his colleagues. He must now ask
                            Prince Kung to address a note to the diplomatic body or to the American
                            legation explaining his reasons for this action. He would like to have
                            these reasons in an official form, in order that he might give
                            officially the objections he had presented in this conversation.</p>
                        <p>The ministers said at first that they would send the note. After some
                            conference, it occurred to them that any note to the diplomatic body
                            would of necessity include France, and they wished to conceal their
                            purposes from France. They would, therefore, confine their statements to
                            verbal communications with myself and certain of my colleagues.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Young replied that it was a matter of minor consequence, and he did
                            not wish to intrude upon any reserve the yamên thought necessary to use
                            towards the French legation. He must, however, ask their excellencies to
                            take a formal note of the fact that the American legation protested
                            against the act of the Canton viceroy as an express violation of
                            treaties and as the establishment of a precedent which might at any time
                            be fatal to foreign intercourse with China.</p>
                        <p>The ministers, with energy, claimed their right as Chinese to defend
                            their country, a right superior to international law.</p>
                        <p>The discussion was protracted, lasting over two hours. All the points
                            that are embraced in this report were gone over again and again,
                            sometimes with feeling on the part of the ministers, but in the end the
                            tone became friendly and in a certain degree <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74"
                                facs="0174"/>pathetic. The ministers dwelt repeatedly upon “the
                            peaceful disposition of China,” upon “French aggressions,” upon “the
                            duty of foreign friendly powers to show their regard for China by an
                            active interference,” and that upon no nation did this duty devolve more
                            strongly than Great Britain and the United States. The China trade had
                            made these friendly powers rich, and now why should China be abandoned,
                            and not only abandoned, but, when China proposed to defend herself, be
                            assailed by friendly powers?</p>
                        <p>It was difficult to enter upon these arguments, or, at the same time, to
                            refrain from doing so. I said, however, that if their excellencies
                            wished to seek a reason for their helplessness in presence of a supposed
                            foreign enemy, it would be found, perhaps, in the failure of the
                            Imperial Government to avail itself of those agencies which are so
                            highly developed in our western civilization, and upon which western
                            nations depend for development and self-protection. There was no time to
                            enter upon that, however, and Mr. Young merely advanced the suggestion
                            as a reply to any reproach that could be visited upon the neutral powers
                            for their apparent apathy and indifference. We could not change the laws
                            of nations or the relations between nations to meet an emergency in the
                            affairs of China for which we were not responsible. And if, as I
                            sometimes fancied, the diplomatic policy of the yamên was to put some
                            stress upon the neutral powers, in the hope of awakening alarm as to the
                            probable effect war might have upon their trade, in the hope that from
                            that alarm intervention might come, I could imagine no more useless
                            proceeding.</p>
                        <p>The ministers asked Mr. Young if he would present their views to his
                            British and German colleagues, and trusted he would impress upon Sir
                            Harry Parkes and Count Tattenbach the fact that what they had done in
                            Canton was in no sense unfriendly. They wished very much to retain the
                            friendly regard of those ministers, and hoped Mr. Young would so present
                            their case as to strengthen their friendship.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Young said this was hardly necessary. He knew of no two ministers who
                            had friendlier feelings toward China than his colleagues. Mr. Young
                            would report to them what had taken place, and as his report would be
                            discouraging and unsatisfactory, their excellencies would soon have an
                            opportunity of meeting the representatives of Great Britain and Germany
                            in person. Mr. Young brought the interview to an end by saying that he
                            would telegraph the substance of what had been done to his Government,
                            and await instructions before venturing further observations.</p>

                        <p>Sir Harry Parkes, accompanied by Messrs. Hillier and Everard, called by
                            appointment at the yamên, and was received by the ministers Ch’en, Wu,
                            and Chang.</p>
                        <p>Sir Harry Parkes explained to their excellencies that, as he had
                            mentioned in his letter asking for an interview, Mr. Young, the United
                            States minister, had informed him of what had passed at his visit to the
                            yamên on the previous day, and in consequence of their excellencies’
                            remarks on that occasion he had felt it his duty to call and clearly
                            explain to them on his part that in obstructing the navigation of a
                            treaty port in time of peace the Chinese Government were taking a step
                            which was illegal, unnecessary, and injurious to the interests of
                            friendly powers.</p>
                        <p>Chang-ta-jên, who was the chief speaker throughout the interview, said
                            that he had hoped that the explanations given to Mr. Hillier when he
                            called at the yamên on the 12th instant, together with their
                            conversation of the previous day with Mr. Young, would have been
                            sufficient to have placed Sir Harry Parkes in full possession of the
                            views of the yamên upon this subject. Before proceeding to any further
                            discussion of the question he would like to ask Sir Harry Parkes whether
                            the object of his present visit was to obtain further information or to
                            find fault.</p>
                        <p>Sir Harry Parkes replied that he had come to tell the ministers that the
                            step taken by the viceroy at Canton was illegal in itself, was useless
                            as a defensive measure, and was injurious to British and foreign
                            interests generally. It was illegal because no country had a right to
                            close her ports except in case of war, it was useless because it was a
                            most imperfect means of defense, and it was injurious because one port
                            had been completely closed and the access to another had been
                            considerably obstructed.</p>
                        <p>Chang-ta-jên rejoined that it could not be illegal for China to take
                            measures for her own safety. In the face of all that had occurred it was
                            incumbent on the Government to make preparations for threatened
                            aggression by the French, and it was difficult to say that France was
                            not at war with China, though no formal declaration of war had been
                            made. China herself was loath to declare war, for she was not prepared
                            to assume the offensive against France, and it was to be assumed that it
                            was not the <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0175"/>wish of neutral
                            powers that she should do so; but the action of the latter in Tonquin
                            and their intention to seize Hainan, Formosa, Chusan, and other places
                            in China, as telegraphed by the Marquis Tsêng and communicated from
                            other sources, were sufficient to justify the assumption that France
                            intended to make war on China. The previous conduct of France did not
                            entitle her to being credited with respect for international law, and it
                            was always possible that she might make a sudden descent upon Canton. It
                            was to guard against such a descent that the precautions complained of
                            had been taken by the viceroy of the two Kwang provinces.</p>
                        <p>As regarded the legality of the measure, the yamên maintained that as
                            trade was not obstructed, but only slightly impeded, the Chinese
                            Government could not be accused of blocking the ports. The Whampoa
                            Channel was required for torpedo practice, and the Chinese Government
                            was justified in barring it to foreign ships on this ground alone. Apart
                            from this consideration, the viceroy at Canton was in supreme command,
                            and the yamên could not interfere with any arrangements he might see fit
                            to make as a protection against invasion. The powers of a military
                            commander-in-chief in China were necessarily large, as he might have to
                            answer with his life for any error of judgment or tactics. Sir Harry
                            Parkes would readily perceive that if the yamên were to interfere with
                            his arrangements, the viceroy might, reasonably or not, attribute his
                            failure to their interference. They could not, therefore, take upon
                            themselves to fetter his action so long as he did not infringe the
                            treaties, which they considered he had not done.</p>
                        <p>As regarded the injury done to foreign interests, while they maintained
                            that this was not at present grave, the ministers considered that the
                            Chinese Government was entitled to some consideration. The subjects of
                            friendly powers in China might justly be expected to share in her
                            fortunes and reverses, and it was simply out of consideration for
                            foreign interests that access to Canton had not been entirely shut
                            off.</p>
                        <p>Sir Harry Parkes considered that the yamên were bound to interfere
                            precisely because the viceroy was infringing the treaties—he did not say
                            intentionally, but from a mistaken view of his duty—and it was to the
                            central Government that the British Government must look for a
                            rectification of the mistake. Torpedo practice could not be assigned as
                            a justification of the measure, as that practice could be carried on
                            elsewhere without injury to foreign interests. He was fully alive to the
                            difficulty that the Chinese Government was placed in, but he was bound
                            to point out to them that their difficulties would be increased by
                            persistence in a course which was useless as well as injurious. The
                            blocking of rivers was an obsolete measure in modern warfare. The main
                            defenses of the Canton River were practically those at the entrance at
                            the Bogue, and it was there that precautions ought to be taken. If
                            defenses were required within the course of the river between the Bogue
                            and Canton, these need not involve the obstruction of that limited
                            portion of it which formed the port of Whampoa. A point two or three
                            miles above the one chosen by the viceroy would have been as effective
                            for defense and would have left the port free. The ministers must be
                            aware of the friendly intentions by which the British Government were
                            actuated, sentiments which, he might add, were shared by Germany and the
                            United States, but he could assure them that if the Chinese Government
                            persisted in inflicting avoidable injury on foreign interests, the
                            sympathy of neutral powers in this unfortunate difference would be
                            alienated from China and proportionately transferred to her
                            opponent.</p>
                        <p>Chang-ta-jên having asked whether he understood Sir Harry Parkes to say
                            that there would be no objection to the channel at the Bogue forts being
                            blocked, his excellency was told that there was no necessity to block
                            that or any other channel open to foreign navigation unless war were
                            actually declared. The blocking of a port was a destructive, not a
                            defensive measure. The passage of the Bogue or any other passage could
                            be closed by torpedoes in a few hours, but all passages open to
                            international commerce should certainly be left open until a state of
                            war had been proclaimed, and no nation could assume the offensive
                            previous to a formal declaration of war.</p>
                        <p>This, said Chang-ta-jên, was the very point he wished to arrive at. If
                            China could be certain that France would be guided by the laws of war in
                            her future action, and an authoritative assurance could be obtained from
                            any quarter that France would not attack without due notice,
                            Chang-ta-jên would promise, on his own responsibility, that the
                            obstruction at Canton should be removed.</p>
                        <p>Sir Harry Parkes having observed that the minister could not expect to
                            receive such an assurance from himself, went on to say that in pressing
                            his contention he was influenced by the consideration that there was a
                            grave principle involved. What was done at one port might be done at
                            others, and thus the large commercial interests of Great Britain and
                            other neutral powers in China might at any moment be jeopardized.</p>
                        <p>Chang-ta-jên rejoined that the neutral powers ought to address themselves
                            to France, who was responsible for all the inconveniences to which they
                            were or might be put, and they should bring their influence to bear to
                            effect a settlement of the question <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76"
                                facs="0176"/>at issue. His excellency knew, he said, of the
                            existence of a secret compact between the neutral powers to protect the
                            treaty ports in case of war.</p>
                        <p>Sir Harry Parkes was ignorant of any such compact as that referred to by
                            Chang-ta-jên. The only compact that he had any knowledge of was an
                            understanding between four powers to co-operate in the protection of
                            their respective subjects and citizens at the treaty ports—protection,
                            it should be observed, against aggressive acts on the part of the
                            Chinese populace, not against the action of a belligerent. The ministers
                            might be satisfied that as soon as France took any illegal step which
                            was prejudicial to British interests a protest would be at once made. So
                            far no such action had been taken by France; and in any case such a
                            protest would be addressed to the French Government direct, just as Sir
                            Harry Parkes’s present protest had been made direct to the Chinese
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Chang-ta-jên had referred to the influence that the British Government
                            could bring to bear in inducing the French to come to some understanding
                            about the question at issue. The ministers of the yamên must surely
                            remember that they had distinctly declined to accept the good offices of
                            the British Government when these were offered to them four months ago,
                            a fact which Sir Harry Parkes greatly regretted at the time.</p>
                        <p>The ministers at first denied all knowledge of any such offer having been
                            made, and declared that the Marquis Tsêng had never reported the
                            particulars of his visit to Lord Granville and the conversations that
                            had taken place at Walmer Castle with reference to Tonquin affairs, but
                            they eventually receded from this position and said that Chang-ta-jên’s
                            reference to the influence of the British Government was not meant to
                            imply mediatory action, but a recommendation to France to abandon the
                            untenable position she had assumed.</p>
                        <p>The conversation above reported was continued for over two hours, the
                            Chinese ministers repeating again and again that they were justified in
                            taking the step which was complained of, and meeting Sir Harry Parkes’s
                            reiterated protest with a denial of the justice of his arguments.</p>
                        <p>Sir Harry Parkes finally informed their excellencies that, having said
                            all that there was to be said on the subject, he must beg them to make a
                            note of his formal protest against the action of the viceroy at Canton,
                            and to remember that this protest had been made if that action should
                            entail the serious complications he apprehended. He should consider it
                            his duty to report to Her Majesty’s Government, by telegraph, that one
                            approach to Canton had been completely blocked, another partially so,
                            and that the anchorage at Whampoa had been closed to foreign vessels;
                            that this measure was not only seriously detrimental to mercantile
                            interests, but that it was also useless as a defensive precaution and
                            was unjustifiable in a time of peace.</p>
                        <p>Chang-ta-jên replied that the yamên would also telegraph to the Marquis
                            Tsêng instructing him to lay the state of the case before Her Majesty’s
                            secretary of state for foreign affairs. His excellency produced a
                            telegram from the viceroy at Canton to show that the latter had already
                            informed the Marquis Tsêng by telegraph of the action it was proposed to
                            take, and he asked Sir Harry Parkes to add to his telegram the answer of
                            the yamên to his objections. This answer was in sum that one channel of
                            the Canton River was blocked as a precaution against the enemy, one
                            channel was left open for purposes of trade. France was on the verge of
                            making war on China, as was proved by the reports telegraphed by the
                            Marquis Tseng to the effect that the French proposed to seize Hainan,
                            make a descent on Kwangtung (Canton), and take possession of Formosa,
                            Chusan, and other places.</p>
                        <p>Sir Harry Parkes asked on what authority the Marquis Tsêng had reported
                            these alleged intentions. He (Sir Harry Parkes) had seen rumors to this
                            effect in the newspapers, but he thought that these reports should not
                            be accepted as fact on the authority of newspaper statements alone.</p>
                        <p>The ministers replied that the Marquis Tseng might have been influenced
                            by what he had seen in the French press, but, taking his reports in
                            connection with what they had heard from other sources, the ministers
                            considered there was some foundation for the intentions attributed to
                            the French. Of course Sir Harry Parkes would regard this information as
                            confidential.</p>
                        <p>After some further discussion Sir Harry Parkes assented to add the
                            substance of the reply of the yamên to his telegram, but urged that the
                            ministers should fully explain the grounds of their action in their
                            instructions to the Marquis Tseng, for communication to Her Majesty’s
                            Government. He warned their excellencies that Her Majesty’s Government,
                            as far as he could judge, would not regard their action in this matter
                            as satisfactory, and the ministers must kindly remember that he had been
                            guided by a most friendly spirit in advising them to abandon a line of
                            action which was calculated to be of no service to themselves, and
                            which, as he believed, would add considerably to their
                            embarrassments.</p>

                        <p>The imperial chargé d’affairês paid a visit to the tsung-li yamên to-day,
                            accompanied by Mr. Arendi, interpreter to the legation, and found there
                            present the ministers Chen-lan-pin Wu-ting-fên, and Chang-pei-lun. He
                            informed the ministers that, according to news which had reached him
                            from the German consulate at Canton, the governor-general there had
                            ordered the closing of the northern branch of the river leading to
                            Canton, whereby the sailing-ship anchorage at Whampoa will be entirely
                            cut off from communications. He held that the governor-general was not
                            legally authorized to close a port which was open by treaty. He
                            therefore found himself obliged to protest against this measure, and to
                            intimate that the Chinese Government would be held responsible for any
                            injury which might thereby accrue to German subjects.</p>
                        <p>Chang-pei-lun replied that, according to the view of the Chinese
                            Government, the responsibility for the effects of the step which the
                            viceroy had notified, a step which was certainly unusual in time of
                            peace, attached not to China, but rather to France, which had, without
                            declaring war, committed, and was continuing to commit, a number of acts
                            against China which were hostile and only admissible in time of war.
                            Under these circumstances it must at least be allowed to the latter
                            power to defend herself against further attacks on the part of France,
                            and to take at once the precautionary measures which were imperatively
                            necessary, for who could tell whether France might not suddenly make an
                            attack upon Canton, even without a declaration of war? Moreover,
                            continued the minister, the proposed measure would not hinder
                            navigation, or would only do so to an insignificant degree; it would be
                            only transitory, and could, in fact, be regarded in no other light than
                            perhaps the temporary closing of a street in need of repairs, which also
                            momentarily caused slight inconvenience. The minister then laid before
                            the imperial chargê d’affaires a copy of the telegram which he said the
                            yamên had received from the viceroy of Canton with reference to the
                            measures in question.</p>
                        <p>The minister pointed out that, according to this telegram, obstruction to
                            navigation did not appear to exist. Be that, however, as it might,
                            precautionary measures were demanded for Canton much more urgently than
                            elsewhere—on the one hand, because of the neighborhood of the coast of
                            Annam, whence the French fleet could reach Canton in a few days, and, on
                            the other hand, in view of the question which was openly debated in the
                            French press as to the advisability of occupying Chinese territory, for
                            example, the island of Hainan, as a guarantee for a war indemnity to be
                            paid by China.</p>
                        <p>The imperial chargé d’affaires replied that it was far from his intention
                            to contest the right of China to take those measures which seemed
                            necessary for the defense of her frontiers from a possible hostile
                            attack. But it appeared to him that the defense of Canton especially
                            could be sufficiently prepared by other means, without its being
                            necessary to interrupt navigation. The Chinese Government must perceive
                            that by interrupting navigation at Canton in time of peace and without
                            necessity they might easily offend the neutral powers, the more so that
                            the treaty powers would not be able to divest themselves of the
                            apprehension that as Canton was closed to-day, so to-morrow other ports
                            more important to commerce would be closed without sufficient reason. He
                            therefore begged the ministers to send instructions to the viceroy of
                            Canton to make the measures for military defense accord with the just
                            claims which the treaty powers were entitled to make with reference to
                            the non-obstruction of trade and navigation.</p>
                        <p>Chang-pei-lun replied that as the viceroy was answerable for the defense
                            of Canton, the tsung-li yamên could not give him any directions without
                            burdening themselves with a responsibility which could not be incurred
                            without the gravest hesitation. He would candidly avow that had he been
                            viceroy of Canton he would have preferred not to resort to the measure
                            under discussion. The tsung-li yauiên would indeed agree to go so far as
                            to make a representation to the viceroy in the sense that they would
                            submit to his consideration whether it were advisable to raise up three
                            enemies, in addition to the one which existed already, by certain
                            measures, although more or less warrantable under the circumstances. But
                            the yamên could neither themselves give an order to arrest the proposed
                            measures nor could they memorialize the throne with a view to obtaining
                            such an order, for in case Canton were really lost the yainên would in
                            that event be properly chargeable with the blame.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the other ports besides Canton, he would give an assurance
                            that the Chinese Government did not at present contemplate closing them.
                            Should, however, similar precaution become necessary at other places,
                            every imaginable regard would be paid to the interests of navigation and
                            commerce. The uninterrupted continuance of trade was in fact of the
                            greatest importance to China, for the latter, as he would frankly
                            confess, was more than ever in need, in these hard times, of the <pb
                                n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0178"/>duties paid by foreign trade.
                            Should, indeed, added the minister, the neutral powers be willing to
                            induce France to declare that she would not attack the Chinese ports,
                            China would not hesitate on her part to give a formal declaration
                            binding herself not to obstruct trade and navigation in any of the open
                            ports.</p>
                        <p>The imperial chargé d’affaires answered that he was not in a position to
                            discuss this point, upon which Chang-pei-lun remarked that his
                            suggestion was only made in jest.</p>
                        <p>Chang-pei-lun then continued that China had no intention of declaring war
                            against France. If, however, China were prohibited from taking the
                            necessary precautions, she might be driven to a declaration of war. It
                            was, indeed, useless to think of coming to an amicable understanding
                            with France so long as the latter did not put a stop to her hostile
                            action in Tonquin.</p>
                        <p>Chang-pei-lun then gave a new turn to the conversation by thanking the
                            imperial chargé d’affaires, in the name of his colleagues, for his
                            friendly attitude, but at the same time gave expression to his concern
                            that Sir Harry Parkes appeared to consider the affair from a harsher
                            point of view than the imperial chargé d’affaires or the American
                            minister. The telegram which Sir Harry Parkes had intended sending to
                            his Government was very strongly worded and had contained, among other
                            things, the expression that the Chinese Government had closed the port
                            of Canton without reason, when war did not exist. The yamên has
                            requested Sir Harry Parkes rather to express it that the Chinese
                            Government, in a moment when war might at any moment break out, had
                            found itself obliged, &amp;c. The dispatch of any telegram at all by Sir
                            Harry Parkes on this question was indeed highly unsatisfactory to the
                            yamên. Perhaps it might even be yet possible to induce Sir Harry Parkes
                            to renounce his intention of sending the telegram. Would it not be
                            feasible, at any rate, for the imperial chargé d’affaires, in
                            conjunction with Mr. Young, to talk it over with Sir Harry Parkes, and
                            endeavor to induce the latter to take a milder view? In this case it
                            would be agreeable to the ministers to meet Sir Harry Parkes, Mr. Young,
                            and the imperial chargé d’affaires together, which would serve the
                            purpose of removing any unsatisfactory feeling in connection with the
                            subject under consideration.</p>
                        <p>The imperial chargé d’affaires expressed his willingness to communicate
                            the substance of the conversation which he had had to-day to Sir Harry
                            Parkes, and to verbally inform the yamên of the result of his conference
                            with the British minister.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that I am
                            in receipt of the following representation from the members of the
                            central board of military affairs for the province of Kwangtung:</p>
                        <p>“We have respectfully to observe that two defense camps having now been
                            established on the Canton River at the port called Pak T’u Kong [eastern
                            part of Dane’s Island], means must be found of effecting free
                            communication between them across the river, for the convenience of
                            traffic. Further, a torpedo establishment having been set up at Whampoa,
                            where torpedo practice is constantly carried on, means should also be
                            taken for blocking the passage of the river at this point, in order to
                            prevent injury to vessels from striking against the torpedoes on their
                            passage up or down. After consultation with General Wu, commanding the
                            Huai force, it has been proposed to construct a wooden bridge for the
                            passage of the troops over the river between a point near the west ridge
                            of Pak T’u Kong and Sha Lu [south bank of Dane’s Island and opposite
                            bank].</p>
                        <p>“As, however, there is continuous traffic of junks at this point, and the
                            greater part of the foreign steamers entering the Canton River also use
                            this route, it is proposed to leave a passage 6 or 7 chang in width (60
                            or 70 Chinese feet) in the middle of the bridge, where the water is
                            deep, for the convenience of such vessels.</p>
                        <p>“The route by Whampoa has not hitherto been employed by the larger
                            foreign vessels coming up or going down the river, and since torpedo
                            practice is now constantly going on, the free passage of the river there
                            cannot but be barred, in order to prevent accidents to the shipping.
                            Accordingly, after consultation with Major Huang Ch’un Yo, in command of
                            the commissioned junk fleet, it has been arranged that the whole breadth
                            of the river from Tû Chu (Louisa Island) and T’ou Sha (Flat Island No.
                            4) shall be completely closed and access barred by a vessel stationed on
                            the spot, and other impediments, with a view to preventing damage being
                            done to vessels by the explosion of torpedoes.</p>
                        <p>“The various communications and instructions having been issued, it is
                            our duty to <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0179"/>draw up a
                            representation on the subject, requesting that orders maybe given that
                            the various defense corps on land and water be duly informed, and also
                            that communications be addressed to the members of the consular body, in
                            order that they may notify all steamers that such vessels must, when
                            ascending the river, use the Sha Lu route, that they must avoid
                            collision with the wooden bridge, and must no longer use the route by Tû
                            Chu (Louisa Island), in order to avoid injury.”</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, on receipt of the foregoing, I have sent out the necessary
                            communications, and have now the honor to address a request to you that
                            you will give instructions to steamers belonging to subjects of your
                            flag to conform to the above.</p>

                    <p>It is a gratification to know that the cases at issue have been adjusted to
                        the satisfaction of the missionaries whose rights had been in peril. I could
                        not, however, refrain from expressing the shadow of a regret that the
                        settlement did not, in addition to the money payment, carry with it a
                        guarantee from the viceroy that efforts would be made to deter the lawless
                        people from further outrages. Such a guarantee I would have found in the
                        arrest of the principal offenders and the issue of a proper
                        proclamation.</p>
                    <p>As, in reference to the Ngchow case, I received from Prince Kung, in August,
                        an assurance that orders had been sent to arrange it on terms satisfactory
                        to the legation, and as I now learn from Mr. Seymour that the question
                        remains in abeyance, I have sent him a copy of the prince’s dispatch and
                        requested him to confer with the viceroy.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that
                            several matters involving claims of American Presbyterian and native
                            Baptist, or American Baptist, missions, for losses sustained at the
                            hands of Chinese mobs, have been satisfactorily adjusted, and will no
                            longer encumber this consulate or the United States legation with
                            correspondence or negotiations for settlements.</p>
                        <p>The first one to which I will refer was the case of outrages by the
                            Chinese mob against the mission and missionaries and native members and
                            attendants of the American Presbyterian mission at Chik Hom, where a
                            small loss, of about 33 taels, occurred, but where the American
                            missionaries were rudely treated, and where the native friends of that
                            mission were persecuted with much cruelty and brutality. The disturbance
                            was in June, 1883.</p>
                        <p>References to this case were made in my August (1883) correspondence
                            lists. Under date of August 1, 1883, I mentioned having received a
                            statement of these outrages at Chik Hom, from Rev. H. V. Noyes, who,
                            with Rev. B. C. Henry, had full knowledge of the occurrences which I
                            forwarded to the grain intendant (August 4, 1883), who gave the business
                            prompt attention.</p>
                        <p>The troubles of August and September in Canton temporarily overshadowed
                            the Chik Hom affair; but with reasonable promptness appropriate
                            proclamations were made by the authorities in the vicinity of the Chik
                            Hom mission, and early in October the chapel was reopened and the
                            missionaries notified by the local magistrate of a desire to make full
                            restitution, which was duly made to the satisfaction of the friends of
                            the mission.</p>
                        <p>In December, 1883, considerable wrath was manifested in Canton and
                            surrounding country against foreigners and Christians, and there seemed
                            to be simultaneous acts on the part of the natives indicative of a
                            strong purpose to demolish all missions.</p>
                        <p>The week of the imperial commissioner Pang’s arrival in Canton, with
                            several regiments of soldiers from Northern and Central China, and the
                            publication and circulation of many thousands of Chinese documents,
                            purporting to have been issued by that high official, with the sanction
                            and approval of the Emperor, against foreigners, is memorable. That was
                            in the first week of December, 1883, and will long be remembered by all
                            who witnessed the excitement among the natives and anxiety among
                            foreigners.</p>
                        <p>The churches, chapels, and missions of all denominations and
                            nationalities, as well as the property of all foreigners, were in
                            jeopardy until the Chinese authorities (at the urgent suggestion of the
                            United States consul, in advance of the united action of the consular
                            corps, whose services were in requisition by foreigners of various
                            nationalities) took vigorous measures to counteract the serious measures
                            and effects of an ill-advised proclamation, which has never yet been
                            repudiated, although its circulation has been declared
                            “unauthorized.”</p>
                        <p>The only religious establishment which was actually injured in Canton at
                            that time was the “Preaching Hall” of native Christians, in connection
                            with the American <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0181"/>Baptist
                            missions, and that has been repaired, reopened, and occupied, without
                            further troubles or threats.</p>
                        <p>Proclamations from the viceroy and the Hanhoi magistrate, as well as from
                            the imperial commissioner, and military protection, assured all
                            concerned that such atrocities as the destruction of chapels and the
                            molestation of foreigners by natives would not be permitted by the
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>Numerous other chapels, that had been closed for several days under
                            threats from the populace, were reopened under assurances of protection
                            by Chinese officials.</p>
                        <p>While matters were quieting down in Canton, the excitement of the first
                            week of December in this city had extended into the country.</p>
                        <p>At Sheklung (about 60 miles east of Canton) the American Presbyterian
                            missionaries, Rev. B. C. Henry and W. J. White, of Canton, were holding
                            religious services with the members and friends of the mission at that
                            place, on Sunday, December 16, 1883, when a native mob assaulted the
                            chapel and the missionaries and persecuted the native. Christians, until
                            the chapel was unfit for use and the missionaries fled to save their
                            lives. After the outrages against the American Presbyterian mission had
                            been perpetrated, the Chinese mob proceeded to the French Roman Catholic
                            mission and destroyed its chapel and the buildings occupied by the
                            priests and leading members of the Roman Catholic Church, whose priest
                            was conveyed for safety by a mandarin’s boat to Canton, to which place
                            the American missionaries and a native preacher in the employ of the
                            Berlin mission went for safety. Considerable personal violence
                            occurred.</p>
                        <p>A reference to the letter-lists of this consulate will show I laid the
                            Sheklung case before the viceroy December 17, 1883, and before the
                            United States legation in No. 45, dated the 11th January ultimo,
                            eliciting due attention.</p>
                        <p>I have the pleasure of stating that a military officer from Canton last
                            week went to Sheklung and paid up in full all claims for indemnity, the
                            American Presbyterian mission receiving $370.</p>
                        <p>The claim of and indemnity to the Roman Catholics amounted to about 3,000
                            taels. The French consul in Canton has no advices of payment yet, but
                            the money is ready, as Rev. Mr. Noyes, American Presbyterian missionary,
                            informs me.</p>
                        <p>Please take into consideration the fact that the settlement of the
                            several claims herein stated by remittance through the official channels
                            (legation and consulate) could not have been accomplished without
                            prolonged negotiations and circuitous processes and ways, involving
                            months or years of delay, or interruption or suspension of missionary
                            labors.</p>
                        <p>Apart from such inconveniences to all immediately concerned, it is very
                            evident that the moral effect of prompt settlement for damages, and
                            early resumption of missionary work, is greatly to the advantage of
                            those who are engaged as missionaries and preachers or co-workers in
                            religious organizations in China.</p>
                        <p>If it is possible to bring that Ngchow case to a final settlement, it is
                            very desirable that it may be settled; for no attempt can be made to
                            resume missionary work at Ngchow while the unfriendly natives indulge
                            the prevalent idea that destruction and pillage of chapels,
                            dispensaries, and dwellings occupied by foreigners and missionaries is
                            cheap sport.</p>
                        <p>The viceroy Tseng, while here, did not act upon any case that was brought
                            before him touching interests of foreigners, except in the admirably
                            prompt suppression of the Honam (South Canton) riot in August, 1883.</p>
                        <p>The present viceroy, Chang, does not seem to be inclined to
                            procrastinate, but acts more promptly.</p>
                        <p>Having reported the Ngchow case to the legation and to the State
                            Department, and been informed by the latter that it had been placed in
                            the hands of the United States minister for settlement, I do not feel at
                            liberty to interfere with it, especially as I went through a long siege
                            in regard to it, and completely exhausted or upset their subterfuges as
                            to provocation, all of which has been set forth fully in my No. 19,
                            dated May 15, 1883, and its inclosures, including correspondence between
                            this consulate and the viceroy. There is positively no defense.</p>
                        <p>Affixed is a letter from Rev. H. V. Noyes in regard to the settlement of
                            the Sheklung affair, and designated A.</p>
                        <p>Affixed also is an extract from the annual report of the American

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge your
                            dispatch No. 63, dated March 3, 1884, in reference to the action of the
                            consulate in securing from the Chinese authorities a proper compensation
                            for injuries inflicted upon the missionaries by Chinese mobs.</p>
                        <p>It is a gratification to know that by your energy and skill you have
                            received this compensation. So long as the gentlemen in the missionary
                            work are satisfied with what has been done by the Chinese authorities,
                            there might be reasons why it would be well to let the matter rest. It
                            seems to the legation, however, that in these questions we have to
                            consider not alone indemnity for the present, but security for the
                            future. The mere payment of sums of money enough to cover the actual
                            losses of the missionaries may, as the legation can well see, satisfy
                            gentlemen who look upon these acts of violence with a gentle, forgiving
                            spirit, and are disposed, from the traditions of their faith, to welcome
                            rather than deplore any experience that may entail suffering in defense
                            of their faith. But while this sentiment merits our respect, and, I
                            might even say, reverence, embarrassments must arise from a policy which
                            taught the Chinese to believe that a money indemnity would satisfy the
                            Government for a wrong done to its citizens.</p>
                        <p>When, as was seen recently within your consular jurisdiction, there was a
                            riot stimulated by causes for which the Chinese were not to blame, and
                            which the authorities strove to suppress, I believe that the Chinese
                            Government was entitled to leniency and consideration. The causes were a
                            part of the case, more specially as the causes involved acts of murder.
                            But after reading the papers to which your dispatch refers I can see no
                            extenuating circumstances. While I recognize that the authorities in
                            Canton have made reparation in a pecuniary sense for the outrages of the
                            mobs, I do not think that the safety of our citizens can be assured
                            unless, when cases of this kind arise, something is done that will, as
                            far as lies within the power of the authorities, prevent a repetition of
                            similar outrages.</p>
                        <p>Having accepted the awards of the authorities as a full satisfaction for
                            the losses of the missionaries, I am afraid it would serve no practical
                            result to reopen the question now, and especially at a time when the
                            public temper of Canton is in a state of abnormal excitement and the
                            authorities are burdened with special cares. This, however, I must leave
                            largely to your discretion; but in your conversation with the viceroy
                                <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0183"/>and other officials you may
                            say that it is a matter of regret to the legation that steps were not
                            taken to deter the unruly spirits who comprised the mob from similar
                            outrages. Proclamations should have been issued pointing out the gravity
                            of the offense, and especially that American citizens are alike under
                            the protection of the laws of China and the treaties.</p>
                        <p>Should you have any other questions of this nature, I beg you to keep in
                            mind these considerations in your dealings with the authorities.</p>
                        <p>I am, &amp;c.,</p>

                            last from his imperial highness Prince Kung. In this you will note that
                            orders had been sent by the cabinet to Canton giving directions for the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: Some time since I received a
                            dispatch from your excellency in regard to a chapel at Ngchow, in
                            Kwanghsi. I at once instructed the provincial authorities concerned to
                            investigate the business, and so informed you.</p>
                        <p>I am now in receipt of a report, in which it is stated that a Cantonese
                            of the Rao Yao district, named Fang Chun Chang, came in an irregular
                            manner, and without credentials, to Ngchow to preach. He also loosely
                            asserted himself to be a physician and caused the death of several
                            persons by malpractice. The anger of the populace was in consequence
                            excited and the residence of Fang was destroyed. The acting magistrate
                            at once sent a force of soldiers to repress the riot and preserve order.
                            An investigation developed the facts recited above, and nothing was said
                            about any losses On account of Fang’s character as a preacher, the
                            magistrate was desirous of protecting him from all harm, and had him
                            escorted in a boat outside the limits of the district.</p>
                        <p>Thereafter Fang Chun Chang returned, bringing with him two Americans,
                            Messrs. Simmons and Noyes, who declared that property to the value of
                            160 taels was lost at the time the house was torn down by the mob, and
                            they asked payment to this amount, and that the house be rebuilt for
                            preaching purposes. They also stated that the person who caused the
                            deaths by malpractice was a different person from Fang; his name was
                            Chang, and he had been sent there by the missionaries. Another mob
                            arose, but the magistrate in person led a force to repress it. Learning
                            that the missionaries desired to proceed to the Feng district, the
                            magistrate escorted them on their way. Fang Chun Chang went with them,
                            and they did not return to Ngchow. Positive orders have been issued for
                            the settlement of the business, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>In this case since it appears that a Chinese subject named Fang Chun
                            Chang falsely pretended to be a preacher and caused the death of several
                            persons, and thereafter imposed upon the foreigners by means of false
                            and malicious statements, the matter must be thoroughly sifted to the
                            bottom, that justice may be done.</p>
                        <p>The yamên has ordered the provincial authorities to arrest Fang Chun
                            Chang and to make careful examination and settle the ease.</p>
                        <p>Cards and compliments.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my dispatch No. 297, dated November 30,
                        1883, I informed the Department that I had on that date sent a circular note
                        to the gentlemen in our consular service asking them to send me certain
                        information in reference to the petroleum trade in China during the year
                        1883, an more especially as to whether there was any renewal of efforts on
                        the part of the authorities to suppress the trade by repressive
                        proclamations.</p>
                    <p>I have received reports from all the consulates with the exception of Amoy. *
                        *</p>
                    <p>It was my duty to address special instructions to Mr. Win gate, at Foo-Chow,
                        and Mr. Seymour, at Canton, expressive of the views of the legation as to
                        special circumstances which had arisen within their jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>Certain facts appear which I may venture to summarize.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cheshire sends a valuable table showing, as a part of the movement of
                        petroleum in Shanghai, the import of oils into open ports chiefly supplied
                        from Shanghai during the year 1883. From this it appears that there has been
                        anincrease at Tien-Tsin, Kiu-Kiang, Hankow, Wuhu, and Chin-Kiang; a decrease
                        at New Chwang, Chefoo, Ningpo, Wênchow, and the country around Shanghai. The
                        increase amounts to 101,944 gallons, the decrease to 62,997, showing a net
                        increase of 38,947.</p>
                    <p>These figures can hardly be accepted as a test, although, as Shanghai is an
                        important distributing point, they have value. Mr. Cheshire has not had
                        occasion to complain of the proclamations against the use of petroleum in
                        Shanghai, which gave Consul-General Denny so much annoyance. The authorities
                        have learned to welcome the oil in a liberal spirit; but by the lekin
                        system, which adds so many embarrassments to internal trade, the sale has
                        been diminished. The local authorities in the country around Shanghai levy a
                        tax of 5 cents on each case passing into the interior, a tax which until
                        recently has never been imposed. In spite of this temporary interruption,
                        Mr. Cheshire notes the gratifying fact that the trade during the past six
                        years shows a steady advance.</p>
                    <p>From Tien-Tsin, the most important city in Northern China, and in which might
                        be included Peking, we learn that in 1883 398,340 gallons were received.
                        This is a large gain over the import of 1882, namely, 284,130. In 1882
                        Tien-Tsin showed a falling trade, in 1883 a rising trade. Mr. Pilcher notes
                        a large import in native junks, the amount of which does not appear in the
                        customs returns. He estimates it, however, as in value about one fifth of
                        the whole. In Tien-Tsin the oil is mainly a re-exportation from Shanghai. I
                        think it would bean advantage to the petroleum interest if the oil could be
                        sent in bulk direct to Tien-Tsin; it would save the cost of transhipment in
                        Shanghai, and enable the people to buy at a cheaper rate. I note also that
                        the retail trade is largely in the hands of the Chinese shopkeepers. This I
                        regard as an advantage. Mr. Pilcher points out the fact that while the
                        native candles, made from mutton and beef tallow, can only be manufactured
                        at a cost of 15 cents per catty, kerosene is sold at 6 cents per <pb n="85"
                            xml:id="pg_85" facs="0185"/>catty. There is an economy in this fact
                        which cannot fail to make a deep impression upon the thrifty Chinese
                        mind.</p>
                    <p>From New Chwang, a small northern port, the legation learns that although
                        Shanghai reports a decrease in the shipment, there has really been an
                        increase in the trade of 1,715 gallons. This is a modest advance, but the
                        Department will see that it arises from commercial apathy, and not because
                        of the opposition of the authorities or any indisposition on the part of the
                        people to use the oil. This is seen in the fact that while during last
                        summer oil could be purchased at $2 a case, there is none now in stock, and
                        the last retail price was $5.50 a case.</p>
                    <p>I regret to note that in Ningpo there has been a falling off of 188,470
                        gallons as compared with the return for 1882, which showed an import of
                        1,505,470 gallons, an increase of 49,279 gallons over the preceding year.
                        When I wrote you in regard to petroleum in my dispatch No. 133, dated
                        February 20, 1883, I alluded to the evil effect, upon the trade of the
                        antagonism of the authorities at Ningpo. As this antagonism, or at least any
                        apparent evidence of it in the way of unfriendly proclamations or
                        governmental intervention, had passed away, I was in hopes to hear of a
                        large increase in the importations for 1883. Mr. Stevens does not explain
                        this disproportion except upon the theory of commercial fluctuations. * *
                        *</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bergholtz, the vice consul at Chin-Kiang, sends a lucid report as to the
                        trade. I attach much importance to the condition of the business at these
                        interior river ports, as thus we can measure its movement towards the
                        central divisions of the Empire. Petroleum must depend for its stability and
                        growth upon its general acceptance by the great mass of the people.
                        Therefore much more is to be learned from the statistics of a small river
                        port like Chin-Kiang than from a commercial emporium like Shanghai. Mr.
                        Bergholtz points to the interesting fact that while in 1868 the import was
                        only 90 gallons, in 1883 it was 389,090 gallons. And in looking over the
                        valuable table of figures in which he shows the movement of the trade, you
                        will see that the growth has been steady, the increase in 1883 over 1882
                        being no less than 131,090 gallons. Mr. Bergholtz reports the existence of
                        wells yielding a bituminous product, an “oil that burns in water,” and which
                        comes from the salt-wells in such a quantity that sometimes as many as four
                        or five jars of a hundred pounds each are collected in a day. This, to be
                        sure, is a modest output, but it suggests the possibility that China in time
                        will mine her own petroleum.</p>
                    <p>The importance 1 attribute to Chin-Kiang as a port showing the movement of
                        petroleum towards the interior of China, and its gradual acceptance as
                        essential to daily comfort by the people, will also apply to Hankow. Mr.
                        Shepard’s report is therefore entitled to careful study. When we look at the
                        figures the advance is most gratifying—in 1882,483,974 gallons; in 1883,
                        1,322,771, an increase of 173 per cent. A part of this Mr. Shepard
                        attributes to the decrease in the supply of native oil, the crop of which
                        was last year a failure. But while a better harvest of the vegetable native
                        oils may limit our hopes for a continued advance, I hold it to be a
                        controlling fact in the development of the trade in China that when once
                        petroleum finds a place, becomes known to the people, and they appreciate
                        its advantages and its economy, no native product will supplant it. Mr.
                        Shepard makes the wise suggestion that “an illustrated popular treatise in
                        Chinese would be of infinite service in making the nature, uses, and proper
                        care of the article known, thus extending the demand.”</p>
                    <p>Foo Chow has been unfortunate in its relations to the trade, and I <pb n="86"
                            xml:id="pg_86" facs="0186"/>regret to learn from the report of Mr.
                        Wingate that there has been a falling off in the import of 44,050 gallons in
                        1883, as compared with 1882. Even with this the importation was larger in
                        1883 than in any year, with the exception of 1882, since petroleum was
                        introduced into China. The causes for this deficit are more to be regretted
                        than the fact itself, for they show a determined opposition to the use of
                        the oil on the part of the authorities. He reports the virtual subsidence of
                        the panic of 1882, and that the proclamations against petroleum had become a
                        dead letter. As a result of this he looked for a still further increase of
                        the trade.</p>
                    <p>It unfortunately happened during the summer and fall of 1883 that there were
                        several fires in Foo-Chow to be attributed to petroleum. The most disastrous
                        was caused “by a man filling a kerosene lamp while it was burning. The oil
                        ignited, the man, alarmed, threw the lamp into the open kerosene can, and
                        the loss of a hundred houses and six lives followed.” This and other fires
                        less disastrous excited the “gentry” and the “literati,” and proclamations
                        were reissued, not to become a dead letter, as those of 1882, but to be
                        enforced. So strong is this feeling that although in Foo-Chow, as in all
                        other parts of China where petroleum has made its way, the people like the
                        oil for its cheapness and brilliancy, and the shopkeepers because it is a
                        steady source of business profit, the mandates of the authorities have been
                        obeyed, as is seen in the falling off of the import and the sudden arrest of
                        a flourishing trade. Mr. Wingate reports a fall from 160,000 gallons in
                        April, May, and June to 2,800 gallons in October, November, and
                        December—practically a destruction of the trade.</p>
                    <p>These facts have caused me much anxiety. * * * The tone of the proclamations
                        which Mr. Wingate forwards shows that the panic, like other panics, was
                        violent and widespread. “Kerosene means ruin!” “Kerosene is a fierce
                        calamity!” “The benefit does not make good the harm!” “For those who offend
                        there will be no pardon!”</p>
                    <p>The difficulties of the situation were not to be regarded without sympathy.
                        There had been many fires; property had been destroyed, lives had been lost.
                        Nor was a disaster of this kind and from a similar cause a new incident in
                        Foo-Chow. The magnitude of the present calamity could not be underrated.
                        Those who understand the customs of China can see How such a danger is
                        possible. A dense population; small houses, fragile, easily burned; narrow
                        streets; society without the knowledge or the organization to arrest a
                        fire—in such a community a fire means far more than it does in our cities of
                        brick and stone. We know from sad experience what fire can do with brick and
                        stone.</p>
                    <p>I saw no reason for making representations to the yamên against these
                        proclamations. They really belong to what might be called the commune system
                        of China. As I discovered when the legation acted upon the representations
                        of Mr. Consul-General Denny in 1882, there was no national policy of
                        antagonism. * * * This view was strengthened by the remembrance that at
                        Ningpo, Shanghai, and other points where there had been opposition it was
                        silenced, that the trade showed a steady increase, and that it would be
                        better to deal with Foo-Chow as an isolated case, and not accept counsels
                        which found inspiration in a panic as in any way expressing the policy of
                        the cabinet.</p>
                    <p>I requested Mr. Wingate to dwell upon certain points, and in dealing with the
                        abstract question of petroleum to show that it was not as dangerous as
                        gunpowder, which is one of the common elements in Chinese industry; and as
                        the Chinese had learned to handle gunpowder with impunity, in time they
                        would learn to do the same with petroleum. I <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87"
                            facs="0187"/>thought, on the other hand, that our merchants who deal in
                        this oil should take pains to furnish as safe a grade as possible. I quite
                        understand that an absolutely safe oil would be as useless as water, and
                        that the quality of lire which generates light and heat, and which is the
                        essential quality in a burning oil, is naturally an element of danger. No
                        oil should be sent here that is not of as high grade as that sent to India
                        and Japan. The merchants should take pains to develop their trade on broad
                        and humane lines; and nothing would do more towards that than to adopt the
                        suggestion contained in the dispatch of Mr. Shepard.</p>
                    <p>The petroleum interests at home have been well served by Mr. W. H. Lib by, an
                        American gentleman who came to Asia to represent the petroleum interest. Mr.
                        Libby entered upon his work with intelligent enthusiasm, and in the many
                        conversations and communications with which he has honored me seems to
                        possess the true idea of pressing this most important interest in China. I
                        attach much value to the work which that gentleman has done in China, and
                        therefore deem it worthy of special commendation to the Department.</p>
                    <p>While an event like this at Foo-Chow has a disheartening effect, it is to be
                        considered as among the incidents that attend the introduction of a new
                        article to a conservative community. In a country where the people for ages
                        have used vegetable and fish oils, whose artificial light forms a minor part
                        in the domestic economy of the household—a people so little affected by
                        change that you find among the coins of commerce pieces which were stamped
                        before the Christian era, you must expect distrust when you propose any
                        innovation, however slight. Such a thing is not altogether unknown in more
                        civilized communities. I am convinced that in dealing with circumstances
                        like those at Foo-Chow we must use patience and do what we can to persuade
                        and instruct the people. The yamên would regard any application with
                        indifference. It might arouse a different sentiment and lead to a general
                        policy throughout the Empire that might add further obstacles to the
                        trade.</p>
                    <p>In Canton there is a different state of affairs. The viceroy of the two
                        provinces has farmed out the sale of petroleum to a Chinese firm or
                        monopoly, and in order to strengthen the monopoly a special tax of 40 cents
                        is imposed on each case. The imposition of this tax I hold to be a direct
                        violation of treaty. As explained in my dispatch No. 297, dated November 30,
                        1883, I brought the subject to the attention of the foreign office in a note
                        of that date addressed to his imperial highness Prince Kung. As an
                        illustration of the delays attending the transaction of official business
                        with the Chinese, although nearly four months have passed no reply has been
                        received. I have made requests informally for an answer from the foreign
                        office, but without avail. Ten days ago I sent Mr. Holcombe to the yamên to
                        intimate that in my judgment the legation had waited long enough, and that
                        it was time to have some expression of opinion from his imperial highness. I
                        was informed that renewed orders had been sent to the viceroy at Canton to
                        make a report, but that until that report was made the Government could not
                        act. The close of navigation would naturally make communication tedious.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Seymour explains that he has not had a “favorable opportunity to resent
                        the kerosene claim advantageously, on account of military operations, mobs,
                        outrages, &amp;c.” While I recognized the burdens which had been thrown upon
                        the Canton viceroy on account of the exceptional condition of affairs in the
                        south, still it seemed that our patience had stood a sufficient test. I
                        have, therefore, as you will note, requested Mr. Seymour to press the matter
                        upon the attention of the viceroy.</p>
                    <p>I am not sanguine that these representations will be successful either <pb
                            n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0188"/>with the yamên or the viceroy unless
                        the Governments interested are firm. The tendency of the central Government
                        to permit the provincial authorities to manage financial affairs, taxation,
                        raising of loans, and disbursements of money, so as not to embarrass the
                        imperial treasury, makes it difficult to have a considerate hearing for any
                        question of this kind. The answer will always come that the money is
                        necessary for the government of the province. When the legation received the
                        Ward claims, the money did not come from the Government, but from the war
                        appropriations of Li. The Canton viceroy will pay the indemnity from local
                        sources, loans in Hong-Kong perhaps, guaranteed by taxes on salt or some
                        special monopoly. But while these are considerations which belong to the
                        Government of China, and do not especially concern us, * * * in the case of
                        the tax on the importation of petroleum our rights are clear and undoubted.
                        As I went into this question at length in my dispatch No. 297 and in my note
                        to Prince Kung, I shall not detain you by a repetition of the arguments
                        therein set forth.</p>
                    <p>In my dispatch No. 297 I referred to the proposal of the Chinese authorities
                        to adopt a series of rules for the government of the trade throughout the
                        Empire. Sir Robert Hart informed me in conversation that the new rules would
                        not go into operation until 1885, and that he had written to America for the
                        fullest information, so that when the rules were made they would serve the
                        best interests of the revenue and trade.</p>

                            received no report from Mr. Goldsborough, our consul at Amoy. The
                            report, which is hereby forwarded, was made with due promptitude, and
                            was overlooked by me in preparing my inclosures.</p>
                        <p>The Department will note that there has been a marked increase in the
                            import at Amoy, and that the trade since 1880 shows a slow but steady
                            advance. It is a further gratification to know that, as reported by Mr.
                            Goldsborough in January, 1883, there has been no attempt on the part of
                            the authorities to interfere with the petroleum trade.</p>

                    <p>From reports which have been furnished in response to this suggestion it will
                        be found that there is a warlike spirit in various provinces.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stevens says that in Ningpo there is “a continuous preparation for war by
                        those in authority.” New forts have been built and old ones repaired. Mr.
                        Stevens believes that the harbor of Ningpo will be a naval rendezvous for
                        China in the event of a war. I note also that preparations to impede
                        navigation at Ningpo are in embryo. Mr. Stevens estimates the number of
                        soldiers as 16,000, but should necessity arise there might be 30,000. It is
                        pleasant to note that the temper of the people towards foreigners is
                        friendly and cordial.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bergholtz informs the legation that all is quiet at Chin Kiang.</p>
                    <p>From New Chwang I learn in the report of Mr. Bandinel that there are
                        important military movements.</p>
                    <p>At Port Arthur there are 6,000 troops, under a Mohammedan leader, well
                        disciplined, strong, and tree from opium smoking. Instructions have been
                        sent to the Tartar general to raise 2,000 more, but the experiment seems to
                        languish from the want of funds. There is no sentiment of ill will against
                        foreigners.</p>
                    <p>Tien-Tsin, as the gateway to Peking; the most important commercial city in
                        the north and the home of the viceroy Li, is worthy of special notice.</p>
                    <p>Tien-Tsin is the headquarters of serious military preparations, the functions
                        of Li at this time being practically those of a lieutenant-general of the
                        Empire. There are eight fortified camps, where are quartered 4,800 troops,
                        one-half cavalry, the remainder infantry; an additional force of 3,000 is
                        being raised. The enlistment system really amounts to a conscription, or it
                        might be a levy <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi>, something akin to the press
                        gang which was in vogue in England during the last century. The term of
                        service is not specified. The infantry soldiers receive $3.60 a month, the
                        cavalryman $7.20, out of which he must provide for his horse. The soldiers
                        furnish their food and clothing. They are armed with foreign guns and
                        drilled according to western, I presume German, tactics.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wingate does not note at Foo-Chow any special military movements except
                        the multiplication of barriers in the city. He is not sure whether this is
                        meant to guard against foreigners or prevent thieving. There is a small
                        military force at Foo-Chow, 300 perhaps, each soldier paid 1,000 cash, or
                        $1, per month. A thousand troops have been brought from one point and 3,000
                        are expected from another. The same complaint comes from Foo-Chow that we
                        hear elsewhere, namely, the want of money. It was proposed by the viceroy to
                        raise a million taels, or, say, $1,400,000, as a “patriotic contribution”—in
                        other words, an enforced loan. It appears, however, that the people who had
                        the money proposed that the officials should first raise the amount, and
                        they would then say what they would do. It was also suggested to levy a tax
                        upon rice, but this the people would never admit. With salt taxed to its
                        utmost value, taxed so heavily as to make it a luxury, the objection of the
                        people to a tax upon rice is not a surprise. Mr. Wingate reports that the
                        feeling of the people towards foreigners is what might be called courteous
                        apathy, and as to war with France, ignorance and indifference.</p>
                    <p>Hankow is reported as peaceful.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Goldsborough sends an interesting dispatch from Amoy. The relations
                        between foreigners and Chinese are satisfactory. He notes, however, in the
                        form of a proclamation from the subprefect at Amoy, threats against the
                        dynasty on the part of some pretender to the throne. <pb n="90"
                            xml:id="pg_90" facs="0190"/>The tone of the proclamation may indicate to
                        the Department a spirit of unnecessary alarm. But when we remember the
                        trifling causes which germinated in the Tai-ping rebellion, keeping China in
                        sedition and turmoil for years, causing the devastation of provinces and the
                        loss of millions of lives, the effect of which is still felt, it is easy to
                        understand the anxiety of the Government at the appearance of the slightest
                        pretension to overthrow the dynasty. Rumors as to adventures of the same
                        character came from Hankow last summer, and I have had occasion to note them
                        in Peking.</p>
                    <p>I have dwelt upon Canton affairs so fully in former dispatches that I need do
                        no more than refer to the dispatch of Mr. Seymour.</p>
                    <p>But exceptional circumstances exist in Canton. The people have the aggressive
                        and restless spirit which we are so apt to find in southern
                        latitudes—haughty, impetuous, brave. Although the Cantonese, because of
                        their long intercourse with foreigners, going back to the early days of the
                        East India Company, and because of the many thousands who, having lived in
                        the United States and the colonies of Great Britain, are now at home again,
                        and their consequent familiarity with western ways, would be supposed to
                        have a kindly feeling towards foreigners, the reverse is the truth.</p>
                    <p>There is more trouble in Canton and we have more anxiety as to the public
                        peace in the Cantonese provinces than in any part of China. Other provinces
                        are torpid, and seeing little of the foreigner care less about him. Their
                        feeling is that of contempt and curiosity, not enmity. Canton is near to the
                        seat of war in Tonquin, and suffers from this proximity.</p>
                    <p>While, therefore, we must accept the fact that China is in a seething,
                        troubled condition, I cannot note any phenomena that would justify alarm as
                        to the safety of foreigners. And although I have been asked by American
                        citizens in the interior whether it was prudent for them to leave their work
                        and come to the sea-ports, where they would have the protection of our
                        ships, I have seen no reason to give such advice. In conversation with my
                        colleagues I have heard no feeling of apprehension.</p>
                    <p>While one part of the Empire may be peaceful, there may be turmoil in
                        another. Nor are the people homogeneous; thus, a northern Chinaman may
                        dislike a foreigner, but he hates a Cantonese.</p>
                    <p>There are deep, wide fissures in China. The dialects are so peculiar that
                        natives of one province cannot understand the inhabitants of another. The
                        Divine interdict which led to the confusion of tongues has fallen upon
                        China, and a Cantonese in the eyes of a Pekingese is as much an alien as an
                        Algerine or a Turk. Out of this comes an absence of national public spirit,
                        the sentiment which during our own war was known as “loyalty.”</p>
                    <p>These local animosities, arising out of the want of intercourse and free
                        communication between the provinces, may be regarded as the principal reason
                        why a great and densely populated Empire should be so easily governed by an
                        alien race, vastly inferior in numbers.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to confirm my cable dispatch
                        dated February 11, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Holcombe returned, having satisfactorily settled Chinaufoo case.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>In my dispatch No. 285, dated November 14, I informed the Department that I
                        had resolved to send Mr. Holcombe to Chinaufoo to endeavor to arrange
                        long-standing grievances between the American missionaries residing there
                        and the Chinese authorities.</p>
                    <p>I did this with some reluctance, because I do not wish to encourage a
                        disposition on the part of the yamên to throw the responsibility of settling
                        important questions upon the provincial officials. At the same time, the
                        American citizens in Chinaufoo had been a long time deprived of their
                        rights. All recourse to the yamên had been exhausted, and I saw no better
                        way to secure a practical result than to deal directly with the governor of
                        the province.</p>
                    <p>This decision I am glad to know met with your approval.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Holcombe left Peking on the morning of December 25, 1883, and returned
                        February 9, 1884. I wrote the viceroy Li Hung Chang regarding his mission,
                        expressing the hope that all courtesy would be shown him as the
                        representative of this legation.</p>
                    <p>In my dispatch No. 333, dated January 26, I had the pleasure of saying to the
                        Department that every pains had been taken by the authorities to meet my
                        wishes in this respect and to do honor to Mr. Holcombe. In his report Mr.
                        Holcombe dwells with more detail upon this gratifying incident. I make a
                        special reference to this because, at a time when there is much anxiety in
                        China as to the status of foreigners, it is a gratification to know that a
                        friendly disposition exists towards Americans.</p>
                    <p>The details of Mr. Holcombe’s settlement will appear in the inclosures.</p>
                    <p>The agreement as it now stands is satisfactory to the gentlemen directly
                        concerned and meets with my approval. I trust that it will satisfy the
                        Department.</p>
                    <p>In the mean time I commend to your recognition the judgment and tact shown by
                        Mr. Holcombe in carrying out the orders of the legation and bringing to an
                        honorable result a question which has been for a long time a source of
                        anxiety.</p>
                    <p>I have informed his imperial highness Prince Kung that the legation regards
                        the “Chinaufoo case” as satisfactorily disposed of, and requested him to
                        thank the governor of Shantung for his most courteous treatment of Mr.
                        Holcombe.</p>

                            January 12.</p>
                        <p>The three following days were necessarily occupied with the interchange
                            of preliminary visits of courtesy, and my first business interview with
                            his excellency the governor took place, by appointment, Wednesday,
                            January 16, after which I had interviews, with him each day for an
                            entire week. In all these discussions his excellency manifested a most
                            friendly spirit and an exceeding anxiety to dispose of the business in
                            hand to my satisfaction. * * * We discussed the whole business in hand
                            from its origin in the mob of July 12, 1881, down to the present, with
                            the utmost candor and thoroughness and yet with mutual good nature. Upon
                            my part I assured his excellency, at our first interview, that my
                            mission to Chinaufoo had but one object, which was to dispose of the
                            case in question in a spirit of the utmost conciliation and forbearance
                            that my desire was not to obstruct but to facilitate a settlement, and
                            that I should demand nothing unreasonable or beyond his powers to grant.
                            He was also plainly assured that I should not ask the restitution to the
                            missionaries of the property originally purchased by them, as I did not
                            believe that such a demand, even if willingly complied with, would, in
                            view of popular feeling, really conserve the interests at stake. His
                            excellency appeared greatly relieved by this assurance. But it was also
                            added that, this concession being made on our part freely to the
                            sentiments of the Chinese, we ought to expect, and would indeed insist,”
                            that our demands in all other particulars should be fully and promptly
                            met, and we thus be shown that our forbearance in waiving our rights to
                            the original premises was appreciated:</p>
                        <p>His excellency replied that his greatest anxiety had been lest I should
                            insist upon the rendition of the original property, which could not have
                            been acceded to by him except at the risk of another popular uprising.
                            Since, however, I had spoken in so conciliatory a manner upon that
                            point, he had no hesitation in assuring me that all other demands would
                            be met without hesitation or reserve.</p>
                        <p>His excellency had secured two different premises, of which he offered
                            the choice as in exchange for the original purchase, and after the
                            interview of January 17 I made a careful inspection of each in person.
                            The missionaries also examined them at my request.</p>
                        <p>As a result of our conferences I submitted to his excellency, at our
                            interview of January 18, a memorandum in which I proposed, under certain
                            conditions, to accept, on behalf of the missionaries, one of the
                            premises offered.</p>
                        <p>To this his excellency submitted a counter-memorandum on the 19th.</p>
                        <p>An examination of this rejoinder will show you at once that the governor
                            substantially accepted all my conditions with one exception. He insisted
                            that the missionaries should pay the legal tax on the deed for the new
                            premises, as they should have done (but had not) upon the premises first
                            bought.</p>
                        <p>As the amount involved was only some 110 (Mexican) dollars, I yielded
                            this point without a question.</p>
                        <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0193"/>
                        <p>In order to bring the business into a formal shape, response was made to
                            the governor’s counter-memorandum in the shape of an official dispatch,
                            copy of which you will find herewith. In it the points of agreement were
                            summarized, and his excellency was requested to state whether he
                            accepted them, and, if so to name an early day for the exchange of the
                            necessary papers.</p>
                        <p>His response was made on the 20th January. He accepted the terms <hi
                                rend="italic">in toto</hi> and named the 22d as the day for
                            concluding the business.</p>
                        <p>Upon that date I received from the governor an official title-deed, made
                            out in the names of the missionaries, for the new premises, together
                            with a bank order for 3,000 taels, the amount agreed upon to be paid as
                            the difference in the value of the two properties, and I delivered to
                            his excellency the title-deed of the premises first purchased and 83.10
                            taels, the amount of tax on the transfer of the property. Immediately
                            after this interview the district magistrate went in person and formally
                            delivered the new premises to Messrs. Murray and Hunter, who, at my
                            request, were in waiting to take possession of them. The interchange,
                            upon the same day, of formal notes between his excellency the governor
                            and myself brought this case to a conclusion.</p>
                        <p>Upon my part Messrs. Murray and Hunter were also formally addressed in a
                            note, reciting the points of my agreement with the Chinese authorities,
                            and inclosing the title-deeds to the new property and the bank note for
                            3,000 taels.</p>
                        <p>I may add further that these gentlemen were consulted fully and frankly,
                            and they assented to the wisdom of the various conclusions reached by
                            me.</p>
                        <p>Having thus accomplished the object of my mission, I exchanged
                            leave-taking calls with his excellency the governor upon the 23d January
                            and set out upon my return to this city the following day.</p>
                        <p>There are one or two points embodied in this report upon which a word of
                            explanation may perhaps be necessary.</p>
                        <p>The question of the cemetery lot does not appear in the earlier
                            correspondence in this ease. It has, in fact, never been formally
                            brought to the notice of this legation.</p>
                        <p>It had, however, caused our citizens at Chinaufoo much trouble and
                            anxiety, and, at their request, it was brought forward in my
                            negotiations with the governor.</p>
                        <p>The sum of 3,000 taels paid by the Chinese authorities was, in my
                            opinion, a larger amount than this legation could with reason have
                            insisted on as representing an actual difference between the value of
                            the premises originally purchased and those accepted in exchange.
                            Indeed, after personal inspection of both properties, I had fixed upon
                            the sum of 2,000 taels as the proper equivalent. But Messrs. Murray and
                            Hunter urged, with some show of reason, a difference in the value of the
                            two locations, and also the fact that they might with justice claim some
                            considerable sum in compensation for the delay of two and a half years
                            during which they had been deprived of the use of the premises
                            bought.</p>
                        <p>Moved by these considerations, I inserted in my first memoranda a claim
                            for 3,000 taels, but was prepared to yield somewhat upon it in case the
                            Chinese authorities raised serious objections. But to my gratification
                            his excellency the governor accepted the sum named at once, saying in
                            personal conversation, “I know there is no such difference in the values
                            of the two properties, but you have come a long distance to settle this
                            business and shown yourself very reasonable and friendly; and, further,
                            I have a great regard for the Protestant missionaries; I know that they
                            are doing a good work, and I am quite willing to give them a few hundred
                            taels more than strict justice would demand.”</p>
                        <p>Since his excellency, therefore, yielded this point so promptly and
                            gracefully, I saw no reason for modifying the demands as made at the
                            request of the missionaries.</p>
                        <p>I should do injustice as well to my own feelings as to the authorities of
                            the provinces of Chihli and Shantung did I close this report without
                            calling special attention to the very marked and unusual courtesies
                            extended to me along the route of my journey by the local authorities
                            and in the city of Chinaufoo by the governor. As I was on the point of
                            leaving Tien-Tsin his excellency Li Hung Chang sent a secretary to say
                            to me that he had informed the governor of Shantung of my movements, and
                            had also instructed his subordinates on so much of my route as lay
                            within the province of Chihli to show me all possible attention. The
                            effects of this act of thoughtful courtesy were at once apparent. The
                            local officials secured in advance for me the best inns at each point
                            where I stopped, whether for the night or for the mid-day meal, fitted
                            them up with rugs, carpets, cushions, and curtains, sent cooks and
                            servants to see that my food was ready for me, and in many instances the
                            chief magistrate of the district, equivalent to the mayor of one of our
                            cities, came in person to meet me, to pay his respects and to make sure
                            by his presence that his arrangements for my comfort were properly
                            executed. A military escort of never less than twenty persons and more
                            frequently numbering fifty or sixty, equally divided between cavalry and
                            infantry, accompanied me from point to point, being exchanged at each
                            district city from Tien-Tsin to Chinaufoo. A similar escort was
                            furnished upon, my return. At a <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0194"
                            />distance of some five miles from Chinaufoo I was met by an aid to the
                            governor, sent to bring me the compliments of his excellency and to say
                            that he had sent his own sedan chair out for me, and he begged me to
                            make use of it in entering the city, as it was more comfortable than the
                            “mule-litter” in which I was traveling. At the point where the
                            governor’s sedan chair was waiting for me two regiments of soldiers were
                            paraded and salutes were fired in my honor. An immense concourse of
                            people had assembled here, as it had been known throughout the city for
                            several days that I was coming and the populace seemed to have taken a
                            holiday in order to see the “foreign official.” Chinese said that 20,000
                            people were gathered, but probably 10,000 would be nearer the mark. They
                            were very curious, but perfectly quiet and respectful.</p>
                        <p>On reaching the city I found that the governor had taken an entire inn
                            for my accommodation, fitted it up thoroughly in accordance with Chinese
                            ideas of comfort, and had sent his own cook and major domo, with a great
                            retinue of attendants of various grades, some thirty persons in all, to
                            wait upon me. These servants remained in attendance during the entire
                            period of my stay in Chinaufoo, and my meals were furnished me
                            constantly from the governor’s kitchen.</p>
                        <p>I need hardly say that I would much have preferred to make my journey in
                            a more quiet and unpretentious style, and as I had a sufficient number
                            of my own servants in company for all my wants, that such a retinue was
                            more or less of an embarrassment. I endeavored, so far as could be with
                            safety to my mission, to avoid so large an escort <hi rend="italic">en
                                route</hi> to Chinaufoo, but it was quite useless to ask the local
                            authorities to excuse me from accepting it. They had their orders from
                            the governor and knew well that not even my request and protestation
                            against so much display would serve to shield them from any failure to
                            obey his mandate. In a similar manner I endeavored at Chinaufoo to
                            induce the governor to withdraw his large retinue of servants from my
                            inn and to allow my own attendants to wait upon me. But his excellency,
                            an exceedingly amiable and courteous old gentleman, was evidently
                            influenced by two motives,” one to show me how magnificently courteous a
                            Chinese official could be when he cared to make the effort, and, second,
                            and probably the more important motive, to show his own people in a
                            quiet but most effective manner the regard and honor in which he and his
                            Government held the officials of the United States. Hence he had caused
                            me to be treated in all respects as though I were an imperial
                            commissioner of His Majesty the Emperor of China. And hence I found that
                            to press my protestations and excuses beyond a certain point would wound
                            the kindly feelings of the governor and endanger the success of my
                            mission, by arousing in his mind the suspicion that I either did not
                            know how to appreciate such courtesies or that I objected to the receipt
                            of favors at his hand because I was in an aggressive mood. It seemed
                            best, therefore, to accept these attentions quietly and in the spirit
                            they were offered.</p>
                        <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I have dwelt at length upon this phase of my mission to Chinaufoo because
                            it had an important bearing upon the results of that mission, and
                            because, so far as can be learned, it is entirely without precedent, no
                            foreign official traveling, whether on business or pleasure, in the
                            interior of China, having received such excessive courtesy before. And
                            it is safe to assume, as among the most important of its valuable
                            results, that it will effect a radical change in the minds of the people
                            of an entire province as to the feelings of the Chinese Government
                            towards foreign officials.</p>
                        <p>Heretofore those people have believed, with or without reason, that in
                            his secret heart every Chinese official had a contempt for foreigners of
                            all classes. But now the populace of one province have been shown in a
                            practical and striking manner that an officer of the United States is
                            held by the highest authority of the province in equal honor with an
                            officer of His Majesty the Emperor. The effects of this lesson cannot
                            fail to be lasting and valuable.</p>
                        <p>Trusting that my action as herein recited will meet with your approval
                            and that of the Department of State,</p>
                        <p>I have, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that the
                            condition of affairs in Southern China is not altogether indicative of
                            tranquillity, although in the immediate vicinity of Canton everything
                            seems to be quiet. The two events which are of sufficient importance to
                            mention at the present time are the effects of the military operations
                            resulting in the capture of Bachninh by the French forces, and the
                            progress of the Chinese rebellion near Hwai Chow, in the eastern portion
                            of the province of Kwangtung, from both of which points full and
                            reliable information was this day received in Canton, although rumors
                            had reached here early in the week.</p>
                        <p>Bachninh was captured and occupied by the French forces on the evening of
                            Wednesday, 12th instant, without much of a conflict, the total losses of
                            both sides having been less than one hundred men, and about equally
                            divided.</p>
                        <p>From all accounts of a reliable nature it seems to have been an empty and
                            unexpectedly unimportant victory for the French, as the total population
                            at and about Bachninh, a week before its evacuation by the natives,
                            numbered over 25,000, all of whom have retired or retreated further into
                            the interior, the first stand being located at Thainquyen, with a more
                            remote and formidable point called Langson, toward which places the
                            French forces are understood to be slowly advancing.</p>
                        <p>The French flotilla, consisting of the Pluvier, Lynx, Léopard, Aspic,
                            Trombe, and and Caroline, and several launches and junks laden with
                            supplies, &amp;c., found the river barricaded at Langson by stone and
                            sunken junks.</p>
                        <p>As a distance of 80 miles has to be traversed between Bachninh and the
                            nearest of the two places to which the hostile forces are moving, it is
                            obvious that the French incur the danger and inconvenience of operating
                            very far from their base of operations; but as the natives have not yet
                            manifested any ability to offer any resistance to the French forces,
                            except to impede navigation, possibly the progress of the latter will be
                            undisputed.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time there is every reasonable prospect that the Chinese
                            frontier may be the scene of occurrences which will ultimately bring the
                            French and Chinese armies into conflict, which must result disastrously
                            to the Chinese, whose regiments, encumbered with banners, pikes, poles,
                            and spears, and with inferior arms, and destitute of discipline, so far
                            as I could discern during their passage through Canton, are impotent
                            against well-disciplined soldiers of Europe or America.</p>
                        <p>When Sentai was captured by the French, the natives of Canton were made
                            to believe that the French had been mercilessly slaughtered immediately
                            after occupying that place; and last week Canton was assured and happy
                            over the prevalent rumor that the French had been enticed and entrapped
                            into Bachninh, and soon after the natives completely slaughtered their
                            invaders. * * * *</p>
                        <p>When it was reported that Bachninh had teen captured there was no great
                            excitement in Canton, and the general remark was, “We do not care, if
                            the French keep away from Canton.”</p>
                        <p>The rebels at and about Hwai Chow, in the eastern part of the province of
                            Kwangtung, are being re-enforced, the number of active rebels now
                            numbering about 10,000 men.</p>
                        <p>As yet the Government troops have not attacked the chief position of the
                            rebels.</p>
                        <p>On Sunday, 16th instant, at Pak Mong Fu there was a conflict, resulting
                            in the loss of 200 men and wounding Tang On Pang, the mandarin in
                            command of the Government forces.</p>
                        <p>The Hakka portion of the soldiers brought from Canton dispersed. The
                            attack on the rebels was made by soldiers from Funam.</p>
                        <p>The Triad Society, which is supposed to be helping the rebels, is rapidly
                            increasing in numbers, as the people of Southern China are convinced
                            there will be serious trouble.</p>
                        <p>The information regarding the troubles in the region of Hwai Chow is
                            derived from a very trustworthy German missionary. Rev. E. R. Eichler,
                            of the London mission, who has passed the last month in the vicinity of
                            the disturbances, and who returned to Canton this afternoon, via
                            Hong-Kong.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your No. 350, of the 11th of February last,
                        concerning the threatened obstruction of the Canton River by the viceroy of
                        the province, as a defensive war measure, has been received and read with
                        much attention.</p>
                    <p>The report of your conference with the yamên on the 14th of January presents
                        very clearly the embarrassments which attend any attempt to make clear to
                        the Chinese Government the relations of the treaty powers to each other in
                        regard to this question.</p>
                    <p>In your interview with the yamên you closely anticipated the tenor of my
                        telegraphic instruction of the 22d of January. Had that telegram been before
                        you it might possibly have furnished you with a reply to an argument
                        frequently put forth by the ministers of the yamên, that the neutral powers
                        should show their friendship for China by preventing France from attacking
                        China without proper previous notice of intention to do so. This is, as you
                        will have seen, almost exactly the ground taken by the United States.</p>
                    <p>The real issue seems to have been very succinctly put by Chang-ta-jên in the
                        interview of the following day with Sir Harry Parkes. “If,” said he, “China
                        could be certain that France would be guided by the laws of war in her
                        future action, and an authoritative assurance could be obtained from any
                        quarter that France would not attack (the open ports) without due notice,
                        Chang-ta-jên would promise, on his own responsibility; that the obstructions
                        at Canton should be removed.”</p>
                    <p>The gravity of the question seems to have been removed in a great measure by
                        the assurance given by the yamên that a channel of over 100 feet in width
                        would be left in both channels for the convenience of steamers and sailing
                        vessels, an assurance which Chang-ta-jên seems afterwards to have still
                        further extended to 150 feet, as appears from the telegram from the British
                        consul at Canton to Sir Harry Parkes of January 26.</p>
                    <p>Even, however, under this favorable modification, the obstruction to the
                        channel at Canton and Whampoa can only be tolerated as a temporary measure,
                        to be removed as soon as the special occasion therefor shall have passed,
                        and under no circumstances to be admitted as a precedent for setting
                        obstacles to open navigation at the treaty ports in time of peace, under
                        pretext of being intended for ultimate strategic defense in the contingency
                        of future war.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to submit herewith, for the
                        consideration of the Department, a copy of a dispatch received from Mr.
                        Consul Shepard, at Hankow, and a copy of my response.</p>
                    <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0197"/>
                    <p>Mr. Shepard calls my attention to the refusal of Chinese officials in the
                        interior to recognize transit passes; to attempts made by them to levy lekin
                        and other taxes upon goods covered by transit passes; he points out the
                        injurious effect of such action upon our trade, and asks for the energetic
                        intervention of the legation.</p>
                    <p>The subject thus brought up, by no means for the first time in the history of
                        this legation, is one of grave importance, and, as Mr. Shepard has been
                        informed, will have serious attention.</p>
                    <p>But in my reply I have felt obliged to express a divergence of opinion upon
                        one point raised in Mr. Shepard’s dispatch, and it is to that point alone
                        that at the moment I beg to ask the attention of the Department.</p>
                    <p>With his dispatch were forwarded no less than thirty-four transit passes
                        issued to Mr. J. M. Burnett, an American citizen, and rejected by Chinese
                        officials in the interior. In reference to these Mr. Shepard remarks: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>I do no claim that Mr. Burnett actually owned the goods (covered by
                                these thirty-four passes,) <hi rend="italic">for he undoubtedly acts
                                    for native traders</hi>, as I have explained in a former
                                communication. But that should make no difference in the treatment
                                of passes inward, since no distinction is made between natives and
                                foreigners in the protection the certificates warrant.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>Upon this point I have replied to Mr. Shepard that, in my opinion, we cannot
                        ignore the fact, if such a fact is known, that American merchants are acting
                        for Chinese principals, and are not themselves the <hi rend="italic">bona
                            fide</hi> owners of the merchandise covered and protected by transit
                        passes taken out by them and I have pointed out that, in the constantly
                        recurring discussion of the transit-pass system between the Government of
                        China and foreign representatives, the former has always insisted and the
                        latter admitted that under the treaties transit certificates can only be
                        used legitimately by foreigners to cover and protect <hi rend="italic"
                            >foreign owned</hi> merchandise.</p>
                    <p>The entire transit-pass system is a creation of the treaties between China
                        and foreign powers. It was devised, not for the advantage of Chinese
                        merchants, but for the benefit of foreign exporters and importers, by the
                        substitution of a fixed internal tariff in place of the uncertainties and
                        irregularities of the Chinese interior and local systems of taxation. That
                        commerce would be largely benefited by the extension of the transit-pass
                        system to Chinese merchants is no doubt true, but that is a question between
                        the Government of China and its subjects, with which we cannot interfere. We
                        certainly ought not to allow our people to connive with subjects of this
                        Empire in seeking by surreptitious means to secure advantages to which they
                        are not legitimately entitled.</p>
                    <p>The responsibility for the failure of the transit-pass system to produce the
                        good results expected of it cannot, I fear, be laid wholly upon the Chinese.
                        It is, on the one hand, true that local Chinese officials ignore and
                        repudiate transit passes, and thus violate the express provisions of treaty;
                        but it is not less true, on the other hand, that at several of the ports are
                        foreigners, merchants so called, but with neither capital nor connection,
                        who lend or sell their names to native firms in the use of transit passes,
                        thereby enabling the latter to evade the laws of the Empire. Hankow, as a
                        port, has long been notorious for this form of abuse of the transit-pass
                        system, and by Mr. Shepard’s declaration it appears that Mr. Burnett has
                        been doing this sort of work for Chinese merchants.</p>
                    <p>The whole system sadly needs revision and readjustment, but it is too much to
                        expect that the Government of China will take efficient measures <pb n="98"
                            xml:id="pg_98" facs="0198"/>to put an end to the violations of the
                        treaties by its local officers in this direction until it has a practical
                        assurance that foreign powers will no longer permit abuses of the privilege
                        by their people.</p>
                    <p>In this view the question raised as to the right of American citizens to
                        allow themselves to be used as figure-heads or men of straw by Chinese
                        merchants, in taking out transit passes, becomes of very serious importance,
                        and upon it I beg to receive the instructions of the Department.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my No. 90 I referred to the
                            interference with transit passes inward by lekin officials at points
                            distant from Hankow, by which foreign goods were deprived of the
                            benefits intended to be secured by the passes, and were consequently
                            subjected to an unjust taxation <hi rend="italic">en route</hi>, thereby
                            largely increasing the cost of foreign products, to be borne by the
                            native consumer. The effect of such a course must be only prejudicial to
                            trade, acting directly to prevent and curtail commerce in articles from
                            foreign countries. Such is, moreover, an unquestionable violation of
                            treaty provisions, as conceded by the tsung-li yamên in their letter to
                            the Chinese ministers abroad, which unequivocally recognizes the fact
                            that such certificates “cover goods from a treaty port to a place named
                            in the certificate, exempting them from ail taxes <hi rend="italic">en
                                route</hi>.”</p>
                        <p>This matter, with other efforts to interfere with foreign trade inland,
                            has been formerly reported to the legation, its importance has been
                            recognized, and a willingness expressed to use all proper efforts to
                            secure a reform of abuses. But at the outset the purpose was weakened
                            and reformatory results prevented from the lack of positive proof of
                            native irregularities. No doubt has ever been expressed of the truth of
                            my allegations, but in the lack of collateral proof to sustain them
                            definite action on the part of the legation was scarcely possible, and I
                            was asked to watch for such proof. While perfectly assured of the facts,
                            I have never until now been able to secure such positive evidence as
                            cannot be denied by local officials and some subterfuge brought forward
                            to evade the conclusion of their undeniable hostility to the
                            introduction of foreign manufactures into the Empire. I now have
                            indubitable proof of a gross violation of the authority and force of
                            inland-transit passes, and, as in duty bound, transmit the facts and
                            evidence for the attention of your excellency.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to inclose to you no less than thirty-four passes,
                            pasted and attached together in one mass, and in this form returned to
                            J. N. Burnett, the American shipper of goods from this port. I do not
                            claim that Burnett actually owned the goods, for he undoubtedly acts for
                            native traders, as I have explained in a former communication. But that
                            should make no difference in the treatment of passes inward, since no
                            distinction is made between natives and foreigners in the protection the
                            certificates warrant.</p>
                        <p>Inspection of the returned passes will show that they were stopped and
                            taken up at Yochow, a tax-barrier near the mouth of the Tung Ting Lake.
                            The officials there detain boats with foreign goods for an indefinite
                            period, until a number of passes for the same destination are collected,
                            and from that point onward to the end of the transit the goods are
                            forwarded unaccompanied, and of course unprotected, by the passes that
                            should be with each separate lot of merchandise. They are, therefore,
                            exposed to lekin taxation at every subsequent barrier passed. I have
                            made investigation of the contingent circumstances, to discover them as
                            accurately as possible, and find the following to be the facts: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The goods sent by the route in question are mostly, if not
                                    entirely, piece-goods of American and British
                                    manufacture.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>There are several long routes beyond the Tung Ting Lake over
                                    which transit goods are conveyed, some of them being land
                                    routes. One leads southwest to Kweichow, and the other to the
                                    southern part of Lzechuen. During the summer months, when the
                                    Yangtsze is in flood, the latter is closed for a time. My
                                    information is that on both routes there are several
                                    tax-barriers that the goods must pass, and as the transit
                                    certificates are separated from the goods at Yochow, it follows
                                    that they are unprotected for the entire distance beyond, and
                                    lekin taxes are most undoubtedly collected at every barrier, in
                                    accordance with Chinese custom in similar cases.</item>
                                <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0199"/>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The amount of such taxation I have been unable to learn, as it
                                    is of course kept concealed by the officials interested; but
                                    traders here admit that it exceeds the half duty originally paid
                                    for the transit pass to clear the goods.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The effect upon trade inland will be obvious, and it requires no argument
                            to induce your excellency to take up a matter so important to American
                            interests, and I leave it in your hands, confident of wise action.</p>
                        <p>In regard to tea passes, I may add, for your information, that, on the
                            request of both Mr. Burnett and Mr. Jenkins, I have recently applied for
                            the issue of them.</p>
                        <p>The answer of the taotai to the applications in both cases is that when
                            the missing passes for previous years are returned those now asked for
                            will be issued.</p>
                        <p>The inference is that none will be issued to the applicants till then,
                            and as their return is impossible, the decision is in effect a refusal
                            to issue at all.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have had the honor to receive your
                            dispatch No. 95. The subject to which it refers will have careful
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>I may say, however, that I do not share your opinion that we can ignore
                            the fact, if such a fact is known, that American merchants are acting
                            for Chinese principals and are not themselves the <hi rend="italic">bona
                                fide</hi> owners of the merchandise covered and protected by transit
                            passes.</p>
                        <p>While it is true, as you say, that the tsung-li yamên, in its circular to
                            Chinese ministers abroad, did recognize the fact that transit
                            certificates “cover goods from a treaty port to a place named in the.
                            certificate, exempting them from all taxes <hi rend="italic">en
                                route</hi>,” it is also true that the circular referred to maintains
                            with equal plainness that under the treaties such certificates can only
                            be used legitimately by foreigners to cover and protect <hi
                                rend="italic">foreign-owned</hi> merchandise.</p>
                        <p>This interpretation of the treaties has always been stoutly maintained by
                            China, and, so far as I am-aware, has never been disputed by any foreign
                            Government. A notable case may be found in the files of your own office,
                            being that in which Mr. A. Jenkins claimed damages against the Chinese
                            Government for the detention of goods under transit pass in 1874–‘75,
                            and in which this legation declined to press his claim for damages,
                            because the burden of evidence went to show that he was not the owner of
                            the goods in question, but was acting for Chinese principals.</p>
                        <p>I shall have occasion to address you further upon this important question
                            at an early moment.</p>

                        stating that twenty-four Chinese merchants, with proper certificates under
                        the law of May 6, 1882, had lately arrived at San Francisco, and had been
                        refused permission to land because of a non-compliance with the law of July
                        5, 1884, a copy of which is herewith inclosed.</p>
                    <p>As these Chinese were at sea when the act was passed, and as the ship on

                        immediately brought the matter to the attention of the Secretary of <pb

                        the law seemed to be erroneous, and, under the circumstances of this
                        particular case (as it was manifestly impossible for the Chinese merchants
                        to comply with a law which was not in existence when they departed for the
                        United States), unnecessarily severe. I therefore requested him to telegraph
                        instructions to the collector of San Francisco permitting them to land.</p>
                    <p>I have received a letter from the Acting Secretary of the Treasury, dated the
                        31st of July ultimo, in which he states that the following telegram has been
                        sent to the said collector, viz: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Allow twenty-four Chinese merchants who arrived at your port on 28th
                                instant to land, without exacting evidence required by act of July
                                5, 1884.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>I have had pleasure in acquainting, by a note of the 2d instant, the Chinese
                        chargé d’affaires <hi rend="italic">ad interim</hi> of this decision of the
                        Acting Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion I may observe that consideration is now being given to the law
                        of July 5, 1884, which prohibits the landing of Chinese laborers at any port
                        or place in the United States except as provided in section 4. The act also
                        changes somewhat the form of certificate under which this privileged class
                        of His Majesty’s subjects may go from and come to the United States. As
                        soon, therefore, as the matter is finally determined, you will be given
                        copies of the correspondence, for your information.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatch No. 462, of June 18 last, has
                        been received and read with attention. It presents the transit-pass question
                        and asks whether American citizens can legitimately act for Chinese
                        principals in the use of such passes.</p>
                    <p>The circumstances reported in your dispatch represent a condition of affairs
                        not altogether agreeable to contemplate, and, in accordance with your
                        desire, I may observe that United States citizens who lend or sell their
                        names to native firms in China, to enable such firms to violate the laws of
                        that Empire by the use of transit passes, are not entitled to the protection
                        of this Government in any case arising for the violation of the treaty by
                        the Chinese local authorities, for refusing to recognize such passes, when
                        the goods which they are reported to cover do not actually belong to our
                        citizens. American citizens who are legitimately engaged in trade, and
                        entitled to such passes for themselves and their wares, should receive every
                        measure of protection due to their just complaint. But transit passes should
                        only be used, in the opinion of the Department, by our citizens in China, to
                        cover and protect merchandise actually owned by them. Any other course seems
                        to be not only opposed to the spirit of the treaty granting such passes, but
                        detrimental to the interests of our citizens engaged in legitimate
                        trade.</p>
                    <p>The habit, therefore, of obtaining transit passes by American citizens <pb
                            n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0201"/>for Chinese principals, to secure
                        for them advantages to which they are not entitled by the laws of their own
                        country, is such an abuse of the privilege as not only to justify the
                        Chinese authorities in refusing to recognize such passes when irregularly
                        issued or obtained, but also in declining to grant additional ones to those
                        found guilty of such practices.</p>
                    <p>You will, therefore, following the intent of this instruction, properly
                        apprise Mr. Shepard, our consul at Hankow, of the views of the
                        Department.</p>

                        Rio de Janeiro June 5 last, had been refused permission to land temporarily

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: There has been much discussion in our
                        diplomatic body as to the rights and duties of neutrals during present
                        complications between <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0204"/>China and
                        France. In my dispatch No. 505, dated September 7, I in-closed a decree from
                        the throne which appeared in the Peking Gazette. Under ordinary
                        circumstances such a proclamation would be regarded as indicative of the
                        actual existence of war, and could impose upon us the duties of
                        neutrals.</p>
                    <p>It has been impossible to obtain from the prince, with whom I have had
                        several conversations, any declaration to the effect that China regards
                        herself at war with France. I have asked for an official copy of the decree,
                        but the answer is that decrees from the throne are domestic incidents and do
                        not concern legations.</p>
                    <p>I learn, furthermore, that M. Jules Ferry has said to European Governments
                        that France does not regard herself as at war with China. A proclamation
                        issued by M. Lemaire, consul-general of France at Shanghai, confirms this
                        belief. At the same time the French at Keelung forcibly prevent a German
                        ship from landing a cargo, and the captain, in doing so, avers that he
                        commits a “belligerent act.”</p>
                    <p>The question has assumed practical shape in various instances. The
                        consul-general and the consul at Tien-Tsin have been asked whether American
                        ships could carry munitions of war for Chinese. I have instructed them that
                        until war is declared our vessels are at liberty to carry any lawful
                        merchandise. The consul at Foo-Chow writes that he has forbidden American
                        pilots to serve on French ships. I have said to him that until we know war
                        exists, American pilots are free to accept any engagements.</p>
                    <p>The yamên, in a note addressed to the Japanese legation, asked the Japanese
                        to refuse coal to the French steamers. The same request was addressed to the
                        Government of Great Britain, as well as to our legation. The especial
                        purpose of the note was to prevent supplies from being furnished at
                        Hong-Kong and Nagasaki. I made no reply to the note beyond a simple
                        acknowledgment. The question has no practical value as far as we are
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>I have been unable to discover any consensus of opinion among my colleagues.
                        I presume they await instructions from their Governments. Sir Harry Parkes
                        gave the British consul at Tien-Tsin the same instructions that I gave Mr.
                        Smithers, namely, that until he had official knowledge of war he could not
                        enter upon the obligations of neutrality. I suggested to Mr. von Brandt that
                        the diplomatic body might unite in a request to the Government for a
                        specific declaration as to the existence of war. Mr. von Brandt did not feel
                        that he could do this, and, beyond some conversations among the members of
                        the diplomatic body of an informal character, there has been no action. I
                        learn from the Japanese minister that China, through the Berlin minister,
                        requested Germany to enter upon the duties of belligerency. Prince Bismarck
                        answered that Germany, before doing so, must have an assurance from China or
                        France that belligerency existed. This assurance China refused to give.</p>
                    <p>I am most anxious that Americans in China should preserve an exact neutrality
                        in the unhappy event of war. At the same time I see no reason for imposing
                        the obligations of neutrality upon our people until we know that war exists.
                        If China and France desire American neutrality, they can make their wishes
                        known through their legations in Washington.</p>
                    <p>I shall take no action looking towards the acceptance of neutral obligations
                        by Americans in China until I have the orders of the Department.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to a conversation which took
                            place on the 11th instant, I have the honor to inform you that I have
                            now learned that my Government has temporarily suspended the issue of
                            certificates to those Chinese subjects who by right are entitled to come
                            to the United States. The reason for this is that the authorities desire
                            to adopt some more perfect and satisfactory measures. This shows that
                            China really desires to maintain her good faith and strengthen the tie
                            of friendship existing between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>Within these last two months there arrived at San Francisco, from
                            Hong-Kong, four steamers, viz, Rio de Janeiro, City of Tokio, Arabic,
                            and City of Peking, with Chinese passengers holding certificates issued
                            under authority of my Government. Their number has been greatly
                            diminished, and I left with you a memorandum containing the exact
                            figures.</p>
                        <p>In short, the Government of China desires to avail herself of the rights
                            or privileges secured by the stipulations of the supplementary treaty,
                            in order to continue her good faith and friendship.</p>
                        <p>I therefore beg to lay this before you, hoping that you, Mr. Secretary,
                            will exercise your impartial judgment and consideration on this matter,
                            in order that the pending Chinese question may be settled in accord with
                            the stipulations of the treaty and the express provision of the fourth
                            article, “to the end that mutual and unqualified benefit may
                            result.”</p>

                            receipt of your note of the 16th instant, stating that the Chinese
                            Government has temporarily suspended, with a view to adopting a more
                            perfect measure, the issue of emigration certificates to those of her
                            subjects who are entitled to visit the United States pursuant to the
                            treaty of November 17, 1880, with China, and the act of Congress
                            approved May 6, 1882, to carry into effect the provisions of that
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>I am desired by the President to say that he sees in the present action
                            of the Chinese Government that spirit of international comity which,
                            while creditable to the dignity of a friendly power like China, for whom
                            we entertain the most cordial feelings, cannot but receive the <pb

                            of the Committees on Foreign Relations and Foreign Affairs of the Senate

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that, since
                            the act relating to Chinese immigration went into effect, whenever
                            resident Chinese subjects who are merchants, travelers, students,
                            &amp;c., have returned to China or have left for other countries, the
                            Chinese consul-general at San Francisco, in accordance with the practice
                            of consuls of other countries, has issued certificates to Chinese
                            subjects leaving the United States. This has enabled them to furnish
                            evidence on re-entering the country, when presented to the collector.
                            This the Chinese consulate has been doing for more than a year with the
                            knowledge of the customs authorities.</p>
                        <p>I have recently received a communication from our consul-general at San
                            Francisco stating that on the 19th ultimo he received a note from the
                            special deputy collector, Mr. Jerome (a copy of which I inclose), in
                            which he states: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>I have determined to issue to Chinese merchants departing from
                                    the United States, on application, a certificate on the form
                                    inclosed, which will be furnished without charge, and be
                                    recognized on return of the holder as <hi rend="italic">prima
                                        facie</hi> evidence of his right to re-enter the United
                                    States. This decision has been made public. Therefore, any
                                    certificates or passports issued by your office after this date
                                    will not be regarded by the customs officers upon presentation,
                                    &amp;c.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I respectfully ask whether this decision is authorized by the Government
                            of the United States?</p>
                        <p>Article I of the supplementary treaty provides that “the limitation or
                            suspension shall be reasonable, and shall apply only to Chinese who go
                            to the United States as laborers, other classes not being included in
                            the limitations.” Article II states that “Chinese subjects, * * * as
                            teachers, students, merchants, or from curiosity, &amp;c., shall be
                            allowed to go and come of their free will and accord, and shall be
                            accorded all the rights, privileges, immunities, and exemptions which
                            are accorded to the citizens and subjects of the most favored nation.”
                            Now, when the Chinese consul-general issues certificates to returning
                            Chinese merchants, they consider it a great convenience; besides, it is
                            the most satisfactory evidence to be used on re-entering the country. If
                            such certificate is totally ignored, it seems to me that privileges,
                            &amp;c., guaranteed by treaty stipulations to the exempted classes,
                            permitting them “to go and come of their own freewill and accord,” and
                            to enjoy the same “rights, privileges, immunities, and exemptions as are
                            enjoyed by the citizens or subjects of the most favored nation,” cannot
                            be enjoyed by resident Chinese merchants, &amp;c., under the above
                            decision.</p>
                        <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0207"/>
                        <p>The collector at San Francisco has been, in accordance with the act,
                            issuing certificates to Chinese laborers leaving this country, but he
                            has never been in the habit of issuing certificates to Chinese merchants
                            departing from this country. In doing this your Government has observed
                            the treaty, treated the latter considerately, and made a distinction
                            between the exempted classes and Chinese laborers. Now, if Chinese
                            merchants and other exempted classes depart from the United States, the
                            collector issues certificates to them. They are thus treated in the same
                            manner as Chinese laborers. The consul-general, being Chinese, knows how
                            to discriminate the different characters among the Chinese
                            residents.</p>
                        <p>If an application for a certificate is made, it is very easy for him to
                            make the investigation. If the Chinese merchants apply to the collector
                            for certificates, nine out of ten not being able to understand the
                            English language, they must depend upon an interpreter. This causes much
                            inconvenience.</p>
                        <p>I lay the above points before you, Mr. Secretary, hoping that you will
                            consider them fairly and justly, in order that the subject be treated in
                            consonance with the provision of the fourth article of the supplementary
                            treaty, “to the end that mutual and unqualified benefit may result.”</p>
                        <p>Accept, sir, &amp;c.,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: This office has held that Chinese
                                merchants, students, &amp;c., arriving in the United States from

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of the 7th instant, relative to a recent
                            certificate which the customs authorities at San Francisco propose to
                            provide for Chinese merchants who are about departing from the United
                            States and intending to return hither, and to say that the subject will
                            have due consideration. To that end I have referred a copy of your note
                            and its accompaniments to the Secretary of the Treasury, whose
                            Department, under the statute, has supervision of the execution of the
                            law of May 6, 1882, to carry into effect the provisions of the treaty of
                            November 17, 1880, between the United States and China, and have asked
                            that he give his careful attention to the arguments advanced by you in
                            opposition to the certificate now proposed, and in favor of that which
                            the Chinese consul-general at San Francisco has heretofore employed in
                            behalf of merchants and other privileged classes under the treaty and
                            law mentioned.</p>

                            at that port propose to issue to Chinese merchants who are about

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I transmit herewith a copy of a letter
                                of March 7, 1884, from the Chinese minister to the Secretary of
                                State, with copies of inclosures numbered 1 and 2, the one dated
                                February 18, 1884, the other dated March 7, 1884, purporting to have
                                been issued from your office. This Department has not been
                                officially notified by you of the issuance of the orders contained
                                in said inclosures. Assuming them to be correctly set forth, and
                                referring to the sixth section of the act of Congress approved May
                                6, 1882, to “execute certain treaty stipulations relating to
                                Chinese,” it appears to this Department that your announcement to
                                the Chinese consul-general that any certificates or passports issued
                                by his office after this date would not be regarded by the customs
                                officers upon presentation is not in accordance with the provisions
                                of said sixths section, which provides that “every Chinese person
                                other than a laborer who may be entitled by said treaty and this act
                                to come within the United States shall be identified as so entitled
                                by the Chinese Government in each case, such identity to be
                                evidenced by a certificate issued under the authority of said
                                Government. * * * Such certificate shall be <hi rend="italic">prima
                                    facie</hi> evidence of the fact set forth therein,” &amp;c.</p>
                            <p>It has been repeatedly held by the courts, notably by Justice Deady,
                                in the United States district court of Oregon, in the case of Ho
                                King, that the right of Chinese other than laborers to come into the
                                United States does not depend upon the production of any certificate
                                whatever, but that the want of such certificate may be supplied by
                                satisfactory evidence <hi rend="italic">aliunde</hi>. For the
                                convenience of Chinese persons not laborers who desire to come into
                                the United States, the sixth section above cited provides that a
                                certificate in the form prescribed, issued under the authority of
                                the Chinese Government, stating that such person is entitled to come
                                into the United States, shall be <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi>
                                evidence of the fact set forth therein.</p>
                            <p>The Department sees no objection to your issuing such certificates as
                                you propose to any proper persons who may apply for them, but it
                                regards certificates issued by the Chinese consul-general at San
                                Francisco as issued under the authority of the Chinese Government,
                                and, if in conformity with said sixth section, entitled to be
                                treated as <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> evidence. Such
                                certificate, however, is not conclusive, and if there is any reason
                                in any case to suspect fraud or imposition, the collector will make
                                a rigid examination and refuse to allow the passenger to land until
                                satisfactory evidence is produced. This conclusion is in accordance
                                with the opinion of the Department of October 25, 1882, S. S. 5446,
                                and with the opinion of Justice Deady above cited.</p>
                            <p>You will govern your course accordingly.</p>
                            <p>Very respectfully,</p>

                            received a communication from Mr. Huang Tsun Hsien, Chinese
                            consul-general at San <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0210"
                            />Francisco, stating that on the 5th June last the steamer Rio de
                            Janeiro arrived at San Francisco with a party of Chinese laborers bound
                            for British Columbia, and applied to the consul-general lor transit
                            certificates, for the purpose of temporarily landing at San Francisco;
                            that Surveyor Morton refused to permit them to land, and that our
                            consul, Mr. F. A. Bee, addressed a note to the collector of customs, Mr.
                            Sears, on the subject, whose reply (a copy of which I inclose) was that—
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Chinese laborers arriving at a port in the United States, and
                                    departing from the same port, are not in transit across the
                                    territory of the United States, and therefore not entitled to
                                    land, but should be kept on board ship and transferred to
                                    another vessel departing for a foreign port, &amp;c.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The opinion of the honorable Attorney General dated 26th December, 1882,
                            to you, Mr. Secretary, sets forth that “this Government does not think
                            that a Chinese laborer coming to this country merely to pass through it
                            can be considered as within the prohibition of the law, he being neither
                            an immigrant nor a laborer coming here <hi rend="italic">as</hi>
                            laborer,” &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The honorable Secretary of the Treasury issued a circular, dated January
                            23, 1883, in relation to the transit of Chinese laborers.</p>
                        <p>Chinese laborers applying to the consul-general for a transit
                            certificate, in transit, either passing through the territory of the
                            United States or touching at San Francisco, in their journey to or from
                            the Hawaiian Islands, Panama, British Columbia, and other places, were
                            carefully examined by him.</p>
                        <p>Having satisfied himself with their status as mere transient passengers,
                            the consul-general issued to them the transit certificates. This
                            practice has been accepted by the collector of customs, who, after
                            examining the transit certificates, has hitherto permitted Chinese in
                            transit to land.</p>
                        <p>There has not been a single case where the Chinese in transit remained in
                            this country arid evaded the circular of the Secretary of the Treasury.
                            Now the collector states that the transit could not be applied to
                            Chinese laborers <hi rend="italic">en route</hi> to British Columbia,
                            and that they should be kept on board ship and transferred to another
                            vessel departing for a foreign port.</p>
                        <p>Besides, there are no steamers running directly to and fro between China,
                            British Columbia, Panama, and other foreign ports on the American
                            continent.</p>
                        <p>Thus Chinese necessarily touch at San Francisco before they can take
                            another steamer going to or from those places. While waiting for a
                            passage, sometimes they have to wait for ten days, and sometimes twenty
                            days, as the departure of the vessel is uncertain. If they are provided
                            with the consular certificate, they are still refused permission to land
                            temporarily; so that the Chinese, wishing either to visit their
                            relatives, or purchase things, or to find friends with whom to confer
                            upon any transaction or business, cannot do so. This really would cause
                            much inconvenience to them.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, if they were refused permission to land temporarily, and kept
                            on board ship to wait for another vessel, despondency would pervade
                            their minds and sickness might arise from it. It seems to me that the
                            United States Government would not do such an inhumane act. Though the
                            Chinese transient passengers are permitted to land temporarily, and wait
                            for a passage by another vessel leaving for a foreign port, yet they do
                            not remain in this country. There is no harm done to the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>I lay this matter before you with a view that you, Mr. Secretary, will
                            exercise your impartial and fair judgment and consideration on the

                            firstly, that the restrictions apply only to Chinese coming to the

                            through this country or touching at one of her ports, and, secondly,
                            that the Chinese transient passengers may be free from

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your communication of yesterday,
                                calling my attention to the circulars of the Secretary of the
                                Treasury dated January 23, 1883, relating to Chinese laborers in
                                transit through the United States, is received, and after a careful
                                examination of said order, and the opinion of the Attorney-General
                                embodied therein, I am of opinion—</p>
                            <p>First. Subdivision 1 requires that when any Chinese laborer in
                                transit through the territory of the United States enters at a port
                                where there is a Chinese consul, said consul may furnish him with a
                                descriptive transit certificate showing the place and date of his
                                arrival, also the place from whence he intends to depart from the
                                United States, and that his journey is to be continuous and direct,
                                &amp;c. Said certificates shall be accepted as <hi rend="italic"
                                    >prima facie</hi> evidence.</p>
                            <p>This first subdivision evidently refers to a Chinese entering one
                                port of the United States and traveling across our territory to some
                                other port in the United States, and thence departing for some
                                foreign port. When the said Chinese reaches the port of departure in
                                the United States, then his said transit certificate shall be
                                received by the customs authorities there as <hi rend="italic">prima
                                    facie</hi> evidence that he had the right only to cross the
                                country, but not to remain in it.</p>
                            <p>Subdivision 2 requires that in the absence of such certificate other
                                evidence may be received of the fact of a <hi rend="italic">bona
                                    fide</hi> transit across the territory of the United States
                                intended to be traversed. This subdivision also contemplates that
                                the person is to traverse the territory of the United States to some
                                other port for departure.</p>
                            <p>Subdivision 3 relates to a number of Chinese under charge of an
                                agent, who may make affidavit that he will transport them without
                                delay across the territory of the United States and deliver them on
                                board ship. The purport of this subdivision is that the agent will
                                take his body of Chinese from the port of entry to the port of exit,
                                without unnecessary delay, <hi rend="italic">across the territory of
                                    the United States</hi>, and place them on board some ship
                                leaving for a foreign port. Again, this subdivision requires
                                descriptive lists of all such Chinese to be made, showing the <hi
                                    rend="italic">place</hi> of arrival and <hi rend="italic"
                                    >place</hi> of intended departure, the route to be traveled, and
                                that a copy of the same shall be forwarded to the collector of
                                customs at the <hi rend="italic">port of exit</hi>, who will see
                                that they all duly leave the United States.</p>
                            <p>It is clear Jo my mind that the whole tenor and purport of the order
                                was intended to and does relate to Chinese crossing the territory of
                                the United States.</p>
                            <p>I am further of the opinion that Chinese laborers arriving at a port
                                in the United States and departing from the same port are not <hi
                                    rend="italic">in transit</hi> across the territory of the United
                                States, and therefore not entitled to laud, but should be kept on
                                board ship and transferred to another vessel departing for a foreign
                                port, to which their tickets entitle them to go.</p>
                            <p>In regard to the system of “bonded security” established by you as a
                                guarantee for the return of a Chinese lauded who is in transit from
                                one foreign port to another via this, arriving at and departing from
                                this port, I beg to state that the bond does not run to the United
                                States, and, if it did, I have been unable to find any authority of
                                law for such bond.</p>
                            <p>A bond given to permit the performance of au unlawful act is void;
                                therefore I must respectfully decline to grant permission for the
                                said Chinese to land.</p>
                            <p>I am, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that I have
                            received from Mr. Huang Tsun Hsien, Chinese consul-general at San
                            Francisco, a telegram in substance as follows:</p>
                        <p>There arrived in San Francisco on the 28th instant twenty-four Chinese
                            merchants holding Chinese consular passports or certificates issued by
                            that consulate. The holders are hot permitted to land, by order and
                            indorsement made by the collector as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Refused to land, on account of noncompliance of new law.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>These certificates are the same as referred to by the Secretary of the
                            Treasury in a letter to the collector dated March 14, 1884; also a
                            letter of the Secretary of State to his excellency the Chinese minister
                            dated March 19, 1884. The steamship left China before the passage of the
                            new law, and the exempt class could not comply with its provisions. If
                            the action of the collector is carried out in these cases, it will be a
                            great hardship to the Chinese merchants. Immediate attention is desired
                            to this, as the ship departs on the 7th of August.</p>
                        <p>I submit most respectfully this matter to your excellency’s just and
                            impartial consideration, in the hope that your excellency will kindly
                            request the honorable Secretary of the Treasury to grant those
                            twenty-four Chinese merchants permission to land.</p>
                        <p>Such action on your part will be esteemed a great favor, and will be a
                            further evidence of the friendly disposition of your Government towards
                            that of China.</p>

                        <p>The case presented is where a party of Chinese laborers, bound for
                            British Columbia, arrived at San Francisco on board of the steamer Bio
                            de Janeiro, June 5 last, and were refused permission to land by the
                            customs authorities at that port, who required that the Chinese should
                            be kept on shipboard until their transfer direct to another vessel
                            departing for their place of destination.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese minister accordingly refers to the custom hitherto in force
                            in regard to the transit of such Chinese across our territory, and
                            complains that the decision of the customs authorities at San Francisco
                            is in conflict with the opinion of the Attorney-General upon the general
                            subject involved in such transit, dated December 26, 1882, to which
                            reference is made.</p>
                        <p>In the case under consideration the point appears to have been, according
                            to the interpretation of the law of May 6, 1882, by the customs
                            authorities at San Francisco, that Chinese laborers arriving at a port
                            in the United States from which they must take their departure for their
                            destination outside our territory cannot be said to be <hi rend="italic"
                                >in transitu</hi>, and consequently are not privileged to land.</p>
                        <p>Under the provisions of the act of Congress of May 6, 1882, the Secretary
                            of the Treasury, as you are aware, was charged with the execution of the
                            same, and I cannot permit myself to believe nor to think that the
                            Chinese minister himself doubts that the collector of the port of San
                            Francisco was prompted by any other motive than that of rigidly
                            enforcing the letter of the law, in pursuance of his understood
                            instructions, <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0214"/>having, at the
                            same time, due regard for the personal rights and privileges of a class
                            of inhibited persons.</p>
                        <p>The minister’s note itself, moreover, confirms me in the opinion that in
                            all previous cases where Chinese laborers have come to the United States
                            and have necessarily proceeded by our territory to their place of
                            residence in a foreign country, every reasonable and proper measure for
                            their comfort and convenience has been cheerfully accorded. It may, I
                            think, be safely assumed, then, that the action of the collector in not
                            permitting the Chinese laborers to land, under the circumstances of the
                            present case, was from a sincere and natural desire to perform his duty
                            as he understood it.</p>
                        <p>Be that as it may, the question will at once be referred to the
                            Attorney-General, to decide what the rights of Chinese laborers <hi
                                rend="italic">in transitu</hi>, are in view of the recent
                            legislation of July 5, 1884, two copies of which law I herewith
                            transmit.</p>
                        <p>It is no doubt a fact that the Chinese laborers who arrived at San
                            Francisco by the Rio de Janeiro have ere this sailed for their
                            destination.</p>
                        <p>I shall at once inclose copies of this correspondence to the Secretary of
                            the Treasury, and upon receiving the opinion of the Attorney-General
                            make haste to acquaint you with its purport.</p>

                            telegram has been received from Mr. Huang Tsun Hsien, Chinese
                            consul-general at San Francisco, stating that several Chinese merchants
                            who have been in business for many years in the United States, and
                            bearing certificates issued by the Chinese consulate under the act of
                            1882, arrived at San Francisco, with their families, in the steamer City
                            of Peking, on the 1st instant, and were refused permission to land by
                            the collector of customs at that port, on the ground that their
                            certificates do not comply with the amended restriction act of July 5,
                            1884.</p>
                        <p>These merchants have long been residing in the United States, and their
                            property and personal effects are all in this country, and as they have
                            certificates issued by the Chinese consulate, under the authority of the
                            Chinese Government, it is clear that they have the right under treaty to
                            return to the United States.</p>
                        <p>I shall be grateful to you, Mr. Secretary, if you will cause the
                            necessary instructions to be issued which will result in the liberation
                            of these merchants and families; and as they are at present confined on
                            shipboard, their case is one which asks for immediate attention.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that I have
                            received a communication from Mr. Huang Tsun Hsien, Chinese
                            consul-general at San Francisco, stating that he is daily receiving
                            applications from Chinese merchants residing in California for
                            certificates of identification, who desire to proceed to China and
                            foreign countries and return to the United States.</p>
                        <p>The subject having been brought to the notice of the collector of customs
                            at San Francisco, he states that he cannot readmit any Chinese belonging
                            to the exempt class to the country on a certificate issued here. During
                            an argument recently made in the United States court, Judge Hoffman
                            presiding, the court questioned the collector as to his views of the
                            status of the exempt class of Chinese residents under section 6 of the
                            amended restriction act, and he replied as follows:’ “The certificate
                            must be issued in China by the Chinese Government, and viséd there.”</p>
                        <p>The court then asked his views in regard to Chinese residing in foreign
                            countries and who desire to come to the United States. The collector
                            replied, “They must go to China and obtain certificates before they can
                            come to the United States.”</p>
                        <p>If the position of the collector be sustained, it follows that Chinese
                            merchants and others belonging to the exempted class residing in the
                            United States cannot visit China or any other country and return without
                            obtaining credentials in China.</p>
                        <p>It also follows that Chinese exempts residing in foreign countries cannot
                            come to the United States without first visiting China to obtain
                            credentials.</p>
                        <p>Upon examining the treaty of 1880, I find that the restrictions apply
                            only to Chinese laborers and not to Chinese merchants, who have the
                            right “to go and come of their own free will and accord.”</p>
                        <p>Now, the collector’s decision, holding that these merchants must go to
                            China to procure certificates before they may go abroad and return,
                            impairs their right under the treaty, and I cannot believe this is the
                            meaning of section 6 of the amended act. The section evidently alludes
                            only to Chinese persons of the exempted class residing in China “who
                            shall be about to come to the United States;” but no provision seems to
                            have been made for the Chinese exempts residing in this country, nor for
                            those in foreign countries, unless they are subjects of the latter. The
                            certificate of the Chinese Government evidences the right of the holder
                            “to come within the United States.”</p>
                        <p>Many of the Chinese merchants in the United States have large interests
                            in Victoria, British Columbia, the Sandwich Islands, Cuba, and Panama.
                            Scarcely a steamer arrives from or departs for those countries without
                            one or more of the class mentioned as passengers.</p>
                        <p>A large number of certificates was issued last year to this class of
                            exempts by the Chinese consulate at San Francisco, under the act of
                            1882, and many of the holders have not yet returned to the United
                            States. In a note of the Treasury Department to the collector at San
                            Francisco, dated March 14, 1884, and inclosed in one of your
                            excellency’s <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0216"/>notes to the
                            Chinese minister, it is stated that the certificate issued by the
                            Chinese consul-general at San Francisco is to be regarded as issued
                            under the authority of the Chinese Government, in conformity with the
                            sixth section of the act approved May 6, 1882, and that such certificate
                            is to be recognized as <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> evidence of
                            the holder’s right to return to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Now, if the collector at San Francisco insists that these merchants
                            cannot be readmitted into the United States without going to China to
                            obtain new certificates, it would result in a great hardship to them,
                            and would, in effect, prohibit their trade between those places above
                            mentioned and the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Government will find it next to impossible to identify its
                            subjects who have been for many years living abroad, and whose property
                            and business are either in the United States or other countries.</p>
                        <p>It would also be impossible for the American consuls in China to
                            ascertain the facts. Judge Hoffman, in the case referred to above, asked
                            the collector, “How can a Chinese merchant who has been living in London
                            or Valparaiso for twenty-five years be identified in China”</p>
                        <p>It seems to me, however, that if the certificates be issued by a Chinese
                            consul, this class of Chinese exempts will be properly identified, and
                            that it will not violate the amended act.</p>
                        <p>Large numbers of Chinese merchants here desire to visit China and other
                            countries on business, and, before doing so, they are pressing the
                            Chinese consulate with the question of their right to return. I am
                            therefore compelled to ask of your excellency a reply to the subjoined
                            questions: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Where Chinese subjects residing in the United States and
                                    belonging to the exempted class desire to visit China or any

                                    that prescribed by section 6 of the amended act, and presented
                                    by them, be considered <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi>

                                    the Chinese Government, conforming to that prescribed by section
                                    6 of the amended act, and presented by them, be considered <hi

                        <p>An interpretation of the law on these points, Mr. Secretary, will give
                            great satisfaction to a large number of Chinese subjects, and I venture

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of the 4th instant, in regard to a party of Chinese
                            merchants who have lately <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0217"
                            />arrived at San Francisco, with their families, in the steamer City of
                            Peking, and who have been refused permission to land by the collector of
                            customs, on the ground that their certificates, being those issued under
                            the act of 1882, do not conform to those required by the supplementary
                            act of July 5, 1884.</p>
                        <p>I accordingly referred a copy of your note to the Secretary of the
                            Treasury for his consideration.</p>
                        <p>By a letter from the Acting Secretary, of the 10th instant, it appears
                            the collector at San Francisco was directed by telegraph to report the
                            facts in respect of your complaint. His report confirmed your statement
                            that the Chinese had not been allowed to land because they had not the
                            certificates prescribed by the act of Congress of July 5, 1884. It was
                            also stated that twenty six claimed the right to land on Chinese
                            consular certificates issued to them at San Francisco prior to the
                            passage of the act mentioned, and that the remainder had no certificates
                            of any character.</p>
                        <p>This Department is informed that the judges of the United States circuit
                            court at San Francisco have recently disagreed as to whether any
                            evidence other than that prescribed by the statute of July, 1884, can be
                            accepted as authority for permitting the landing in the United States of
                            those Chinese who may fall under the provisions of that act.</p>
                        <p>This disagreement makes it necessary to have the question decided by the
                            Supreme Court of the United States, to which it has been referred, and
                            the executive branch of the Government, while inhibited by
                            constitutional precepts from taking any step which might seem to
                            interfere with the complete independence of the judicial branch, will
                            endeavor to cause a speedy decision to be reached, in order that no
                            undue hardships may accrue through delay, to those persons whose
                            statutory rights are in question.</p>

                            instant, in which he states that, as desired by this Department,
                            application has been made to the Supreme Court of the United States for
                            an advancement of the <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> case of Chew

                            has fixed upon Monday next, “foot of the docket,” for such hearing.</p>

                            treaty of 1880 with China, may receive an early interpretation by the
                            highest judicial tribunal in this country, and that such rights as
                            properly belong to certain of His Majesty’s subjects under the law and
                            treaty may be conserved.</p>

                                        and who may desire to depart from and return to the United

                                        July 5, 1884, to be issued by a Chinese consular officer
                                        stationed within the United States. Certificates issued
                                        under the act of May 6, 1882, and decision 6240, before the
                                        passage of said act of 1884, are to be regarded as having
                                        the same effect as if said act of 1884 had not been

                                    <item>Second. Chinese subjects, not laborers, desiring to come
                                        to the United States from countries other than China, may do
                                        so on production of a certificate corresponding to that
                                        required by section 6 of the act of July 5, 1884, to be
                                        issued by a Chinese diplomatic or consular officer, if there
                                        be one at the port of departure, countersigned by a United
                                        States consular officer, or if there be no such Chinese
                                        officer stationed at such port, on a like certificate to be
                                        issued by a United States consular officer.</item>

                                        dated January 23, 1883, relative to the transit of Chinese
                                        laborers through the territory of the United States, will be
                                        applied to all Chinese persons intending to so go in transit

                                    <item>Fourth. Chinese persons who may be compelled to touch at
                                        ports of the United States in transit to foreign countries
                                        may be permitted to land, under the regulations of January

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Although the work of cutting the Panama Canal
                        was commenced nearly three years ago, and has been extended throughout
                        almost its entire length, yet the most important practical question
                        connected with the enterprise has during all this time been left undecided.
                        I allude, of course, to the question of locks.</p>
                    <p>At the International Canal Congress held in Paris in May, 1879, it was shown
                        by American and English engineers who had made the matter a subject of
                        special and careful study that the opening of a maritime water-way across
                        the Isthmus of Panama without locks and parallel sluices would be an
                        impossibility. Nevertheless, Messrs. Wyse and de Lesseps, who had never
                        surveyed the route, but who held an exclusive “concession” from the
                        Colombian Government, reiterated their purpose to open a canal from Colon to
                        Panama <hi rend="italic">à niveau</hi>, “without locks or hindrances of any
                        kind.” And since the “congress “had been called merely to ratify what these
                        distinguished gentlemen and their associates had already agreed upon, their
                        “plan” was finally adopted, amid much confusion, by a vote of 72 against
                        61.</p>
                    <p>It now turns out, however, despite the confident and oft-repeated assertions
                        of M. de Lesseps to the contrary, that at least two locks will be necessary;
                        and that, in addition, there will have to be parallel canals for the
                        reception of the waters of the Chagres and other rivers, which range all the
                        way from 42 to 78 feet above the sea-level, thus augmenting the original
                        cost of the canal by nearly one-third.</p>

                        <p rend="center">[From our correspondent.]</p>
                        <p>M. Dingier, the chief engineer of the Panama Canal Company, has just laid
                            a report before the superior works committee which is of great interest
                            to international commerce. Though the work of cutting the canal has been
                            commenced throughout almost its entire length, yet several of the most
                            important questions concerning the creation of the maritime water-way
                            across the Isthmus of Panama had been left undecided. The report I now
                            have before me, and which I have had some trouble to <pb n="120"
                                xml:id="pg_120" facs="0220"/>procure, contains the solutions which
                            it is proposed should he given those questions. Most people are under
                            the impression that the entrance to the Panama Canal is to be open to
                            the sea, without any locks or other hindrances. This, indeed, may have
                            been the primitive intention of the originators of the scheme, hut a
                            more thorough study of the question has shown that though it would be
                            possible to construct the canal under those conditions, there are
                            forcible reasons for closing the canal with a lock-chamber at the
                            extremity where it will join the Pacific Ocean. It has been ascertained
                            that the tides in the Atlantic and Pacific differ very materially. At
                            Colon, on the Atlantic, the difference between high and low water mark
                            is not more than 58 centimeters, whereas at Panama, on the Pacific the
                            average variation in the height of the water is 4 meters, and is
                            sometimes no less than 6. Moreover, high water at Colon is about nine
                            hours later than at Panama; therefore, when it is high or low tide at
                            Panama the tide at Colon is half way between high and low. The maximum
                            difference which could exist between the level of the waters of the two
                            oceans would therefore be equal to half the height to which the tide
                            rises at Panama, on the Pacific. If the canal communicated freely with
                            the two oceans, there would be an alternate current from the Atlantic to
                            the Pacific and from the Pacific to the Atlantic, the duration of each
                            current being about six hours. It may be said that there would,
                            moreover, be no slack water, as the level of the water in the two oceans
                            is reached at the moment when the tide runs the strongest, that is to
                            say, at half water at Panama. It would, under these circumstances, be
                            rash to attempt to calculate the rapidity of the currents in the canal
                            which would result from that situation. By comparison with the canals
                            and rivers which empty themselves into the Bay of Biscay, M. Dingier,
                            however, estimated that it would be something like 2 meters or 2½ meters
                            per second. Naturally, at the point where a vessel was passing, the
                            strength of the current would be increased in proportion to the size of
                            the ship and the amount of water it displaced in the comparatively
                            narrow channel. It is therefore clear to M. Dingier that if the canal
                            were to be allowed to communicate freely with the two oceans the
                            rapidity of the current in the canal would necessitate a suspension of
                            navigation during a certain number of hours at each tide. It is clear,
                            from the above, that the transit power of the canal would be
                            considerably increased if it were possible to prevent the formation of
                            the currents in the canal which would result from the action of the
                            tides. To keep the promise made by M. Ferdinand de Lesseps, and to
                            satisfy the requirements of navigation, it is necessary that vessels
                            should be able to pass out of the canal into the Pacific and enter it
                            from the ocean, at all times of the tide, without either difficulty or
                            obstacle and without preoccupation concerning currents produced in the
                            canal by the tide. To realize this, M. Dingier explains that it will
                            suffice to establish lock-chambers at the Panama extremity of the canal.
                            To enable vessels of all dimensions to enter and pass out of the canal
                            at the Pacific end at all times, M. Dingier proposes that it should be
                            made to terminate in three branches, each furnished with a lock-chamber
                            capable of containing a vessel 180 meters long, one branch to be used by
                            vessels entering the canal, the second for ships passing out into the
                            ocean, and the third to be employed when one or other of the entrances
                            may be under repair. The channel, 100 meters wide, leading from the sea
                            to these locks, will have a uniform depth of 9 meters below low-water
                            mark. It is estimated that to get a vessel through these locks will not
                            take more than half an hour, which time will be much more than
                            compensated for by the absence of strong currents in the canal. The
                            construction of these locks at the Pacific end will enable the company
                            to economize in the cost of constructing the canal something like
                            33,500,000 francs. If the entrance to the canal at Panama were not
                            closed by locks, firstly (as M. Dingier proves in his report), the
                            current would be so strong as to make the suspension of navigation
                            necessary at certain times, and, secondly, the bed of the canal could
                            not be made level from the Atlantic to the Pacific! It would be
                            necessary to make it slope from Colon to Panama, the bed of the canal at
                            Panama being made 2 meters below the level of the bottom of the canal at
                            Colon. This would necessitate the removal of 10,000,000 cubic meters of
                            soil, which would cost about 45,000,000 francs. The lock-chambers,
                            &amp;c., would cost about 11,500,000 francs, but their construction
                            would permit of the same level being preserved from Colon to Panama, and
                            thus spare the difference between 45,000,000 francs and 11,500,000
                            francs. M. Dingier points out that the economy of the 33,500,000 franca
                            might thus be made, but leaves it to the superior works committee to
                            decide the matter. If it should not determine to spare that outlay, he
                            asserts that the locks at the Panama end should, nevertheless, be
                            constructed, and the entrance to the canal at Panama closed whenever the
                            currents were found too strong. M. Dingler’s report then proceeds to
                            explain how it is proposed to establish the port of Panama. It will be
                            created on the canal, higher up than the locks. Calculating that it may
                            be necessary to accommodate fifty vessels and a large number of local
                            boats, it is proposed that for a distance of 5½ kilometers the minimum
                            width of the canal shall be 160 meters. Vessels will thus be able to
                            take up their positions on each side of the canal, and still leave a
                            clear passage in the middle of at least 100 meters. At Colon the harbor
                            will be created by the construction of a breakwater, which will protect
                            the vessels from the heavy seas which so often prevail <pb n="121"
                                xml:id="pg_121" facs="0221"/>in the Bay of Limon. To render the
                            Panama canal a success there is a difficulty to be surmounted which did
                            not present itself in the cutting of the Suez Canal. It is that of the
                            presence of a large volume, of water on the Isthmus. The rivers which
                            would join the canal are, on the right bank, the Chagres, the Frijoles,
                            the Agua Sarne, and the Gatuncillo; and on the left bank, the Obispo,
                            the Baila Monos, the Jigaute, the Caño Quebrada, and the Emnidad. M.
                            Dingier points out that it would be quite impossible to entertain the
                            idea of permitting the immense volume of water which is carried by these
                            streams and rivers, especially in the rainy season, to flow into the
                            maritime canal, for it would cause violent currents, and the deposit
                            which the water from the hills would leave in the canal would very
                            shortly impede the navigation, and possibly necessitate its suspension.
                            Without going into the long engineering particulars, it will suffice to
                            say that it is proposed that this superabundance of river water shall be
                            taken down to the sea by fresh-water canals on each side of the maritime
                            canal. To avert the danger of floods during heavy rains, it is also
                            proposed to create an immense reservoir in the upper valley of the
                            Chagres. In conclusion, I may add that M. Dingier advises the creation
                            of one large siding, about 5 kilometers long, half way between Colon and
                            Panama, where two trains of as many as 25 vessels each could pass each
                            other without either inconvenience or danger.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In August last I reported that, according” to
                        the representations of Br. Galindo, minister of finance, the Panama Canal
                        Company had agreed to loan the Colombian Government a half million dollars
                        for two years, at 6 per cent, per annum, “without security or guarantee,”
                        and that this loan was quite independent of the $50,000 which the company
                        had previously agreed to pay to the Government annually for the maintenance
                        of a police force along the line of the projected canal. (See my Nos. 91 and
                        103, Foreign Relations of 1883.)</p>
                    <p>Bills were drawn upon the company in Paris accordingly, but one of them (for
                        200,000 francs) has been protested, on the ground, that, as the half million
                        loan was to include the $50,000 above referred to, the Government had
                        already overdrawn its account. In reply to this Dr. Galindo now makes public
                        a cablegram from M. de Lesseps, dated Paris, October 19 last, wherein it is
                        admitted that the $50,000 was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> included in the
                        loan of half a million subsequently agreed upon.</p>
                    <p>The affair has created some excitement here, and, I may add, some anxiety on
                        the part of the bank under whose indorsement the bills were negotiated. But
                        it will probably end in the payment of the protested bill by the company, as
                        it now has a special agent here trying to secure possession of certain waste
                        lands on the Isthmus stipulated for in the Salgar-Wyse contract of March,

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: You are already aware of the controversy
                        between the Colombian Government and the Panama Canal Company resulting from
                        the <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0222"/>purchase by the latter of the

                        salient points may be briefly stated as follows:</p>
                    <p>The Colombian Government claims (1) that the canal company should pay the
                        expenses of keeping up such a military force as may be necessary to maintain
                        order and give security to the interoceanic transit along the line of the
                        canal works, in accordance with a fair interpretation of article 8 of the
                        contract of March 23, 1878;<note n="*" xml:id="d73fn1">Made March 20, but
                            ratified by Congress March 23, 1878.</note> and (2) that the company
                        should pay to Colombia the indemnity reserved to the Republic in article 2
                        of the contract of July 5, 1867, with the Panama Railway Company, since by
                        article 3 of the contract of March 23, 1878, this indemnity is made part of
                        the consideration for the concessions to the canal company.</p>
                    <p>With reference to the first named, it seems that the company in Paris refuses
                        to ratify the agreements of the 6th of June last, made with its agent in
                        Bogota, for the payment of $55,000 annually for the maintenance of a
                        military force along the line of the canal works, and that it now offers to
                        pay only $20,000 annually for that purpose, which Colombia rejects. The
                        clause of the contract (of March 23, 1878) on which the Government bases
                        this claim is the last sentence in article 8, and reads as follows: “Será
                        igualmente de cargo de la compañía el pago de los gastos que ocasione la
                        mantencion de la fuerza publica que se juzque necesario para la seguridad
                        del tránsito interoceánico;” or, being translated, provides that “the
                        expenses occasioned by the maintenance of such a public force as may be
                        deemed necessary to the security of the interoceanic transit shall be
                        likewise paid by the company.” The company, however, construes this as
                        relating to the water transit, after the canal shall have been opened.</p>
                    <p>With reference to the second claim above mentioned, it is predicated upon the
                        following clause in article 3 of the contract of March 23, 1878, and which I
                        translate as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>If the line of the canal to he opened from ocean to ocean should pass
                                to the westward and northward of an imaginary straight line
                                connecting Cape Tiburon with Point Garachine, the grantees shall
                                come to some amicable understanding with the Panama Railway Company,
                                or pay to it an indemnity to be determined according to the
                                provisions in law 46, of the 16th of August, 1867, approving the
                                contract of July 5, 1867, and amendatory of the law of April 15,
                                1850, relative to the construction of a railway from ocean to ocean

                        modified contract with the Panama Railway Company of July 5, 1867, the
                        second article of which, in the English text, is as follows: <quote

                            <p>The Government of the Republic binds itself, during the time that the
                                exclusive privilege which is conceded to the company for the working
                                of the railroad remains in force, not to construct for itself nor to

                                also stipulates that while the said privilege continues in force the

                                to the company to give its consent does not extend to its opposing
                                the construction of a canal across the Isthmus of Panama (except on
                                the actual route of the railroad itself), hut only to its exacting
                                an equitable price for such privilege, and as indemnification for
                                the damages which the railroad company may suffer by the rivalry or
                                competition of the canal.</p>

                                be without appeal. In pronouncing their decision the arbitrators
                                shall take into consideration the grounds upon which the company
                                rests and the information which the Government shall give upon the
                                matter, and in view thereof they shall decide, without appeal, as
                                they may deem most just and equitable. The sum, whatever it may be,
                                which shall be finally designated, shall belong, one-half to the

                    <p>The Colombian Government contends, therefore, that whilst it is optional with
                        the railroad company to demand indemnity, its failure to do so does not
                        destroy Colombia’s right to demand the moiety of such damages caused to the
                        railway by the canal as may meet her approval or as may be fixed by
                        arbitration; that if the canal company, in disregard of the reversionary
                        interests of the Government in the railroad, have made certain negotiations
                        with the railway company which evince a purpose to destroy or avoid rights
                        incident to those interests and contrary to the spirit of the contract of
                        March 23, 1878, the nation may, and ought to, demand of it damages therefor;
                        that if those negotiations took the form of a purchase, at an exorbitant
                        price, of a majority of the shares in the railway company, merely for the
                        purpose of avoiding the payment of indemnity, the injury caused to the
                        railway itself by opening a canal within the limits named will be none the
                        less real; and that, as the Government was not consulted in such
                        transaction, its rights in the railway cannot be held to be nullified or in
                        any way impaired by it; consequently, the Government, as the ultimate owner
                        of the railway, has no other alternative than in a demand upon the canal
                        company for the moiety of any damages caused to it by the opening of a
                        maritime canal along its line.</p>
                    <p>For the purpose of pressing this claim upon the canal company the Government
                        commissioned a special agent<note n="*" xml:id="d73fn2">Dr. Gil Colunje, of
                            Panama, formerly Colombian minister for foreign affairs.</note> to treat
                        with it in Paris.</p>
                    <p>The agent was courteously received, but his mission has proved an utter
                        failure. The company, when pressed by him for some expression, stated quite
                        plainly that the demand as presented could not be entertained. This led to a
                        lengthy and somewhat acrimonious correspondence between Dr. Galindo,
                        Colombian minister of finance, and M. de Lesseps, which you will find in the
                        report to which I have already referred, but which, up to the present time,
                        seems to have been wholly barren of any practical results.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: You are aware that the concession by the
                        Government of Colombia to the Panama Canal Company includes large grants of
                        land, not only along the line and at the termini of the canal itself, but
                        also 500,000 hectares (or, say, about 800,000 acres) at such other places on
                        or near the Isthmus as the company may select; and the Department has been
                        already advised that the Colombian Executive, acting under authority
                        conferred by law 28, of May 18, 1878, formally ceded to the company, in
                        December last, the lands stipulated for in the concession referred to. A
                        board of commissioners appointed and sent out by the company in Paris is now
                        understood to be engaged in locating and surveying these lands; and the
                        company, it seems, no longer conceals a purpose to people them with French
                        colonists, under the auspices of the French Government.</p>
                    <p>I learn that among the lands likely to be selected by this commission, is the
                        uninhabited island of Coiba, on the outskirts of the Bay of Panama.</p>
                    <p>This island contains an area of about 140 square miles, and is said to be
                        well supplied with fresh water and forest timber. It has, I believe, a very
                        snug little harbor on the seaward side. A glance at the map will show its
                        importance as a maritime station. It commands the approaches to the bay from
                        the South Pacific. * * *</p>
                    <p>I infer, as well from certain intimations by the company’s representative in
                        this city as from the reports made to this legation by Mr. Consul A damson,
                        that the commission will endeavor to select a large tract of land near the
                        port of David, in the district of Chiriqui, and that, in addition to its
                        probable selections on the opposite or Atlantic side, it has in view a small
                        uninhabited island or headland on the same coast.</p>
                    <p>These facts in themselves considered may not be deemed very important; but
                        when considered in connection with the circumstances attending the Paris
                        congress of May, 1879, and the subsequently developed foreign policy of the
                        French Government, they are probably not without significance.</p>

                        tendered to Min Yong Ik, of the late Chosunese embassy to this Government,
                        and two of his suite whom he should select, passage to Corea on board of the
                        United States ship Trenton, which is soon to depart for eastern waters. The

                        receipt of a letter from the Secretary of the Navy of the 3d instant, in

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of
                        your dispatch No. 27, giving a detailed account of the reception and
                        attentions accorded to the special mission accredited by His Majesty the
                        King of Tah Cho-sun to the Government of the United States. It is
                        unnecessary for me to refer to the great Interest which I have felt
                        personally in the success of this mission.</p>
                    <p>The members of the embassy have not as yet reached Seoul, but already rumors
                        of the cordial welcome extended to them by the Government and people of the
                        United States are in circulation.</p>
                    <p>The opportunity afforded them to examine not only the practical working of
                        our system of Government but to see our industries and to learn our sources
                        of wealth and prosperity, as well as to come directly in contact with our
                        citizens and to experience so many acts of personal kindness, cannot but
                        produce a marked and beneficial result upon this strange and interesting
                        people.</p>
                    <p>That they will surely and readily adopt advanced ideas there is no doubt, and
                        out of the new growth will come national prosperity and <pb n="126"
                            xml:id="pg_126" facs="0226"/>individual amelioration. Aside from any
                        commercial considerations, the part which our Government has taken in this
                        regeneration is not devoid of satisfaction.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: As an indication of the sluggishness of
                        commerce in Corea I may mention that, exclusive of the Japanese and Chinese,
                        only two foreign commercial houses, one American and the other British, have
                        thus far made any attempt to establish agencies here. There is one notable
                        cause for this, viz, there being no money other than copper cash, the
                        traffic must necessarily be done by bartering one product for another; and
                        our people either cannot successfully compete with the Japanese and Chinese,
                        or they do not care to engage in this small business. It takes time to
                        educate these people to their own necessities and to the superiority of
                        foreign wares, and that pioneer work necessarily involves loss. I notice,
                        however, small lots of coal-oil, foreign cotton goods, and other commodities
                        on sale in the Corean shops. The export of Corean products will gradually
                        stimulate the production and thus, with the means to purchase, the demand
                        for foreign mer, chandise will increase.</p>

                        cannot as yet see my way clearly, but I hope to soon.” Himself and Mr. Hong

                        inclosed, inviting the captain and other officers of the United States ship

                        already been prepared for this purpose. I at once dispatched a messenger to

                        at court. Upon that occasion His Majesty took the opportunity again to

                        occasions received visits from the French Catholic priests stationed in
                        Corea. Taking care that the fact of such visits was made known to His
                        Majesty, I have, also, from time to time, freely expressed my opinion in
                        regard to religious liberty, saying that it was one of the fundamental
                        principles of our Government that every man should have the right to worship
                        God <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0228"/>according to the dictates of
                        his own conscience, and that all persecution tor opinion’s sake was held in
                        utter abhorrence. In July last the Rev. R. S. Maclay, D. D., a Protestant
                        missionary stationed many years in the East, visited Corea, with the view,
                        if possible, of establishing a mission school and hospital. During his stay
                        at Seôul he was a guest at this legation, and the object of his visit was
                        freely discussed. There seemed to be no serious objection, and since his
                        departure I have received the assurance of His Majesty that not only will no
                        obstacle be thrown in the way, but that the establishment of a mission
                        school and hospital at Seoul will be tacitly encouraged.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The action of those opposed to the free
                        admission of American pork has produced such a result that all the efforts
                        made by this legation during many months to obtain an entirely satisfactory
                        settlement of this vexed question are likely to prove fruitless.</p>
                    <p>About two weeks ago Mr. Gaudin, a deputy from Nantes, the center of the
                        French pork-packing business, introduced in the House a bill providing for a
                        system of inspection of all salted pork coming from abroad. This bill, which
                        is substantially the same as the one voted by the Chamber last year, but
                        defeated in the Senate, and of which I sent a translation to the Department
                        with my No. 146 of March 31, 1882, was referred to a committee, where it was
                        expected to remain without being acted upon by the committee.</p>
                    <p>A few days ago, quite unexpectedly, Mr. Paul Bert, formerly a member of Mr.
                        Gambetta’s cabinet and a scientist of note, asked the Government in the
                        Chamber to suspend the operation of the decree of November 27, again
                        admitting the free importation of American pork, until the Chamber should
                        have acted upon the bill introduced by Mr. Gaudin. Mr. Paul Bert grounded
                        his request on motives of public health; he described in vivid terms the
                        fearful consequences of an epidemic of trichinosis, and asserted that he
                        knew from his own personal experiments as well as by those made by others
                        that trichinae did not exist in French pork and did exist in foreign
                        pork.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Herisson, the minister of commerce, replied to Mr. Paul Bert that the
                        Government could not comply with his request; that its action in the matter
                        had been duly considered, and that he and his colleagues were satisfied that
                        the free importation of American pork would not be attended with any danger
                        to the public health.</p>
                    <p>This plain and unequivocal answer did not satisfy Mr. Paul Bert, who moved to
                        interpellate the Government on the question. The interpellation <pb n="129"
                            xml:id="pg_129" facs="0229"/>was granted, and it came before the House
                        on Saturday last, the 22d instant.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Paul Bert repeated his request to suspend the operation of the decree
                        canceling the one prohibiting American pork until some definite action be
                        taken by the Chamber, and submitted the following order of the day:</p>
                    <p>“The Chamber considering that it is proper to delay the admission of American
                        pork until after the debate upon the bill now pending, passes to the order
                        of the day.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Herisson declared that he was obliged to oppose this order of the day;
                        that, as stated before, the Government had acted only after mature
                        deliberation, and upon the advice of the Academy of Medicine; that not a
                        single case of trichinosis had been detected either in England, in Belgium,
                        and in Switzerland, where American pork is freely introduced, or in France
                        when free importation was the rule; that the epidemic of trichinosis, which
                        recently appeared in Germany, was known to have been caused by German pork,
                        and that consequently there was no good reason to recall a measure which was
                        satisfactory to so many people and open to so little objection.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Paul Bert said that the facts stated by the minister were not as
                        conclusive as he supposed they were; that trichinosis was not easily
                        detected; that its diagnosis was exactly the same as typhoid fever, and that
                        it was very likely that many people had died of it without the cause being
                        made known; and that, contrary to an opinion generally shared, salt did not
                        kill the trichinae, nor did the cooking except when the boiling of the meat
                        is carried to 70° centigrade. In short, he believed the danger arising from
                        the free admission of foreign pork was very great, and he thought it would
                        be very unwise not to regulate in some way its importation into France.</p>
                    <p>Finally, after a long debate, in which the same arguments were asserted and
                        reasserted in many shapes, the question came to a vote, and the order of the
                        day, proposed by Mr. Paul Bert, was carried by 272 votes against 153.</p>
                    <p>It is but simple justice to state that Mr. Herisson earnestly opposed every
                        effort of Mr. Paul Bert and of his associates in behalf of the French hog
                        raisers and packers. It is admitted openly that public health has little
                        bearing upon the subject in its present stage; it is simply now a question
                        of protection.</p>

                        <p>To comply with the vote of the Chamber it was decided yesterday in
                            cabinet council to prohibit the free importation of American pork until
                            parliamentary action is taken in the matter. In the mean time American
                            pork will be admitted at the ports of Havre, Bordeaux, and Nantes, where
                            an examination of the meat will take place under the control and at the
                            expense of the Chambers of Commerce of those places.</p>
                        <p>This measure is satisfactory to the French importers, but the
                            protectionists will probably oppose it, as many of the members of the
                            Chamber of Commerce are interested in making the inspection as easy as
                            possible. It is to be feared, therefore, that the propriety of this
                            measure will be questioned in the Chamber.</p>
                        <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0230"/>
                        <p>The department of commerce contemplates the introduction of a new bill
                            providing for a system of inspection.</p>
                        <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>The National of last night, speaking of this bill (the one recently
                            introduced into Congress for the purpose of empowering the President to
                            prohibit the importation of articles injurious to public health from
                            countries which on the same ground prohibit American products), says “it
                            was at first directed against Germany only; but that, in consequence of
                            the recent vote of the Chamber postponing the removal of the restriction
                            on American pork, France will now have to take her place by the side, of
                            Germany, and be equally made the victim of these reprisals. Owing to the
                            order of the day of Mr. Paul Bert, French products are going to be
                            driven out from America. It belongs to the Government to take steps as
                            early as possible to prevent an eventuality which would be so damaging
                            to French commerce.”</p>

                    <p>Dettmers stated, incorrectly, in 1878–1879, in report on swine plague, not
                        trichinae, that disease was very prevalent in West, and hogs laboring under
                        it were carelessly sent to market. He has since, in newspapers, expressed
                        erroneous views on swine disease generally in the West. Curtis, a thorough
                        expert, who is investigating trichinosis, reports to Agricultural Department
                        that there is very little disease of any kind; that Dettmers is mistaken;
                        that great care is taken by breeders and packers to send healthy pork to
                        market. Commissioner Agriculture entirely accepts Curtis’s statement. At
                        meeting Swine Breeders’ Association unanimously stated no disease whatever
                        had occurred among swine in Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, and

                                serious blow to the provision inter-tests of the whole country as
                                well as those of the farmers of the Northwest.</p>
                            <p>Understanding that the French Government is favorable to the
                                withdrawal of the prohibitory decree, and believing that Congress
                                when reassembled will define a retaliatory policy, we ask that you
                                will instruct our minister to France to work with utmost energy, to
                                bring about repeal of decree, intimating, if you think proper, that
                                such action by Congress is probable. This we know would be of
                                greatest value and would undoubtedly produce most favorable
                                results.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 26th ultimo (dispatch 464), I informed
                        the Department of the resolution voted by the Chamber of Deputies, a few
                        days before, expressing the desire that the free admission of American pork
                        be again suspended, and of the action the Government felt compelled to take
                        in consequence of this vote.</p>
                    <p>When my dispatch was forwarded (Friday, the 28th), I had not seen the text of
                        the new prohibitory decree, which was only issued on the following day, but
                        my telegram of the same evening, of which a copy is herewith inclosed, gave
                        you its substance. I have the honor of sending to-day a copy and translation
                        of the decree, and of a report of the minister of commerce to the President,
                        explaining his motives.</p>
                    <p>At the President’s reception on New Year’s day I had occasion of recurring
                        again to this subject with the president of the council and the minister of
                        commerce, and I am glad to say that both seem as desirous as I am of
                        securing the permanent removal of any obstruction to the <pb n="133"
                            xml:id="pg_133" facs="0233"/>importation in France of American pork. I
                        remarked to Mr. Ferry that I had not failed to inform you of his sincere
                        desire to comply with my requests in the matter, and that I was in receipt
                        of a dispatch expressing your appreciation of his friendly language and
                        course, and instructing me to convey to him the satisfaction felt by the
                        Government of the United States with his action, which I intended to do in a
                        more formal manner. “This action of ours,” said Mr. Ferry, “is not over; we
                        do not intend to leave the matter as it now stands; we are collecting facts
                        and scientific opinions which are of such weight that they cannot fail to
                        impress favorably the Chamber.” Mr. Herisson confirmed this statement.</p>
                    <p>It cannot be doubted that there exists in the public mind a strong-prejudice
                        against American pork, a prejudice which has been unfortunately to some
                        extent created or aggravated by certain American newspaper articles of which
                        the French protectionists adroitly took advantage. It was in reference to a
                        statement made upon the authority of an American scientist that I
                        telegraphed you to ascertain the correctness of those attributed to Dr.
                        Dettmar. Your answer furnished me with valuable information, the insertion
                        of which I procured in all the leading French as well as in other
                        papers.</p>
                    <p>Your cipher dispatch of the 27th ultimo, expressing your satisfaction with my
                        diligence in the matter, and the hope that energetic efforts would be
                        continued to secure the permanent repeal of the prohibition, was duly
                        received. I highly appreciate the expression of approval, and shall spare no
                        exertion to second your efforts in this matter so important to our
                        commerce.</p>
                    <p>I have the honor to inclose herewith copies of a note addressed to Mr. Ferry,
                        on the 2d instant, of the telegrams above mentioned, and of the one given to
                        the press.</p>

                                        of Havre, Bordeaux, and Marseilles, and upon the condition
                                        that it shall be stated that it answers to the description
                                        known in commerce under the name of “<hi rend="italic">fully

                                        may entail.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur le President</hi>: On the 27th November
                            last I had the honor to submit for your signature a decree repealing
                            that of the 18th February, 1881, which prohibited on the territory of
                            the Republic the importation of salted pork coming from the United
                            States. This measure was grounded upon the opinion of the Academy of
                            Medicine and upon the decision of the consultative committee of public
                            health of France, specially appointed to deliberate upon the matter.</p>
                        <p>The Chamber of Deputies, at its sitting on the 22d December, evinced the
                            desire that the execution of the decree of the 27th November should be
                            postponed until the discussion of a proposed law, of which it has
                            already had notice.</p>
                        <p>The object of the decree annexed herewith is to satisfy this desire in
                            suspending the importation of American pork.</p>
                        <p>In order, however, to avoid confusion in commercial transactions, I have
                            the honor to submit likewise for your high approbation a temporary
                            measure with the view of conciliating the various interests
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>It is as well to recall in this connection that when the decree of the
                            18th of February, 1881, had for the first time edicted the formal
                            prohibition of American pork, the importation of the said meat was none
                            the less, in consequence of the importance of the operations engaged,
                            authorized until May 20 of the same year, under the reserve of a
                            microscopical examination.</p>
                        <p>The measure which I propose to you has been inspired by this
                            precedent.</p>
                        <p>The meat can exceptionally enter France until January 20 next by the
                            three ports of Havre, Bordeaux, and Marseilles, and under certain,
                            conditions to prove its harmlessness.</p>
                        <p>This very short period is proof that the measure of favor can only be
                            really applied to goods at the present time in transit or for which
                            engagements have been made.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the guarantees required for the public health, I
                            thought I could do no better to do away with all fears than reproduce
                            textually in the decree those which appear in the proposed law voted by
                            the Chamber on the 28th March, 1882, and which has just been taken up
                            again an supported before the same assembly by those of its members who
                            have evinced the least desire for free importation.</p>
                        <p>It should be stated that the meat answers to the description known in
                            commerce under the name of “<hi rend="italic">fully cured</hi>”; that it
                            is healthy, in a perfect state of preservation, and that the curing is
                            complete.</p>
                        <p>The statements should be made by expert agents, appointed by the
                            prefects, and the importers should declare, before any discharge, that
                            they consent to pay the cost that may be incurred by the inspection.</p>
                        <p>If the advantages of the decree, which I have the honor to propose to
                            you, appear to you of such, a nature as to advise its adoption, I beg
                            you, M. le President, to be so good as to affix your signature
                            thereto.</p>

                        <p>At the New Year’s reception, at the Elysée, I intimated to you that I was
                            in receipt of a dispatch from Mr. Frelinghuysen, in which he requested
                            me to express to you his appreciation of your course in the matter,
                            which I now take pleasure in doing more fully than I could
                            yesterday.</p>
                        <p>“I have to request you,” says Mr. Frelinghuysen, “to convey to the

                            satisfaction which the liberal and enlightened course of the French
                            authorities in reference to this matter, based upon thorough scientific
                            investigation, has afforded this Government.”</p>
                        <p>It is the hope of my Government, and my own, that this liberal action of

                        <p>We have received the following dispatch:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Washington</hi>, <hi rend="italic">December</hi> 30,
                            1883.—The Secretary of State has telegraphed to the American minister at
                            Paris, that a competent expert, Mr. Curtis, appointed by the Department
                            of Agriculture to make an investigation as to trichinosis, reports
                            officially that no disease exists among American hogs.</p>
                        <p>At a meeting of the Association of Western Swine-breeders it was
                            unanimously resolved that in the five great producing States, Ohio,
                            Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin, no disease whatever existed
                            among swine.</p>
                        <p>The discrimination of the French authorities against American pork is,
                            therefore, made directly in the face of the evidence. A competent
                            expert, appointed by the United States Government, reports that the
                            disease, against which the prohibitive French legislation was directed,
                            does not exist. As the object of such legislation is not to prohibit the
                            pork itself, there appears to be, under the circumstances, no good
                            reason for its continued existence.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I inclose herewith for your information copies
                        of certain papers which have been filed in this Department in regard to the
                        case of Alfred P. Jacob, of Philadelphia, Pa., who claims exemption from the
                        performance of military duty in France upon the ground that he is an
                        American citizen. It appears from these papers the father was naturalized
                        during the son’s minority. This made the son an American citizen without
                        regard to place of birth. His American birth at Philadelphia is not
                        pertinent, it being asserted that his father registered him in the French
                        consulate as a Frenchman, and so his case may be considered precisely as
                        though he had been brought to this country while a minor. But this gave no
                        claim to military service. He was only 17 when his father’s act made him an
                        American citizen. He had never been within French jurisdiction. He could not
                        therefore be a <hi rend="italic">deserter</hi>. The United States passport
                        given to him should have protected him. That was <hi rend="italic">prima
                            facie</hi> evidence of his right as an American citizen by our law,
                        which France cannot disregard. The French Code says that all Frenchmen who
                        become citizens of another country <hi rend="italic">by the laws
                            thereof</hi> lose French citizenship thereby. Had this want of respect
                        to an American passport been brought to our attention at the time, this
                        Government would have urgently protested. This does not appear to have been
                        done. Young Jacob seems to have acquiesced and served his term. This
                        personal acquiescence may possibly vitiate his right to relief or indemnity
                        for the past, but it does not destroy the right of this Government to feel
                        itself aggrieved (if the facts are found to be as stated) that a United
                        States passport should have been disregarded. The least that France can do
                        is to recognize that Jacob became a citizen by due operation of law, and
                        strike his name off the roll.</p>
                    <p>You will therefore bring this matter to the attention of the foreign office
                        with a view to having such action taken in the premises as may appear
                        proper, upon full inquiry into all the facts of the case.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Having been born in Philadelphia July 10,
                            1858, of French parents, and having lived and pursued my studies in said
                            city till the age of 19, I have always considered myself an American
                            citizen.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, after graduating at the Polytechnic College I went abroad
                            with my family to remain a few years. I was drafted and incorporated in
                            the French army against my will and right, as my father had been
                            naturalized while I was under age and had voted.</p>
                        <p>I called on the American legation at Paris, but they were unable to clear
                            the case owing to the fact that I had been registered at my birth at the
                            office of the French consul at Philadelphia.</p>
                        <p>My papers and those of my father were presented to the French Government
                            by the American minister, together with a written protestation signed by
                            me and approved by the legation.</p>
                        <p>All this being of no avail, I submitted and was obliged, under pain of
                            being considered a deserter, to serve for a period of four years in the
                            army, never giving up the desire, however, of retaining my American
                            citizenship.</p>
                        <p>Being now relieved of the French service I have returned to my native
                            country, and I appeal to you to please take such measures as you may
                            think proper to have my name marked off from the French roll, for, being
                            a citizen of the United States, I wish to be able to travel as such on
                            the continent without further trouble about the French army.</p>
                        <p>Inclosed you will find all my papers in testimony of the above
                            statements, and I will be much obliged to you to return same.</p>
                        <p>Hoping you will consider my claims, and answer favorably,</p>
                        <p>I remain, &amp;c.,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: By special appointment I called yesterday on
                        Mr. Ferry to ascertain his intentions in relation to the earnest
                        representations I had again made with reference to the prohibition of our
                        pork products and to call his serious attention to the agitation which the
                        revival of prohibitory measures had created in the United States. I reminded
                        him of his promise made on New Year’s day that he would not let the matter
                        rest there, adding that I had communicated to you his language, that the
                        moment was critical, and that if some liberal steps were not determined upon
                        on this side, Congress would no doubt adopt measures which might complicate
                        the matter and render its solution less easy.</p>
                    <p>He said he remembered well his promise, and reasserted that his Government
                        did not intend to let the matter drop, that the minister of commerce was
                        preparing a bill which he hoped would give satisfaction to both countries,
                        but that he had not pressed its presentation in order to enable public
                        opinion to be enlightened as to the true bearing of the question; that the
                        press had so widely and so liberally discussed it that he expected to find
                        less opposition in the Chambers when the question was again brought before
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Upon my inquiring the nature of the contemplated bill, he said that it would
                        provide for an inspection, but it was the intention of the Government <pb
                            n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0237"/>to make this inspection as light as
                        possible, its object being mainly to show whether the meats were or were not
                            <hi rend="italic">fully cured</hi>, for the purpose of only rejecting
                        the latter. In substance the bill is to be the: same as the one which passed
                        the Chamber in March, 1882, the more liberal conditions of which are
                        embodied in the Gaudin bill, which caused the introduction of Mr. Paul
                        Bert’s resolution, and which is now in the hands of a committee of the
                        house.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ferry then asked if I could give him any definite information as to the
                        character of the measures recently introduced in Congress in relation to the
                        subject; what he desired particularly to know was what share our Government
                        had in the action thus taken, and if any of the bills or measures mentioned
                        by telegrams had official character.</p>
                    <p>I replied that though I had not received any communication from you with
                        reference to the matter, I could safely give him the assurance that you had
                        not proposed any of the measures to which he referred, as in our system of
                        Government the Executive did not originate legislation, that these measures
                        had been undoubtedly proposed by members of the two houses, under the
                        pressure of public opinion, or at the suggestion of the large and
                        influential class of people engaged in the pork trade, and that I had good
                        reason to believe that very far from countenancing any unreasonable
                        retaliatory measures you disapproved of them. I then gave him the substance
                        of a late telegram published in the London Times, stating that you had
                        intimated to members of the House of Representatives that it would be well
                        to proceed with circumspection in the matter of authorizing the prohibition
                        of the importation of certain goods from foreign countries which placed
                        restrictions on the importation of American products; that the introduction
                        in Congress of certain measures had already accomplished some good, and that
                        it would perhaps be better to avoid actual legislation of a retaliatory
                        character.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ferry was much pleased with this statement. “These are,” he said, “very
                        good words; they convey wise advice and are calculated to facilitate us
                        [meaning himself and myself] in the task we have jointly undertaken of
                        settling this troublesome question.”</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>In the course of the conversation reference was also made to the
                        establishment of a system of inspection of our salted meats by United States
                        officers, and Mr. Ferry expressed the opinion that an inspection having this
                        character would be received here with great satisfaction and might remove
                        all the objections made by many people who still believed in trichinae and
                        trichinosis, and he was pleased to say that he was not one of them.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: My telegram of yesterday gave you the
                        substance of the conversation I had in the morning with Mr. Paul Bert in
                        view of his opposition to the free admission of our salted meats. Although I
                        had often met Mr. Paul Bert in official circles and at my house, I felt some
                        hesitancy in approaching, on this subject, an expert with whom I could not
                        attempt to discuss the matter scientifically, and one who had taken in this
                        instance a hostile stand to his own Government. I thought proper to first
                        suggest the idea to the president of the council, who favored the suggestion
                        and even advised me to see Mr. Paul Bert, and appeared as anxious as I am to
                        reach a practical understanding with regard to this difficulty.</p>
                    <p>I opened the subject with Mr. Paul Bert by stating very frankly that I had
                        not called to enter upon a technical controversy with so distinguished a
                        scientist with reference to the question of trichinosis, but simply as an
                        American as friendly to France as I knew he was to America, and to express
                        the hope that a man of his liberal views could devise some plan of action
                        which would give satisfaction to both countries. I added that the matter had
                        taken a threatening aspect in the United States, that our people could not
                        understand why American pork should be prohibited in France while similar
                        products were admitted from all other countries; that my Government and
                        people had become impatient after waiting so long for a settlement always
                        promised but never reached, and that the American Congress would move in the
                        matter unless action was taken by the French Government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Paul Bert said he was very glad I had presented the case so frankly and
                        on broad grounds, and asked permission to state as frankly his position.</p>
                    <p>In the first place he was not a protectionist, his political principles led
                        him to favor competition, and upon that ground he would open all the French
                        ports to our hog products.</p>
                    <p>In the second place, he did not believe in any of the absurd notions
                        entertained by so many people in relation to trichinae and trichinosis. He
                        knew that dead trichinae did not injure the meat; he knew that a <hi
                            rend="italic">certain</hi> amount of salt killed it; he knew that a <hi
                            rend="italic">certain</hi> degree of cooking destroyed it, and he knew
                        that there were no epidemics of trichinosis in the United States, where the
                        consumption of pork was larger than in any other country; but he also knew
                        that live trichinae existed in American pork, for he had seen some, and that
                        neither the salting nor the cooking <hi rend="italic">always</hi> killed. If
                        trichinosis was a malady affecting only individuals, he would not notice it.
                        Some people would take it, some would die, others would recover, but
                        trichinosis when once introduced in a country might become epidemic, and
                        this was what he wanted to guard against. American and German pork were
                        infected with trichinae, French pork was not. His only aim was to guard
                        French pork in this respect. The true and proper mode of reaching this end
                        would be to determine by scientific experiments the exact proportion of salt
                        necessary to kill trichinae, and the exact length of time during which the
                        meat is to remain in the brine, but this cannot be done in a few weeks, and
                        not even in a few months. Inspection is, therefore, the <pb n="139"
                            xml:id="pg_139" facs="0239"/>only remedy available. But inspection on
                        this side, is attended with insuperable difficulties, because to be
                        effective it must apply to every piece of meat. Now on the other side this
                        difficulty does not exist, because if trichinæ is not found in certain well
                        known parts of a whole hog, the animal is free from it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Paul Bert dwelt at length upon this subject in a scientific manner, which
                        I regret I cannot explain with his accuracy, but which struck me as having
                        force. He assured me that he was moved purely by scientific consideration 5
                        that very far from having any intention of obstructing our commercial
                        relations, he was desirous of increasing them in every way, and that he had
                        not the slightest concern with the French packers. He promised to take up
                        the matter earnestly and to spare no effort to devise some plan which would
                        be acceptable to us but repeated that in his opinion an American inspection
                        would solve the difficulty much more easily than a French inspection. He was
                        very careful, however, in pointing out that he meant a Government
                        inspection, made by <hi rend="italic">national officials</hi> under the
                        supervision of the authorities at Washington, and not a local inspection
                        made by State or city officers, in whom he would have no more confidence
                        than in officials of the same kind appointed by the local authorities of
                        France.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Paul Bert is to dine with me to-morrow with the president of the council
                        and other members of the cabinet, and I may have something more to report in
                        relation to this subject by the next mail.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of
                        your dispatch No. 436, of January 21, 1884, regarding Alfred P. Jacob, who
                        was drafted into the French military service, although he was born in the
                        United States, his father, a native of France, having acquired American
                        citizenship before the son was of age. I am instructed to bring the matter
                        to the attention of the French foreign office, with a view of obtaining at
                        least Jacob’s recognition as an American citizen.</p>
                    <p>As the instructions of the Department are contingent upon the results of a
                        full inquiry into all the facts of the case, I venture to submit the
                        following remarks before taking any action in the matter:</p>
                    <p>When Mr. Jacob, senior, applied to this legation in 1879—Alfred P. Jacob’s
                        application, if made, is not recalled—he was informed that the case of his
                        son was a clear one, but that there was only one safe way of proceeding to
                        establish his rights. In the first place, he was to refuse military service,
                        upon the ground that he was not a Frenchman. To this plea it was expected
                        the military authorities would answer that they were not competent to pass
                        upon a question of naturalization, but they would suspend action until Jacob
                        could have the question decided by a civil court. He was then to apply to
                        such a court and produce in evidence of his statement the papers with which
                        he was possessed—passport, his father’s certificate of naturalization,
                        certificate of baptism, with an additional certificate given by the
                        legation. The court <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0240"/>would examine
                        these papers, and, if found genuine, would render a judgment declaring that
                        the applicant was not a Frenchman.</p>
                    <p>It is only upon the production of such judgment that the French military
                        authorities can strike off a name inscribed on the roll by authority of law.
                        They have no discretion in the matter, nor has the Government itself. Mr.
                        Jacob was informed of this, as are all others similarly situated. He did
                        not, however, follow the course recommended, and insisted upon having his
                        case submitted to the French Government. It was, but without the slightest
                        hope of obtaining a favorable result. General Noyes called in person on Mr.
                        Waddington, then minister of foreign affairs, explained to him the ease and
                        handed him, with warm recommendation, a petition drawn up and signed by
                        Jacob’s father.</p>
                    <p>The answer was exactly the one expected. The minister stated substantially
                        that Jacob, being born before his father had been naturalized, was, in the
                        eye of French law, a French citizen; that the minister of war had no
                        authority to dispense with a service imposed on every Frenchman, and that,
                        if he disclaimed French citizenship, it belonged only to the courts to pass
                        upon the question.</p>
                    <p>There was no other recourse open to Mr. Jacob but the one which had been
                        pointed out to him. He let the matter drop, his son was drafted and served
                        without protest in the French army.</p>
                    <p>In presence of these facts I respectfully submit to the Department whether
                        there is still occasion for making the application. I am directed to make an
                        application which would undoubtedly bring the answer that Mr. Jacob must
                        apply to a court of justice if he wants to correct his personal legal status
                        as it now stands in France.</p>
                    <p>In stating this case, the Department refers to the article of the French Code
                        which says that French citizenship is lost by acquiring other citizenship
                        (art. 17). The reference is correct, but the article quoted is to be
                        completed by article 1 of the Decree of 1811—which is law—stating that no
                        Frenchman can be naturalized in a foreign country without the authorization
                        of the Government. The French Government strictly adheres to this principle;
                        but the <hi rend="italic">courts of justice</hi> have very generally held
                        that foreign citizenship acquired legally abroad is valid. There is no case
                        on record at this legation of a Frenchman naturalized in the United States
                        whose American citizenship was not recognized by the French courts of
                        justice, on the ground that it was acquired without the consent of the
                        French Government. But this article of the Code Napoleon has no bearing upon
                        the case of Jacob. The article applicable in this instance is the tenth,
                        which says that any child born of a Frenchman in a foreign country is
                        French. Jacob’s father was a Frenchman at the time of the birth of the son;
                        the son is therefore a Frenchman in the eye of the French law, until a
                        competent tribunal decides that he has renounced his national citizenship
                        and acquired another one.</p>
                    <p>In this respect the French law, which is only an application of the principle
                        common to all Latin races, that natural citizenship is a kind of nobility
                        transmitted with the blood, stands in direct contradiction with the English
                        and American principle, according to which citizenship is a fact primarily
                        determined by the place of birth. This is one of the numerous conflicts of
                        laws existing in the legislation of friendly countries, which are tolerated
                        from comity and for which there is no other remedy than by special treaty.
                        France and Switzerland recently recurred to this process for the settlement
                        of conflicts of this very nature.</p>
                    <p>Awaiting further instructions in this matter, I inclose herewith copy and
                        translation of Mr. Waddington’s note to General Noyes, and copy of the
                        certificate furnished to Mr. Jacob.</p>
                    <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0241"/>
                    <p>I may add that this case was not reported at the time to the Department, as
                        it presented no peculiar feature, the ruling of the French Government being
                        in this instance what it has always been in every similar case.</p>

                            recruitment lists in France. The personal status of this young man, who
                            was born at Philadelphia in 1858, before his father had obtained
                            American naturalization, has not, according to French jurisprudence,
                            been modified by the change of his father’s nationality. The minister of
                            war finds it, therefore, impossible to withdraw him from the military

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to send herewith copy and
                        translation of a bill published in the <hi rend="italic">Journal
                            Officiel</hi> of this morning in relation to the introduction into
                        France of all salted, smoked, or preserved pork of foreign origin.</p>
                    <p>This bill, which was introduced by the minister of commerce, Mr. Herisson,
                        and the minister of finances, Mr. Tirard, allows the importation of salted
                        pork in France, through certain ports which are to be designated hereafter,
                        provided said pork is fully cured, which is to be established by an
                        inspection made by experts appointed by the local authorities and paid for
                        by the importers at the rate of five cents per box or barrel, or three cents
                        per piece of meat when not imported in boxes or in barrels.</p>
                    <p>The bill is prefixed with a long explanation (<hi rend="italic">exposé des
                            motifs</hi>), in which the Government states that it was upon the advice
                        in favor of free importation, given by both the Academy of Medicine and the
                        committee of public hygiene, that the President had canceled the decree of
                        prohibition, and that it was reissued only to comply with the desire
                        expressed by the Chamber in its sitting of December 22d, 1883. The present
                        state of things, however, has given rise to many complaints and
                        inconveniences. The French minister at Washington has made known that
                        retaliatory measures applicable to French wines had been introduced in
                        Congress, and French chambers of commerce have remonstrated against the
                        continuance of a measure which might have such an unpleasant result. The
                        Government therefore, being-desirous of showing that it had no intention of
                        prohibiting altogether these meats, and feeling convinced that the Chamber
                        had no such intention, has come to the conclusion that an inspection,
                        establishing that the meats imported in France are <hi rend="italic">fully
                            cured</hi> (that it is very carefully prepared, well preserved, and
                        healthy), would be satisfactory to the Chamber.</p>
                    <p>A bill providing for such inspection is therefore submitted, with the
                        expression of the desire of the Government that it will be acted upon as
                        soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">exposé</hi> winds up with the following paragraphs:
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The question thus put is one the solution of which ought not to be
                                delayed. From the moment the public health is assured, no reason any
                                longer exists to deprive the population of an alimentary substance
                                to which they had become used.</p>
                            <p>It is equally important to give to the United States a proof of our
                                firm intention to favor exchange between the two countries. Already,
                                upon the announcement that acceptable dispositions would not fail to
                                regulate the importation of salted meats, a communication tending to
                                the reduction of duties established in the United States upon works
                                of art has been transmitted to Congress and recommended to their
                                attention. There is no doubt, also, that the velleities of
                                prohibition of our wines and liquors would fall through if the
                                dispositions in question were put into execution.</p>
                            <p>We will add that the Government of the United States appears on their
                                side disposed to take measures with a view to assure the good state
                                of preparation of exported meats, and they announce their intention
                                to establish at the ports of shipment a special service of
                                inspection.</p>

                                scientific standing, who agree in stating that, no case of
                                trichinosis having been detected in France and in England, the
                                importation of American salted pork can be authorized in
                                France.</item>
                            <item>Second, a report on the same matter by Dr. Colin d’Alfort and the
                                debate of the Academy pursuant to these reports, which debate ended
                                by the adoption, without opposition, of the conclusion recommended
                                by Dr. Proust and his commission.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>The matter was brought yesterday before a committee of the House, which seems
                        to favor the proposition of the Government. A paper states this morning that
                        Mr. Paul Bert has also accepted the proposition, but expressed the opinion
                        that the Government should inquire “as to the practicability of concluding a
                        diplomatic convention with the United States for facilitating the inspection
                        of salt meats in America before shipment.” Mr. Bert believed that “American
                        inspectors might act in accord with the French consuls in America, and after
                        inspection give certificates as to the soundness of each cargo, which would
                        obviate the necessity of renewed inspection on arrival in France.”</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to your dispatch No. 494, of
                        the 5th ultimo, in which you make a full statement of the facts relating to
                        the case of Alfred P. Jacob, I have to say that the previous instruction was
                        based on the absence of any report from the legation in the premises and the
                        assumption that Mr. Jacob had voluntarily submitted to serve in the army
                        without recourse to diplomatic protection. His case now, as it stands, is
                        peculiar. By our laws he is an American citizen, his status as such dating
                        from his father’s naturalization.</p>
                    <p>By French law he is a recognized citizen through service in the army, which
                        only a citizen can perform. That obligation to do military duty (whether
                        rightly due or not) having been extinguished, no precise issue remains on
                        which the status of Mr. Jacob could be carried before a court. To make the
                        issue, the only available way would seem to be to present the case and ask
                        that his name be stricken off. With this explanation you may make the
                        request contemplated in our No. 436.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I transmit herewith a copy of a sworn
                        statement of Mr. John B. Foichat, a citizen of the United States, who has
                        been for the last nine years a resident of the State of Indiana, also a
                        statement of several distinguished citizens of that state who are his
                        neighbors, who vouch for his good character and standing. The facts upon
                        which Mr. Foichat’s claim rests, as you will perceive from a perusal of the
                        memorial, and which for your greater convenience I condense, appear to be
                        these, namely:</p>
                    <p>John B. Foichat, the claimant, was born in Bordeaux, France, on the 4th of
                        January 1853; in 1870, when 17 years of age, he came to the United States,
                        and has ever since resided in the State of Indiana. In May, 1883, he was
                        regularly admitted to citizenship of the United States by the circuit court
                        of the State of Indiana for Parke County. In August, 1883, he obtained a
                        passport from this Department with a view of revisiting his native town and
                        his relations there, and arrived in Bordeaux in September, 1883. On the 22d
                        of November following he was arrested on the charge of having failed, when
                        he attained the age of 21 years, to report for military service. He
                        exhibited his passport and certificate of naturalization and demanded to be
                        released and allowed to proceed on his way. These papers, together with his
                        private papers, were seized and retained by the officers, and he was kept in
                        the military prison at Chamberry two days and three nights; he was then
                        handcuffed and taken to the military prison at Grenoble to be tried by
                        court-martial; then he was imprisoned in a cell and his valuables all taken
                            <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146" facs="0246"/>from him. He was detained at
                        Grenoble four days. His case at last reached the ear of B. F. Peixotto,
                        esq., United States consul at Lyons, and through the efforts of that officer
                        Foichat was released on the ground of his American citizenship.</p>
                    <p>There appears to be no reason for doubting the correctness of the claimant’s
                        statement. These, however, you will be able to satisfy yourself about by
                        inquiry of the United States consul at Lyons, and if you find them
                        substantially as stated, you will, I have no doubt, concur in the view
                        entertained by the Department, that aside from the mere personal
                        inconvenience and expense to which the claimant was subjected, the
                        transaction involved an unwarranted and seemingly unnecessary indignity
                        offered to a citizen of the United States which this Government cannot
                        suffer to pass unnoticed. You will, under the conditions stated, <hi
                            rend="italic">i. e.</hi>, the facts found upon inquiry to be true,
                        present the claim to the minister of state for foreign affairs with the
                        earnest request on the part of this Government that the subject may receive
                        from that of France early and just consideration, and that a reasonable
                        pecuniary indemnity will be awarded and paid on behalf of Mr. Foichat. I do
                        not allow myself to doubt but that the justice of the claim will be at once
                        recognized by the French Government, animated, as that Government is, by the
                        highest sentiments of liberality and fairness.</p>
                    <p>You will report the result of your proceedings in the matter to the
                        Department.</p>

                            from the statement made by Mr. Foichat that his rights as an American

                            said town of Bordeaux and his said relatives; that being there for such
                            purpose and none other and conducting himself lawfully and peacefully,
                            he was, without cause, on the 22d day of November, 1883, at said town,
                            arrested, by certain officers in the service of said Government of
                            France, for the alleged reason of his failing to respond, when he came
                            21 years of age, to a demand of said Government to do military duty as
                            required by said Government of her subjects. Affiant says that at said
                            time, to wit, on the said 22d day of December, 1883, he made exhibit to
                            said officers of his said passport and naturalization papers, and
                            demanded to be passed, respected, and protected as a citizen of the
                            United States, but that said officers did not respect his rights as such
                            citizen, but, upon the contrary, and notwithstanding such demand and
                            papers and passport, maintained said arrest and retained said passport
                            and papers and thrust him in the military prison at Chamberry, in said
                            department; that he was required to remain in said prison for a period
                            of two days and three nights; that thereupon certain other officers of
                            said Government put hand-cuffs upon affiant and took him to the military
                            prison at Grenoble, in France, for the purpose of being court-martialed
                            upon said charge of failing to respond for military duty as aforesaid;
                            that thereupon they took from affiant all articles of value and then
                            incarcerated him in a cell in said prison and kept him there for a
                            period of four days upon coarse prison fare, and was not allowed to
                            purchase any article of food such as he desired, but such request was
                            denied; that thereupon he was released through the interposition of the
                            consul of said United States at Lyons, to wit, Hon. B. F. Peixotto,
                            consul at said place, upon the ground and for the reason that affiant
                            was at the time of said arrest and imprisonment a citizen of said United
                            States, as aforesaid; that during said imprisonment last mentioned he
                            was allowed no reasonable time to communicate with said consul as to his
                            release, but such privilege was delayed as long as possible; that no
                            proper effort was made by said officers or other proper authorities of
                            said Government of France to investigate said facts touching his said
                            citizenship, and that they utterly failed to respect said papers and
                            passport as they of right should have done.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore affiant says that his rights and dignity as an American citizen
                            was disregarded and insulted by said Government of France by Reason of
                            the acts in the premises, and he humbly appeals to his Government and
                            prays that such steps may be taken in the premises as will best cause
                            due reparation be made by said Government of France for her acts above
                            stated, to the end that the citizenship of affiant be respected and
                            upheld, and for the dignity and protection of American citizenship in
                            the future.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose herewith copy of a
                        note dated April 7, which, agreeably to your instructions, I address to Mr.
                        Jules Ferry in relation to the case of Alfred Jacob, an American citizen by
                        birth, but considered by France as French, with a copy of the reply of the
                        minister of foreign affairs thereto, and a translation of the same.</p>
                    <p>The circumstances of this case, briefly recalled, are as follows:</p>
                    <p>Alfred Jacob was born in the United States. His father was a Frenchman, who
                        became naturalized long after the birth of his son. Jacob, jr., having gone
                        to France, was called upon to perform military service on the ground that
                        being the son of a Frenchman he was French notwithstanding his foreign
                        birth. He protested, declaring that he was an American citizen, but this
                        protest was not accepted, the French Government stating that it had no
                        authority in the matter, as all questions involving citizenship were to be
                        determined in France by courts of justice. Jacob was thereupon advised to
                        submit his case to a French civil tribunal, which he declined to do, and
                        served in the French army. After having been honorably discharged, he
                        returned to his American home and appealed to the United States Government
                        with the view of securing the erasure of his name from the French military
                        rolls, and the recognition of his American citizenship.</p>
                    <p>Your dispatch No. 436, of January 21, 1884, instructed me to make the desired
                        application should the facts, as stated by Jacob, be found correct.</p>
                    <p>I have found them correct in the main, but before complying with the <pb
                            n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0249"/>instructions I deemed it proper to
                        call the attention of the Department to the principles of law which govern
                        the action of France in all cases of this kind, and intimated, in No. 494,
                        of the 5th of February, that in the actual state of French legislation the
                        application, if made, could not be granted.</p>
                    <p>Upon considering the peculiarities of the case and the hardship suffered by
                        Jacob, who, although of American birth, was compelled to serve four years in
                        a foreign army, the Department very properly thought that he had the right
                        to ask the interposition of his Government, and your dispatch No. 474, of
                        March 18, 1884, renewed the request contemplated in your No. 436.</p>
                    <p>It was made accordingly, but I regret to say with hardly any success. Mr.
                        Jules Ferry replies by reasserting the reasons already given by Mr.
                        Waddington in the note which is annexed to my No. 494, that the Government
                        is powerless in such matters, that it cannot change the nationality of one
                        who is French by law, and that now, as heretofore, Jacob has only two ways
                        of establishing legally in France his change of nationality: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>By applying directly to the French Government for the permission
                                provided by law to acquire another citizenship.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>To obtain from a court of justice a decision that he has lost his
                                French citizenship.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Mr. Jules Ferry adds, however, that in view of the fact that Jacob has
                        performed his active military service the minister of war would consent to
                        his change of nationality should he apply to the minister of justice for the
                        permission to do so.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In 1879, Alfred P. Jacob, born at
                            Philadelphia, July 10, 1858, of Peter Jacob, a native of France, who
                            became an American citizen on the 2d of December, 1874, applied to this
                            legation to obtain the erasure of his name from the French military
                            rolls. This request was presented by General Noyes to Mr. Waddington,
                            whose reply, dated April 9, 1879, stated substantially that the personal
                            status of Jacob had not been modified by the naturalization of his
                            father, and that if he, the son, had lost his French citizenship it was
                            for him to establish that fact before a French court of justice, which
                            alone had jurisdiction in the matter.</p>
                        <p>Jacob, being unable to apply to the courts, allowed himself to be drafted
                            into the French army, where he served four years, never giving up,
                            however, his desire and intention of retaining his original American
                            citizenship.</p>
                        <p>After having been honorably discharged he returned to his home in the
                            United States, and asks now that his American citizenship be recognized
                            by the French authorities, so that he may travel as such on the
                            Continent without being liable to be called upon for further service in
                            the French army.</p>
                        <p>In directing me to present this request to your excellency, my Government
                            has expressed some surprise that an American-born citizen who had never
                            resided in France, and who was possessed with an American passport,
                            should have been compelled, notwithstanding his protest, to serve in the
                            army of a foreign country.</p>
                        <p>My Government thinks as the obligation to perform military duty, whether
                            rightly due or not, is extinguished, it does not appear that the status
                            of Mr. Jacob can be carried before the courts, and that the only
                            available way of obtaining the result desired by Mr. Jacob is to present
                            the case and to ask that this American citizen he formally recognized as

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur</hi>: You were good enough to write to me
                            on the 7th of last month with the view of obtaining the erasure from the
                            lists of our army of Mr. Alfred Jacob, born at Philadelphia on the 10th
                            of July, 1858, son of Pierre Jacob, of French origin, naturalized a
                            citizen of the United States December 2, 1874.</p>
                        <p>One of your predecessors, General Noyes, had already made an application
                            to my department in 1879, on behalf of this young man, then serving in
                            the army, but the matter was not followed up as his alienage could not
                            be established.</p>
                        <p>The personal status of Alfred Jacob could not be considered, according to
                            our law, as having been modified by the change of nationality of his
                            father, which change occurred subsequent to his birth. The question
                            which arose was, besides, of the exclusive competence of the civil
                            tribunals to whom the interested party has not seen fit to apply.</p>
                        <p>At the present time Mr. Alfred Jacob has completed his term of active
                            service in our army, and he has retired to the United States. The
                            Government of the Union requests that he may be definitively erased from
                            the lists of our army, as a foreigner, in order that he may enter our
                            territory without having to fear that lie will be called upon for the
                            fulfillment of his military duties.</p>
                        <p>The minister of war, to whom I hastened to submit this application,
                            states in his reply that he finds, to his regret, that it is legally
                            impossible for him to comply with the wish of the American
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>According to the terms of article 10 of our Civil Code, Alfred Jacob is
                            French as having been born of a Frenchman in a foreign country.</p>
                        <p>The military administration is no more authorized to-day than it was five
                            years ago, in the absence of a contrary decision made by the civil
                            tribunals, alone competent to deal with questions of personal status, to
                            consider the applicant as having lost his French nationality, in
                            consequence of the naturalization of his father, which happened after
                            his birth.</p>
                        <p>Our legislation does not admit in fact, like that of the United States,
                            that the naturalization of the father applies to his children, born
                            before the naturalization, no one in France having the right, by his act
                            alone, to modify the status and qualifications of others.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Alfred Jacob is, then, French in our view, and he remains, in France,
                            submitted to the obligations of the reserve and territorial army set
                            forth by article 37 of the law of the 27th July, 1872; he could not be
                            erased from our lists, except under a judgment declaring him a
                            foreigner, or unless he became naturalized an American citizen after
                            having obtained permission to do so from the French Government, but as
                            he has finished his time of active service General Campenon would be
                            quite willing to give his support, by a favorable note, to the
                            application which the interested party would address, with that object,
                            to the minister of justice.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Frelinghuysen telegraphs Mr. Morton that it is understood that the French
                        postmaster-general has refused permission to the Commercial Cable Company to
                        land in France, except on condition that the French Government may purchase
                        on one year’s notice the Commercial cable line from Ireland to France. The
                        United States considers this condition a violation of the first clause of
                        conditions and agreement upon which the French Telegraphic Company of Paris
                        and New York were allowed to land their cable on the snores of the United
                        States in 1880. This says that the company is to receive no exclusive
                        concessions from the French Government which would exclude any American
                        cable <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0251"/>from landing on French
                        territory and connecting with the inland telegraphic system of France. If
                        France possesses a right to make conditions she would logically have the
                        right to exclude, which is held to be contrary to the above-mentioned
                        agreement. Mr. Morton is instructed accordingly to make proper
                        representations to Mr. Ferry.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. Morton, upon receiving your telegraphic
                        instruction to remonstrate against the qualified instruction given to the
                        Commercial Gable Company to land in France, as being in violation of the
                        agreement of 1879, called on Mr. Ferry, to whom he explained the grounds of
                        your formulating objection. With a view of precising the question, and of
                        recalling it distinctly to the president of the council, Mr. Morton
                        addressed to him the next day a written communication, stating again the
                        case as you understood it, and expressing the hope that our friendly
                        representation would be well received.</p>
                    <p>The reply of Mr. Ferry, dated the 12th, only came to hand on the 15th. It is
                        a mere summary of a note from the minister of posts and telegraphs, Mr.
                        Cochery, which he transmits at the same time.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cochery, in this note, touches points not directly at issue, but, with
                        reference to the main question, he confines himself to the statement that
                        the Commercial Cable Company, having no direct communication with France,
                        cannot be assimilated to the French company, and he dismisses the complaint
                        in relation to the right which the Government has reserved to withdraw the
                        privilege granted, upon giving one year’s notice, by simply asserting that
                        this is a “general police right which exists by right in all
                        concessions.”</p>
                    <p>With the object of not letting Mr. Ferry remain under the impression that so
                        unsatisfactory an answer to our reasonable complaint could be accepted, in
                        acknowledging the receipt of his communication I said that, having no
                        instruction to discuss this matter, I had referred it to you, but explained
                        at the same time my inability to conciliate the position taken by the
                        minister of posts and telegraphs with the plain terms of the agreement of
                        1879.</p>
                    <p>The minister of foreign affairs, in his summary of the note of Mr. Cochery,
                        states that the permission given to the Commercial Cable Company to lay a
                        cable across the channel is an exceptional favor which has not been granted
                        heretofore to any other company.</p>
                    <p>By a contract made in 1859 the French Government has ceded to the Submarine
                        Telegraph Company the monopoly of connecting by cable France with the
                        British Islands.</p>
                    <p>This monopoly, which expires in 1889, is subject, however, to one
                        exception—the French Government has reserved the right of authorizing the
                        establishment of one line connecting France with Ireland for the exclusive
                        purpose of transmitting dispatches to and from America. This right having
                        never been availed of, the French Government would have really conferred an
                        exceptional favor upon the Commercial Cable Company by transferring it to
                        that company. But this was not done, <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0252"
                        />and the Commercial Company had to purchase from the Submarine Telegraph
                        Company the privilege of laying the cable which will connect France with
                        Ireland, a privilege already conceded for a consideration to the French and
                        English lines. The exceptional favor granted to the Commercial Cable Company
                        consists, therefore, in consenting to make no objection if the Submarine
                        Telegraph Company is willing to make use of its monopoly to the advantage of
                        France.</p>
                    <p>The minister of foreign affairs states also that the privilege given to the
                        Commercial Cable Company is not limited to 1889, as that given to the other
                        companies. That is true; but its privilege can be suppressed at any time
                        upon one year’s notice being given.</p>
                    <p>Thus, while the English company secured a lease of twenty years and the
                        French company a lease of ten years when they were organized, the Commercial
                        Cable Company can never be sure of existing more than one year.</p>
                    <p>In both the French and American concessions the telegraphic rate is limited;’
                        but if the American company finds it Necessary to reduce its tariff in order
                        to compete with the other lines, it cannot raise it again without an
                        authorization of the Government, an authorization which may be withheld for
                        a certain time and which is not needed by the English company.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cochery in his note lays much stress upon the fact that the Commercial
                        cable touches Ireland before reaching the United States, a fact from which
                        he draws the inference that it does not thus connect directly the two
                        countries. Mr. Cochery himself seems to have been of a different opinion
                        when he drew up the conditions upon which the Commercial Cable Company was
                        to receive its privilege, for article 1 of these conditions states that the
                        company is authorized “to land upon a point to be determined a transatlantic
                        cable connecting <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> France with North America
                        by touching at an intermediary point in Ireland, and which is to be used
                        exclusively for the transmission of dispatches exchanged with America.”</p>
                    <p>I inclose herewith copy of the correspondence exchanged in relation to this
                        subject.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the conversation I had the
                            honor of having yesterday with your excellency in relation to the
                            objections my Government had to the conditional authorization granted to
                            the American Commercial Cable Company to land in France, I beg leave to
                            restate here, substantially, the grounds of my complaint.</p>
                        <p>My Government having granted to the French Telegraph Company permission
                            to land its cables on our shores, upon the condition that the same
                            privilege would be given to any American company applying for it, I
                            requested your excellency on the 3d of January last to give this
                            privilege to the Commercial Company, an American corporation which had
                            already obtained from my Government the necessary facilities. This
                            request was promptly complied with and my Government was no less prompt
                            in acknowledging this action of the French Republic.</p>
                        <p>It seems, however, that this permission is only a qualified one, as it is
                            understood that the Commercial Company is required to assent to terms by
                            which the part of their line running from France to Ireland may be
                            purchased on a year’s notice. If such is the case, my Government
                            considers this condition as ‘contrary to the first clause of the
                            agreement of 1880, upon which the French Telegraph Company was allowed
                            to land on the shores of the United States, which clause reads as
                            follows:</p>
                        <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0253"/>
                        <p>“That the company receive no exclusive concession from the Government of
                            France which would exclude any other line which might be formed in the
                            United States from a like privilege of landing on the shores of France
                            and connecting with the inland telegraphic system of that country.”</p>
                        <p>In instructing me to make proper representations to your excellency in
                            relation to this matter, Mr. Frelinghuysen says, very judiciously—</p>
                        <p>“If France has a right to affix conditions, she would logically have a
                            right to exclude, which is assuredly contrary to the spirit of the
                            agreement between the two countries.”</p>
                        <p>I may add that this agreement was also assented to by the French
                            Telegraph Company in a letter to the Secretary of State, dated February
                            9, 1880, and signed by Mr. Pouyer Quertier. I trust that your excellency
                            will readily acknowledge that these friendly representations are well
                            founded, and that the obnoxious condition above referred to will be
                            dispensed with. Although the Commercial Cable Company might accept the
                            condition indicated, the objection of my Government would nevertheless
                            remain, as it is not made in view of any particular interest, but is one
                            of principle intended to cover all cases.</p>

                        <p>The observations presented by the legation of the United States appear to
                            have been caused by a misunderstanding. It seems, therefore, necessary
                            to insist upon the difference of the situation which exists between the
                            new concession and the concessions previously accorded.</p>
                        <p>The latter, in fact, apply to cables connecting <hi rend="italic"
                                >directly</hi> France and North America, without touching the
                            territory of any other country in their course. It was upon these
                            conditions that the French company from Paris to New York was
                            established, which gave rise on the part of the Government of the United
                            States to the claim of reciprocity recalled by Mr. Morton.</p>
                        <p>The application of Messrs. Mackay and Bennett is presented under
                            altogether different conditions.</p>
                        <p>It has for object the establishment between France and Ireland of a cable
                            which will join at Valentia a transatlantic line, of which it will be
                            the tributary. The submarine conductor, commencing at Havre, will not,
                            therefore, constitute a direct communication <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154"
                                facs="0254"/>with America; it will simply be the means of forwarding
                            dispatches from the Contient to the principal cable terminating in
                            Ireland.</p>
                        <p>In consequence no assimilation can be established between this new
                            concession and that which has been accorded to the French company from
                            Paris to New York.</p>
                        <p>It was, besides, in consequence of the intervention of the minister of
                            the United States that no objections were raised when the grantees
                            indicated their intention of having a landing place in Ireland.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, for the concession of the cable between France and
                            Ireland, the French administration is far from being placed in the
                            identical conditions to those which apply to the transatlantic
                            cables.</p>
                        <p>In fact, article 3 of the convention, concluded on January 2, 1859, with
                            the Compagnie des Cables de la Manche, grantee of a privilege for the
                            establishment of the cable between France and Great Britain, stipulates
                            only that—</p>
                        <p>“The French Government reserves to itself the right to authorize, as it
                            may seem fit, the establishment of a telegraphic line commencing at any
                            point upon the coast of France and terminating directly on the coast of
                            Ireland, and intended exclusively for the transmission from or for
                            America by the transatlantic cable.”</p>
                        <p>As, therefore, it is not admissible that the administration will abandon
                            a unique right, the enjoyment of which it should reserve for its direct
                            necessities, it has only been enabled to grant the authority under a
                            reservation of an understanding between the grantee and the Compagnie
                            des Cables de la Manche.</p>
                        <p>It was then impossible for it to make a concession under identically the
                            same conditions as those of the other concessions.</p>
                        <p>Messrs. Mackay and Bennett perfectly understood this, and made no
                            difficulty in accepting, on the 1st of February last, the prepared
                            stipulations (<hi rend="italic">cahier des charges</hi>) for their
                            concession.</p>
                        <p>These stipulations contain a redemption clause destined to fix, if
                            necessary, the duration of the concession to the uniform stated period
                            for all the cables laid across the channel between France and England,
                            that is to say, to 1889.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, there was a question, for the same motive, of limiting to 1889
                            the concession granted to Messrs. Mackay and Bennett, and it was upon
                            the application of the grantees that the repurchase clause was
                            substituted for this provision of limitation.</p>
                        <p>It was under these conditions that an understanding was arrived at in the
                            month of March last, and it was not then the subject of any observation
                            on the part of the Government of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Since that time the grantees, having allowed the period for regulating
                            their concession to expire, have recently been obliged to apply for the
                            renewal thereof.</p>
                        <p>The same stipulations were presented to them. They then raised an
                            objection with reference to the right of repurchase. Upon their
                            application this clause was suppressed, and it was simply agreed to add
                            to the conditions the right to terminate the authorization granted by
                            the French Government upon giving notice a year in advance. This is the
                            indication of a general right of police which exists of full right in
                            every concession.</p>
                        <p>The legation of the United States appears, besides, to contest the right
                            of the French Government of imposing conditions for the concession of
                            the cable.</p>
                        <p>It is necessary, with reference to this subject, not to lose sight of the
                            difference which exists between the conditions of organization of the
                            telegraphic service in France and in America.</p>
                        <p>In France the telegraph is submitted in an absolute manner to the
                            monopoly of the state.</p>
                        <p>In the United States it is freely worked by private industry.</p>
                        <p>It is clear, then, that, in the latter country it is possible to
                            authorize the establishment of submarine cables without conditions, but
                            it cannot be the same in France, where this manner of proceeding would
                            constitute an infringement upon the monopoly of the state.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your excellency’s note of the 12th instant, transmitting a
                            communication from Mr. Cochery, in reply to the friendly representations
                            Mr. Morton was instructed to make in relation to the qualified
                            authorization given to the Commercial Cable Company to land upon the
                            shores of France.</p>
                        <p>The objections of the United States Government to the conditions affixed
                            to the permission received by the American Cable Company are of the
                            simplest kind.</p>
                        <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0255"/>
                        <p>In 1879, my Government gave to the French company the right to land in
                            the United States, upon the distinct understanding and formal agreement
                            that the same privilege would be extended by France to any American
                            company which might apply for it. By its letter, as well as by its
                            spirit, this agreement means reciprocity of treatment for the companies
                            of both nations.</p>
                        <p>In 1884, the United States applies, in behalf of the American Commercial
                            Company, for the privilege to land in France, and obtains it only upon
                            terms less favorable than those made to the French company and with the
                            conditions that the privilege thus granted can be withdrawn upon giving
                            one year’s notice.</p>
                        <p>No such conditions haying been imposed upon the French company in the
                            United States, my Government contends that it is in violation of the
                            plain and unequivocal agreement of 1879, and asks that the Commercial
                            Cable Company be treated in France upon exactly the same footing as the
                            French company is treated in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cochery’s note meets this request by the following arguments: <list>

                        <p>I have no instruction to discuss these arguments thus so unexpectedly
                            opposed to a request which seemed so natural and so fair that the
                            possibility of its being refused was not anticipated, and I can but
                            refer the whole matter to Mr. Frelinghuysen. I may be permitted to say,
                            however, that I utterly fail to see the force of the position taken by
                            the minister of posts and telegraphs. I fail to perceive, as far as the
                            right of landing and the privileges accruing therefrom are concerned
                            that there exists the slightest difference between the American company
                            and the French company. Both were created with the special object of
                            connecting directly France with the United States, and Mr. Cochery
                            himself thus describes the Commercial Cable Company in the
                            specifications (<hi rend="italic">cahier des charges</hi>) submitted to
                            Messrs. Mackay and Bennett.</p>
                        <p>I trust that further examination of this subject will satisfy your
                            excellency that the objections which Mr. Morton was requested to present
                            against the condition imposed on the American company are just and
                            reasonable, and that they will be removed. The Government of the United
                            States, which cannot be charged with having held the French company too
                            strictly to the formal pledge it has taken, has the right to expect that
                            the American company shall also be fairly dealt with.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency will appeciate whether it is fair and equal treatment to
                            compel this company to submit to terms by which it can be deprived of
                            its privilege at any time, upon a short notice, when no similar
                            condition is to be found in the specifications (<hi rend="italic">cahier
                                des charges</hi>) subscribed to by the other companies established
                            for the exclusive transmission of dispatches between the two countries.
                            To limit its existence” to one year is certainly a serious impediment to
                            the safe establishment in France, of the Commercial Cable Company, which
                            would, besides, find itself upon a most unequal and unfavorable footing
                            compared with other companies.</p>
                        <p>The United States legation does not contest the right of the French
                            Government to affix conditions to any concession it may grant for the
                            establishment of cables; it is also aware that telegraphic lines in
                            France are a Government monopoly, but this cannot assuredly furnish a
                            legitimate motive for discrimination.</p>
                        <p>After a careful perusal of the terms accorded by the French Government in
                            1869 to the English company, in 1879 to the French company, and in 1884
                            to the Commercial Cable Company, I am obliged to say that the latter,
                            instead of receiving in France the treatment which the French company
                            has obtained in the United States, is subjected with respect to the
                            right of landing, as well as to the privilege of connecting its cables
                            with the French land system, to exceptional exigencies prejudicial to
                            its interest.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Frelinghuysen telegraphs Mr. Morton that the United States granted to the
                        French cable company in 1879, at the express request of the French
                        Government through its minister at Washington, the <pb n="156"
                            xml:id="pg_156" facs="0256"/>privilege of landing their cable on the
                        shores of this country. In making this agreement it was expressly stated and
                        made a condition to the concession, that should permission be granted to the
                        company to land its cable in the United States it will be upon the
                        understanding that the reciprocal right of American citizens to similar
                        concessions from the Government of France in laying and operating
                        transmarine cables and connecting them with inland lines in that country
                        should be granted upon suitable application to the French Government, and
                        that the continuance of the privilege might depend upon this reciprocity
                        being recognized by France (see Secretary of State to French minister,
                        October 27, 1879, and September 10 and 22, 1875). Moreover, the condition
                        signed by the company in accepting the grant stated that the company
                        received no exclusive concession from France which would exclude any other
                        line which might thereafter be formed in the United States, from obtaining a
                        like privilege to land on the French coast and connect with the internal
                        telegraphic system of that country.</p>
                    <p>France now denies to the originators of an American cable company the right
                        to land on the French coast because it touches the shore of Ireland and is
                        therefore not direct from France. The French cable touches at St. Pierre,
                        and it is probable that a direct line from the United States to France
                        touching at no intermediate point is impracticable. As the United States has
                        no colonial or outlying possessions, American cables must necessarily touch
                        at some foreign intermediate point. The President does not doubt that France
                        will respect the position taken by the United States as stated above and
                        which was agreed to by the French Government and the French cable company.
                        The interpretation which France now desires to give to the first condition
                        destroys the spirit of the agreement. The President is of opinion that the
                        proposed American cable has a right to land on the French coast under the
                        agreement of 1879. Mr. Morton is directed to act on this instruction in such
                        manner as his good judgment suggests.</p>

                            to land in France upon the same terms granted in the United States to

                            excellency a copy of a dispatch received this morning from the Secretary
                            of State of the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency will see that Mr. Frelinghuysen states, in almost the
                            identical language used by me in the above-mentioned communication, that
                            the agreement of 1879 was intended to assure reciprocity of treatment to
                            any American citizens applying for the privilege of landing in France a
                            cable connecting the two countries. It was not supposed at the time that
                            a question would ever arise upon the route taken by the cables
                            connecting the two countries, and that the fact of touching at an
                            intermediary point could make any difference at all in the matter.</p>
                        <p>The President of the United States believes that the American Commercial
                            Cable Company is entitled to the full and unrestricted right of landing
                            given to the French Cable, and has no doubt that the French Government
                            will come to the same conclusion.</p>
                        <p>It is with this view that I send a copy of the telegram of Mr.
                            Frelinghuysen, which was only intended for the legation, but which shows
                            exactly the position taken by the United States Government in the
                            matter.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. Bartholdi, the eminent French sculptor,
                        author of the statue of “Liberty Enlightening the World,” called upon me
                        some weeks ago to say that the statue was now complete, and that, as the
                        labor of taking it down for shipment to America would require at least three
                        months, it was the intention of the committee of the Franco-American Union
                        to present it at once to me, as the representative of the Government and
                        people of the United States. Mr. Bartholdi added that Mr. Jules Ferry would
                        seize this occasion to associate the French Government with the undertaking
                        of the Franco-American Union, and that he (Mr. Ferry) and other members of
                        the Government would officially take part in the ceremony of
                        presentation.</p>
                    <p>A few days later Mr. Ferry himself confirmed this statement at my house. He
                        said that the statue of Liberty was not only wonderful as a work of art, but
                        as a work entirely due to the individual initiative of Frenchmen friendly to
                        America, and that it was the first time such an undertaking had been
                        successfully carried out without Government aid. The Government, however,
                        did not wish to stand aloof from this great manifestation. It wanted to show
                        publicly that it shared the sentiments which had inspired Mr. Bartholdi, and
                        with this view the minister of the navy, Admiral Peyron, would place a state
                        vessel at the disposition of the committee for the transportation of the
                        statue to New York.</p>
                    <p>This information having reached me too late to be made the object of a
                        written communication to the Department, I briefly stated the facts in my
                        telegram of the 28th of June, to which I duly received your telegraphic
                        reply of July 1, and also one from the Hon. William M. Evarts, chairman of
                        the Franco-American Committee of New York, requesting me to represent and
                        speak for the New York committee.</p>
                    <p>The statue was formally presented to me on the morning of the 4th of July,
                        and I accepted it in the name of the President of the United States and the
                        American people.</p>
                    <p>The ceremony was an interesting and imposing one. It took place in the
                        foundry yard of Messrs. Gaget &amp; Gauthier where the monument has been
                        made, and in presence of a large audience of distinguished guests. Upon a
                        tribune erected in front of the colossal bronze sat the Franco-American
                        Union Committee with its president, M. F. de Lesseps, <pb n="159"
                            xml:id="pg_159" facs="0259"/>with the author of the monument, Mr.
                        Bartholdi, and members of the Government, among whom were conspicuous the
                        president of the Chamber of Deputies, Mr. Brisson, the president of the
                        supreme court, Mr. Cazot, Admiral Peyron, minister of marine, Mr. Herisson,
                        minister of Commerce, Mr. Faillières, minister of public instruction, and
                        Colonel Lichtenstein, representative of the President. The prefect of the
                        Seine, the president of the city council, Senator de Lafayette, and many
                        other high officials and distinguished gentlemen, well known for their
                        Franco-American sympathies, were also present.</p>
                    <p>The yard, which was appropriately decorated with French and American flags,
                        was filled by a large number of citizens of both countries. A band of music
                        played alternately the French and American national airs.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the president of the council, who had been ill for two or
                        three days, could not attend the ceremony, but in the morning he wrote me to
                        explain and apologize for his absence, and at my request M. de Lesseps read
                        his note, which was warmly applauded for its sentiments of interest and
                        sympathy. M. de Lesseps then, speaking in the name of the Union, presented
                        to me the great statue—the eighth wonder of the world, as he called it. His
                        remarks, partly foreign to the object, were, nevertheless, greeted with
                        cheers; for they expressed in warm terms the generous feeling which had
                        inspired this spontaneous manifestation of friendship on the part of the
                        French people. I responded by reading your telegram directing me to accept
                        the statue and by explaining the action of the President and of Congress in
                        the matter.</p>
                    <p>At the close of these addresses the official deed of presentation was signed
                        by the president of the Chamber of Deputies and M. Jules Ferry, in the name
                        of France (it was taken to the house of the latter for that purpose); by me,
                        in the name of the United States; by M. de Lesseps and M. de Lafayette, in
                        the name of the committee of the Franco-American Union; and as witnesses, by
                        many of the assistants.</p>

                            Lesseps.</hi></head>
                        <p>France, monarchical, imperial, or republican, has ever been the friend
                            and ally of the United States of America.</p>
                        <p>Our work of to-day, which is in no wise political, is the work of a
                            hundred thousand subscribers—one hundred and eighty towns have
                            participated therein; a great number of general councils, chambers of
                            commerce, societies of every description. The thought which has inspired
                            France upon this occasion was that of consecrating and cementing the
                            centenarian friendship that unites the two great nations, which the
                            breadth of the ocean cannot separate because there is between the two
                            peoples such a connection of sentiment, that even when an unforeseen
                            difference arises between them, circumstances quickly bring them back to
                            a community of views and of action.</p>
                        <p>Upon the occasion of the excavating of the canal of Panama, for instance,
                            after a moment’s hesitation the United States understood that this work,
                            executed in a free state, should be of universal interest and completed
                            by the common effort of the two friendly nations.</p>
                        <p>The powerful American industry came forward, in fact, to offer its
                            co-operation to the French workmen.</p>
                        <p>It will assure the success of this great enterprise; it will be one more
                            tie between us; it will be the success of the union of the powers of
                            that great American nation with those of France, her old and trusted
                            friend.</p>
                        <p>This union of the genius of the two countries has already produced the
                            greatest movements which have been effected amongst modern nations.</p>
                        <p>We trust that it will beam for a long time to come upon humanity, as the
                            light or our colossal statue emitting its rays at the entrance of the
                            vast continent, the converging points of the whole world.</p>

                            brought to completion.</p>
                        <p>I render homage to our collaborators:</p>
                        <p>To Mr. Bartholdi, who has created a colossal work, the eighth wonder of
                            the world.</p>
                        <p>To Mr. Gaget, the engineer, who, in the material execution of the work,
                            has brought to bear indefatigable zeal and intelligence.</p>
                        <p>To Mr. Eiffel, the great constructor, who has given the guarantee of all
                            his science to the iron-work of the colossus.</p>
                        <p>I must also bring to notice the participation, so important, though
                            modest in appearance, of the heads of the workshops that have conducted
                            these works, Messrs. Bugeret and Baron.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I particularly wish to join in the sentiments of Mr. Bartholdi
                            and of all the collaborators, in thanking his respectable and valiant
                            assistant, Mr. Simon, that courageous sculptor, who, although a
                            septuagenarian, has been the youngest and most indefatigable at work by
                            several years; we all of us would have wished, to see him honored, as he
                            merits, by an official distinction.</p>
                        <p>This work, Mr. Minister, is the production of the enthusiasm of devotion,
                            of the intelligence, of the most noble sentiments that dominate man.</p>
                        <p>It is grand in its conception and realization, it is grand by its
                            proportions; we trust that it will add, by its moral value, to the
                            souvenirs and sentiments that it is to perpetuate.</p>
                        <p>We deliver it into your charge, Mr. Minister, in order that it may ever
                            remain the pledge of the ties which should unite France and the great
                            American nation.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Committee</hi>: I
                            am directed by the President of the United States to accept this
                            colossal statue of “Liberty Enlightening the World,” and to express the
                            thanks of the Government and people of the United States for the statue,
                            as a work of art and as a monument of the abiding friendship of the I
                            people of France, and to assure the committee of the Franco-American
                            Union, the president of the council, and the citizens of the French
                            Republic, that the American people return most heartily the friendly
                            sentiments which prompted this noble gift to America.</p>
                        <p>It is proper that I should recall on this occasion the action of the
                            Government of the United States with regard to the statue of Liberty,
                            the completion of which we witness to-day.</p>
                        <p>When the American Congress was advised that the citizens of France
                            proposed to erect on one of the islands in the harbor of New York the
                            colossal statue of “Liberty Enlightening the World,” it authorized, by a
                            unanimous vote, the President to accept the gift, and to set apart a
                            suitable site for its erection.</p>
                        <p>The President was also directed to cause the statue to be inaugurated,
                            when completed, with such ceremonies as would serve to testily the
                            gratitude of the people of the United States for the monument so
                            felicitously expressive of the sympathy of her sister Republic.</p>
                        <p>The American Congress also ordered provision to be made for its future
                            maintenance as a beacon, and for its preservation and permanent care as
                            a monument of art, and of the continued good will of the great nation
                            which aided her in her struggle for freedom.</p>
                        <p>The President of the United States set apart Bedloe’s Island for the
                            erection of the statue, and I have received a telegram from Messrs.
                            Evarts and Spaulding, of the New York committee, stating that the
                            concrete base, 52 feet high, has been completed and the laying of the
                            granite for the pedestal commenced.</p>
                        <p>The thought which inspired M. Bartholdi, the eminent author of this
                            triumph of art; the participation in this gift of Senators Oscar and
                            Edmond de Lafayette, the Marquis de Rochambeau, and other descendants of
                            the sons of France who fought by the side of Washington; the
                            participation also of M. de Lesseps, the illustrious president of the
                            Franco-American Union, of his distinguished predecessor, Senator
                            Laboulaye, the French interpreter of the American Constitution, of
                            Senator Henri Martin, the great historian, and their distinguished
                            associates; the presence on this occasion Qf several members of the
                            Government and the representative of the President of this great
                            Republic; the proposal of the French Government, through the minister of
                            marine, to transport this statue to New York in a Government frigate,
                            and the selection of the anniversary day of American Independence for
                            this ceremony, <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0262"/>will all only
                            deepen the grateful appreciation with which your friendly gift will be
                            received by the Government and people of the United States.</p>
                        <p>It was my good fortune, as the representative of my country, to drive the
                            first rivet in this great statue, as it is now to accept it, complete in
                            all its grand proportions, on behalf of the President and people of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>The committee of the Franco-American Union of New York, which was
                            organized to provide the foundations for the statue, will receive it on
                            its arrival with the same feeling of gratitude and emotion which your
                            friendly action has evoked in the heart of every American, and assume
                            the agreeable task of its erection upon the pedestal on Bedloe’s
                            Island.</p>
                        <p>God grant that it may stand until the end of time, as an emblem of
                            imperishable sympathy and affection between the Republics of France and
                            the United States.</p>

                        <p>The biggest statue in creation was duly inaugurated yesterday—so far as

                            authorized by Congress to order such ceremonial as he may deem fitting
                            for the occasion.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday’s fête was of an altogether familiar character, as best suited
                            the circumstances <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0263"/>and the
                            situation, for it took place in the yard of a workshop. It was the mere
                            formal handing over of the statue by the representative of the French
                            republic to the representative of the American Republic. If anything
                            could have unbent the impassive features of the statue, it would be the
                            thought of her being “handed over” by any of the pigmies at her feet.
                            She towered above the yard, and the workshops, and the people, and
                            dwarfed everything into absolute insignificance; even the American flag,
                            proudly flying from the torch at the end of her outstretched arm, seemed
                            a mere ornament of a bride-cake. It was impossible to give one’s self
                            airs in such a presence, and the managers of the fete seemed to have
                            felt this, and to have arranged everything on a becoming scale of
                            modesty of pretense. The ceremony took place in a kind of shed run up in
                            the yard, and it derived its sole importance from the character and
                            quality of the people who took part in it.</p>

                        <p>There was a distinguished crowd, both of Americans and Frenchmen. In the
                            latter quite a group of ministers and high officials: the president of
                            the Chamber; the minister of agriculture, M. Herisson; the minister of
                            finance, M. Tirard; the minister of marine, Admiral Peyron; M. de
                            Failières, minister of public instruction; Colonel Lichtenstein,
                            representing the President of the Republic, with two officers
                            representing the minister of war; M. Oscar de Lafayette; Baronne de
                            Pages, grandneice of the hero Montcalm; the prefect of the Seine; the
                            vice-president of the municipal council, M. Antonin Proust; Senators
                            Noblot, Millaud, and Oudet; M. Caudet; M. Philippe Burty, the eminent
                            critic; M. Dietz-Monin, president of the chamber of commerce; M. Henner
                            and M. Armand Dumaresq, the painters; and Dr. Ricord, of Baltimore.</p>
                        <p>Among the Americans were Consul-General Walker and Messrs. Brulatour and
                            Vignaud, who accompanied their chief; ex-Senator Baldwin, of Michigan;
                            Governor Cheney; Senator James B. Eustis, Louisiana; General Draper, of
                            Boston; Judge Batchelor; Dr. Howard; Dr. Wixom; Messrs. Reinhart,
                            Dannat, Mosler, Bacon; Dr. Evans; Mr. Munroe; Mr. Harjes; Mr. Gillig;
                            Mr. Roberts and Mr. Hobson; Mr. King; Dr. Chapman; Professor Yeatman;
                            Dr. Nachtel; Mr. Fettridge; Mr. Theo. Stanton; and Maj. R. N. Brown, a
                            nephew of Major-General Brown, Commanding General of the United States
                            Army, and brother of the late Maj T. S. Brown, consulting engineer to
                            the Czar Nicholas.</p>
                        <p>The costumes were, in most instances, suited to the time of day and the
                            weather; but a few devoted Frenchmen, out of reverence to the statue,
                            had donned full evening dress. They formed, as has been said, a crowd of
                            pigmies; but the people in the houses overlooking the founder’s yard, in
                            the Rue de Chazelles, carried the view at least up to the waist of the
                            colossus, and so served a little to fill in the composition in an
                            artistic sense.</p>
                        <p>At about half-past eleven M. de Lesseps arrived, and took up his position
                            on the platform as chairman of the celebration. He was followed by Mr.
                            Morton, and the proceedings immediately commenced by the reading of the
                            letter from M. Ferry, excusing himself from attendance on account of ill
                            health, but saying, and saying truly, that the Government of the
                            Republic would be represented by more than one minister.</p>

                        <p>When Mr. Morton had read his reply, he invited all present to sign the
                                <hi rend="italic">procès verbal</hi> of the ceremony, and set the
                            example himself. Then came the president of the Chamber to sign, with a
                            shaking hand, in the name of France; then the ministers, in their turn;
                            and finally, the rank and file. The signing was done with a goose-quill,
                            prettily tied with emblematic colors; and it was worn out long before
                            the end of the proceedings. The paper was covered with names, north and
                            south, east and west; dozens signed sideways on the margin, and at last
                            it became a piece of positive ill breeding to those who were to follow
                            to write one’s signature large.</p>
                        <p>After this, the illustrious company, with M. Bartholdi leading the way,
                            went to see the statue, entering by the door in the sole of the uplifted
                            foot, and toiling steadily up the double staircase, with nothing to
                            guide their steps but the ten thousand little eyelets of sunlight that
                            came through the rivet holes. Only a few persevered to the summit; most
                            of them gave up half way, and, confounding the two staircases for the
                            ascent and descent, were for some time lost to the world. It was the
                            fancy of Rabelais again—with his pigmies wandering about in the interior
                            of the monster. The president of the Chamber went gallantly to the top,
                            and saw Paris from the opening in the coronet, but he did not wait while
                            the man went to fetch the key to the staircase in the arm, which towered
                            up into a first story at the elbow and a second at the hand. While this
                            was going on, the people below took modest refreshments at the buffet at
                            the back of the platform, and after them came, very fittingly, the
                            workmen who had built up the thing piece by piece. This, with the
                            distribution of the commemorative medal, closed the proceedings in the
                            yard; and all that remains to be <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0264"
                            />said about the statue is that it will stand in its place until the end
                            of the month, and will then be taken down for transport in a French ship
                            of war to its destination.</p>
                        <p>After the ceremony, the high officials present, to the number of some
                            twenty-five, went to breakfast with M. le Senateur Arbel, in the Rue de
                            Courcelles. Mme. Arbel and Mme. Bartholdi were the only ladies present,
                            M. de Lesseps, Mr. Morton, and M. Bartholdi made short speeches, and the
                            work, the committee, and the artist received their fair share of
                            praise.</p>

                        <p rend="center">[From the London Daily News.]</p>
                        <p>We publish in another column this morning a full description of the
                            gigantic statue which M. Ferry, on behalf of the French, will to-morrow
                            present to the American people, through the United States minister in
                            Paris. The statue is the fit successor in these modern times of the
                            colossus which was in ancient days one of the world’s seven wonders. It
                            is to stand on one of the islands in the magnificent bay of New York, as
                            a sort of vast light-house, or light-bearer, welcoming the traveler from
                            the Old World as he enters the New World. The project and execution are
                            characteristic of the French people. There is an air of romance about it
                            which touches the fancy of an imaginative nation. It is a kind of
                            celebration of the Republic, a declaration of friendship and sympathy
                            from one republican people to another. It is the more remarkable, too,
                            because the legend which most astonished M. Guizot when he read it on
                            some of our great charitable institutions in London might, with a slight
                            change, be inscribed on M. Bartholdi’s colossus. It has originated in a
                            popular movement, and has been paid for by voluntary subscriptions. It
                            is literally the spontaneous gift of the French people to the Americans,
                            a testimony of their hearty admiration of American freedom.</p>
                        <p>The colossal size of the statue is appropriate to a country where
                            everything is on a gigantic scale. On its pedestal, and with its
                            outstretched hand, this huge figure is higher than any light-house on
                            our own coasts or than any mere monument in this capital. It is most
                            ingeniously constructed, and is, even in that respect, the most striking
                            work of the statuary’s art ever produced. It will, no doubt, be accepted
                            by the Americans in the cordial spirit in which it is offered, and it
                            may be hoped that it may long stand in its commanding position at the
                            beautiful entrance to New York bay as a material embodiment and token of
                            the cordial feeling of two great peoples who are mutually indebted to
                            each other.</p>

                        <p>Later in the afternoon, the usual Fourth of July reception was held at
                            Mr. Morton’s, and many of those present at the ceremony of the morning
                            met one another once more.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received the two letters, of the
                            17th and 24th of last month, that Mr. Brulatour has had the goodness to
                            address to me with reference to the concession of a submarine
                            telegraphic line to the Commercial Cable Company, represented by Messrs.
                            Bennett and Mackay.</p>
                        <p>To the second of these communications was annexed the copy of a telegram
                            from the Secretary of State, who insists upon the suppression in the
                            contract signed by that company with the French administration of
                            certain conditions that the Washington Cabinet consider as being at
                            variance with the treatment of reciprocity agreed to between the two
                            Governments in 1879 upon the establishment of the direct
                            line-constructed by the French Company Paris–New York.</p>
                        <p>In response to the communication that I addressed to to the minister of
                            posts and telegraphs on the subject, he observes that it is proper to
                            state precisely under what conditions the Government of the Union
                            granted in 1879, upon the application of the French Government, the
                            concession of a cable to be landed in the United States.</p>
                        <p>With this object, Mr. Cochery sets forth, in the first place, that the
                            cable conceded in 1879 was a direct cable; he recalls, in the second
                            place, the exact terms of the correspondence exchanged between the
                            minister of the Republic at Washington with reference to the
                            authorization to land granted to the French company; it results
                            therefrom, on the one hand, that M. Outrey gave to the Federal Cabinet
                            “the assurance that the French Government would make no difficulty in
                            according, in case of need, to American subjects, the same privileges as
                            to its own fellow-countrymen;” on the other hand, that the Government of
                            the Union would grant to the French company the right to land, upon the
                            sole condition that this company would comply with the general laws that
                            Congress might be called upon to enact with reference to submarine
                            cables. The communication of the Department of State, which notified the
                            said authorization, contains, in effect, the following reservation: “It
                            should be well understood by the company that the authorization that it
                            receives is subservient to all the measures that Congress may take in
                            the future with reference to submarine telegraphs.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cochery is of opinion that there is reason to notice in these
                            communications that the authorization given by the Government of the
                            United States was not pure and simple, but that it was subordinate to
                            the measures that your Government might subsequently take with reference
                            to submarine cables, and that the only demand to the Government of the
                            Republic, with a view of reciprocity, was to concede to American
                            citizens the <hi rend="italic">same privilege as to French</hi>
                            citizens.</p>
                        <p>As far as concerns reciprocity, it has already been stated in the note
                            from Mr. Cochery, which I had the honor to bring to your knowledge on
                            the 13th of last month, that the cable of the Company “Paris-New York”
                            was a direct cable between France and America, while the cable of the
                            “Commercial Company” is a cable between France and Ireland which, from
                            this latter country, pursues its course to the United States. It does
                            not appear necessary to insist in order to show the difference which
                            exists between these two concessions.</p>
                        <p>It may not, however, be useless to recall that at the time of the
                            concession granted to M. Pouyer Quertier, the French Government held
                            essentially that the cable should be direct and should not make use of
                            the territory of any foreign nation before arriving in America. The
                            relay established at St. Pierre by the French company in nowise
                            infringes this condition, since the island of St. Pierre is a French
                            possession, and that to establish the Pouyer Quertier cable by means of
                            this intermediary point it was only necessary to have recourse to the
                            authorization of France and the United States.</p>
                        <p>It is not the same for the Mackay-Bennett cable, as apart from the
                            consent of the two states in question the grantees will be obliged to
                            obtain the consent of England for the landing in Ireland. And even
                            supposing that a direct communication is established between Havre and
                            the United States, it can only be worked with the authorization of the
                            English Government which, according to the information transmitted “to
                            me by Mr. Cochery, would impose very restrictive conditions, especially
                            the limitation of the authorization of landing to the year 1889. Under
                            these conditions the French administration was justified in refusing
                            Messrs. Bennett and Mackay the right of landing their cable, without, in
                            reality, affecting the promise of reciprocity agreed to in 1879 by the
                            two Governments; this right, however, which, up to the present time, had
                            not been granted, was conceded to them under certain conditions
                            specified in this stipulation.</p>
                        <p>As you are aware, Messrs. Mackay and Bennett accepted these conditions,
                            and, on date of the 13th of March last, you were good enough to
                            communicate to me the thanks of the Government of the United States.</p>
                        <p>To the preceding observation Mr. Cochery adds that he is ignorant of what
                            has taken place since the above obtainment, but the grantees have
                            allowed the periods <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0266"/>prescribed
                            by the stipulations to expire without fulfilling the formalities
                            intended to make the position regular, and that, in fact, they have
                            given to the administration the right of refusing them a new
                            concession.</p>
                        <p>The minister of posts and telegraphs adds that this is certainly the
                            jurisprudence that his department would apply to <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>Nevertheless, in consideration of the support given by the legation of
                            the United States to the application of Messrs. Mackay and Bennett, the
                            French administration has not set it aside, and has even consented to
                            substitute a simple clause of common right, that of denunciation of the
                            contract a year in advance to the right of repurchase that the original
                            contract reserved to the Government of the Republic.</p>
                        <p>The conditions inserted in the contract are, besides, those that the
                            administration would impose upon every Frenchman who might apply for a
                            similar concession to land.</p>
                        <p>Upon the whole, Messrs. Mackay and Bennett are not placed in the same
                            conditions as M. Pouyer Quertier, who had applied to the Government of
                            the United States to land a direct cable.</p>
                        <p>Besides, the conditions of the concession made to the Commercial Cable
                            Company are those that the French administration would impose upon their
                            fellow-countrymen.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it must be observed that these conditions have been discussed by
                            the administration of posts and telegraphs and M. le Comte Dillon,
                            representative of Messrs. Mackay and Bennett; that the clauses have been
                            accepted by him, and that the clauses of the contract, for the most
                            part, were spontaneously proposed by the grantees.</p>
                        <p>In this state of things, which I shall be obliged to you to expose to
                            your Government, you will acknowledge, sir, I have no doubt, that the
                            contract in question in nowise infringes the engagements agreed upon in
                            1879 by the Government of the Republic.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your communication of the 8th instant, in relation to the
                            request of my Government for reciprocal treatment when an American
                            transatlantic cable company seeks the privilege of landing its cables
                            upon the shores of France.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency states substantially that the treatment of reciprocity is
                            not refused to the Commercial Cable Company, in whose behalf I have
                            asked for the right of landing in France, but that this company, having
                            only an indirect communication with the United States, was not entitled
                            to the same terms granted to the French company, whose lines are direct;
                            that the agreement of 1879 between France and the United States meant
                            equal treatment of Americans and Frenchmen desiring to establish
                            telegraphic communication across the ocean, and that the conditions
                            imposed upon the Commercial Cable Company are exactly those which the
                            French Government impose upon any French company situated in the same
                            manner and making the same application.</p>
                        <p>I shall lose no time in making known this reply to my Government, but in
                            awaiting its answer I may be permitted one remark.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency states that the Commercial Cable Company had accepted the
                            condition, objected to now, affixed to the concession of the privilege
                            of landing, when, by instruction of my Government, Mr. Morton thanked
                            you for having made it. I must say here that Mr. Frelinghuysen became
                            aware of the concession only through your communication of February,
                            1884 (no date), which did not mention “that the privilege thus granted
                            was liable to be suppressed at any time, upon a year’s notice.” I must
                            also repeat that the objectections of my Government have not in view the
                            particular interests of the Commercial Cable Company, but a question of
                            principle involving the interests of every concession.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Frelinghuysen telegraphs Mr. Morton to the effect that the commercial
                        cable is as direct as the French cable, inasmuch as both touch at a point
                        between France and the United States. The fact that St. Pierre is French is
                        of no consequence, as, in the nature of things, any American cable must
                        touch at some point before reaching France, and upon foreign soil, as we
                        have no foreign possessions. To deny this right is consequently to deny the
                        United States the reciprocal obligation of the agreement; for no cable has
                        been laid and probably none will be laid which, does not touch at some
                        intermediate station between the United States and the continent of Europe.
                        It is considered almost impracticable to lay one otherwise.</p>
                    <p>The provision as to measures of Congress in the future cannot be used against
                        the present application; for any such measure if passed would be general in
                        its bearings and would apply equally to all cables, American, French,
                        English, or other, while Mr. Ferry now desires to impose upon the Commercial
                        Cable Company restrictions not imposed upon the French company now in
                        existence.</p>
                    <p>Further, the agreement of 1879 stipulates for reciprocal treatment in France
                        of French and American cable companies. Mr. Ferry now proposes conditions to
                        which the present existing company is not subjected. The fact that any
                        company established hereafter would be subjected to like conditions is not
                        of importance, as present and not future facts are now under consideration.
                        The United States claims for the Commercial Company the same rights as those
                        at present enjoyed by the existing French company.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Morton is instructed to bring these considerations to Mr. Ferry’s
                        attention, using this telegram as a text on which to base his arguments.</p>
                    <p>It is thought that the question should be speedly settled, in accordance with
                        the spirit of the agreement, stipulating for equal privileges to American
                        and French cable companies.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Upon receipt, on the 18th instant, of your two
                        cipher telegrams of the 17th, I arranged an interview with the president of
                        the council that afternoon, when I informed him that while at Ragatz with my
                        family, <hi rend="italic">en route</hi> for St. Moritz, I received a
                        telegram from you requesting me to return to Paris to confer with him with
                        reference to the difficulty which had arisen respecting the concessions to
                        the Commercial Cable Company.</p>
                    <p>I then stated that you had been informed, by telegraph and by mail, of the
                        reply made to the representations of the legation by himself and <pb n="168"
                            xml:id="pg_168" facs="0268"/>by M. Cochery, that you could not see any
                        difference in the situation of the Commercial and French companies, and that
                        you insisted upon equal treatment for both. I called his attention
                        particularly to every point mentioned in your telegram, namely, that the
                        fact of touching at Ireland could not make the Commercial cable an indirect
                        one, if the French cable, which touched at St. Pierre, was a direct one;
                        that to touch at some point <hi rend="italic">en route</hi> was a practical
                        necessity; that to affix to the privilege of landing granted to the
                        Commercial Company conditions not imposed on the French company,
                        particularly the clause by which this privilege can be canceled upon one
                        year’s notice, was to deny to us the reciprocal obligations of the agreement
                        of 187<gap quantity="1" unit="words"/>; and finally, that the provision of
                        this agreement in relation to future legislation by Congress could not be
                        invoked, because such legislation would be general, whereas it was sought to
                        place the Commercial Company on a different footing from that of the French
                        company.</p>
                    <p>M. Ferry said that this matter was in the hands of his colleague, the
                        minister of posts and telegraphs, to whose attention he would bring it at
                        the cabinet meeting of the next morning; he had only a general knowledge of
                        the subject, but he knew very well that the French Government had no
                        intention whatever to claim unequal or unfair conditions of the Commercial
                        Company.</p>
                    <p>I replied that I was pleased to receive this assurance; for my Government,
                        last year, when the question was raised in Congress that the French company
                        had forfeited its privilege by combining with other companies to establish
                        uniform rates, did not press the investigation, but it might be forced to
                        notice this plain violation of the agreement of 1879 should the question be
                        brought forward.</p>
                    <p>M. Ferry made no reply to this remark, and it was agreed that I should see
                        him in the morning, when he stated that the whole difficulty was caused by
                        the fact that the Commercial cable was not a direct one; “but,” said I, “we
                        contend that it is as much so as the French cable, which stops at St.
                        Pierre.” “It is not,” he replied; “the Pouyer Quertier cable is a
                        Franco-American cable; it connects directly no other countries but France
                        and America, and it can transmit directly, without borrowing from any
                        foreign country, French messages to America, or American messages to France;
                        it stops at St. Pierre, not to receive a feeder. Whereas the Commercial
                        Company is, in fact, an Anglo-American cable, with a separate branch line to
                        France; it connects directly no other countries but Great Britain and
                        America, and all French messages intended for America, or American messages
                        intended for France, are received and retransmitted from British soil. It
                        does not merely stop to facilitate the submarine transmission; it ends there
                        practically for the purpose of taking the British traffic which is to be its
                        principal source of income. In short, the particular cable which the
                        Commercial Company intends to land at Havre is entirely out of the control
                        of the United States. It cannot be laid without the consent of Great
                        Britain, and France herself cannot give this consent, for she has granted to
                        the English Submarine Company the monopoly of laying across the Channel all
                        the cables connecting France with Great Britain, which monopoly expires only
                        in 1889. If such is not the case, why has the Commercial Company been
                        obliged to purchase from the Submarine Company the privilege of laying its
                        cable between France and Ireland?”</p>
                    <p>To my inquiry, if he found there a justifiable motive for denying to an
                        American company the reciprocal treatment promised to it in good faith
                        through the agreement of 1879, he instantly replied that such treatment was
                        not denied to the Commercial Company, that it was placed <pb n="169"
                            xml:id="pg_169" facs="0269"/>upon exactly the same footing as all the
                        French companies to which, during late years, concessions had been made, and
                        that even the Pouyer Quertier company was subjected to the condition (of
                        which we complained particularly) of having its privilege canceled at the
                        will of the Government, because it is a principle of law in Prance that all
                        unlimited concessions can be ended at the pleasure of the state.</p>
                    <p>“If such is your right,” said I, “why do you insist upon affixing this
                        obnoxious clause to the charter of the Commercial Company?” “Because,” he
                        replied, “it is now a rule of this Government to do so in every instance;
                        but,” he added, “I beg you to believe that we have not the remotest
                        intention of taking advantage of this clause, which is made necessary under
                        our European system, but which would never be applied except under, very
                        pressing emergencies. To convince you, however, of our conciliatory
                        disposition, we are willing to assure to the Commercial Company a delay of
                        two years, or even three years, before this clause could be applicable.” I
                        said my Government had more in view the question of principle than the
                        particular interest of the Commercial Company, and that you claimed entire
                        reciprocity. He repeated that we enjoyed the benefit of the full reciprocity
                        contemplated by the agreement of 1879, and to be better enlightened in this
                        respect he advised me to see M. Cochery, who, he was sure, would make the
                        matter very clear to me.</p>
                    <p>I accordingly called on the minister of posts and telegraphs, with whom I
                        have had two conferences, during which the subject was fully discussed in
                        the most friendly manner. M. Cochery reasserted most emphatically each of
                        the statements which the president of the council had made. He explained
                        that the rules applicable to telegraphic lines are now liable to be
                        frequently changed for the better; that in 1879 it was not deemed necessary
                        to mention in the stipulations of the French company that its privilege
                        could be suspended at the will of the Government, but that tor several years
                        not a single telegraphic line had been conceded by France without this
                        clause, and he produced many of the original contracts of such concessions,
                        in every one of which I read, “The Government will have the right, at any
                        time, to suspend or withdraw the right to use the line conceded without
                        being bound to pay any indemnity, or to reimburse any cost.”</p>
                    <p>“Such being the case,” he argued, “the Commercial Company cannot expect to
                        receive better terms than those actually made to others, and we are fully in
                        accord with the spirit and letter of the agreement of 1879 when we grant to
                        that company what we grant to our own people. But we have gone beyond that;
                        in allowing that company to lay a cable across the Channel—if the Submarine
                        Company to which this monopoly belongs does not object—we have given,
                        through high regard for your Government and people, an exceptional favor,
                        which has already been to me a source of many annoyances, and for which I am
                        threatened with an interpellation at the Chamber. Should I remove from the
                        stipulations of this company the clause of which you complain, what defense
                        shall I make when charged at the Chamber with having given unnecessary
                        facilities to a foreign company, established to compete with a French line
                        through English channels? Let the Commercial Company establish a direct
                        line, a line under the sole control of the United States and France, and I
                        will instantly grant to it the identical terms granted to the Pouyer
                        Quertier company (although we do not now grant such terms), because I would
                        then be protected by the agreement of 1879, which binds me in one case, and
                        not in the other.</p>
                    <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0270"/>
                    <p>“The claims you are pressing upon me,” he added with much warmth and feeling,
                        “is an unjust one under the circumstances; it has no foundation in equity,
                        and it is particularly painful to me, for it implies on your part the
                        supposition that I can be party to an unfair arrangement. I give you my word
                        of honor that we have not the slightest intention of embarrassing the
                        Commercial Company or of loading it with burdensome conditions. This one
                        year’s notice clause is now more a matter of form and of rule than anything
                        else; it is a guarantee for the Government, and not a scheme to deprive an
                        honest company of its legitimate property.”</p>
                    <p>Finally M. Cochery said that in deference to your and to my personal
                        interposition, he will add to the stipulations of the Commercial Company a
                        clause stating that the provision giving to the Government the right to
                        cancel its privilege upon one year’s notice will not be applicable before
                        the 12th of January, 1889, when the monopoly given to the Submarine Company
                        for the Channel cables will expire, and when it will become necessary for
                        France and England to establish new regulations for all submarine
                        cables.</p>
                    <p>I must say that M. Cochery’s language struck me as being perfectly sincere,
                        and that he, as well as M. Ferry, seems truly animated with the desire of
                        treating this matter fairly and to our entire satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>They both declare that the reciprocal treatment we claim is more than secured
                        to the Commercial Company; that the stipulations presented to this company
                        are those to which every other company has subscribed, and that though the
                        clause canceling the privilege granted at the option of the Government is
                        not inscribed in the stipulations of the Pouyer Quertier company, it is
                        nevertheless binding upon that company. They both also state, with equal
                        positiveness of language, that the clause is not intended to work, and will
                        not work, any injustice against the Commercial Company.</p>
                    <p>It seems difficult to doubt the sincerity of this language. I have had with
                        both M. Ferry and M. Cochery intimate personal relations during the last
                        three years, and I cannot but entertain a high opinion of their characters,
                        of their sympathies for our Government and people, and of their true desire
                        of being agreeable to us. I have had so many evidences that it is impossible
                        for me to question, in this instance, their good-will and friendly
                        intentions.</p>
                    <p>M. Cochery also said he would concede a special wire to the Commercial
                        Company from Havre to Paris.</p>
                    <p>I have not accepted the proposition of M. Cochery, which is practically the
                        proposition of the French Government, but I believe the conditions named are
                        all the French Government can concede under the circumstances; it is really
                        crippled by its commitments to the Submarine Company and by the precedents
                        established by existing contracts with its own citizens; it feels that it is
                        carrying out, in good faith, the spirit as well as the letter of the mutual
                        agreement of 1879, when M. On trey gave “the assurance that the French
                        Government would make no difficulty in according, in case of need, to
                        American citizens the same privileges as to its own fellow-countrymen.”</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 13th of August I telegraphed you that
                        after further conferences with the minister of posts and telegraphs he had
                        substantially agreed to the following terms: <list>

                            <item>To authorize the Commercial Cable Company to reduce its rates

                                the 12th of January, 1889, when the monopoly given to the Submarine
                                Company expires, or the general clause inserted in all French
                                concessions stating that the Government will have the right at any
                                time to suspend or to withdraw the right to use the line conceded
                                without being bound to pay any indemnity or to reimburse any

                    <p>As the terms herein accepted were not entirely satisfactory to M. de Castro,
                        one of the two representatives here of the Commercial Cable Company, I
                        telegraphed you the same day as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Representative of Cable Company here objects to the limit of 1889,
                                and would prefer the general clause under which French Government
                                has the right to revoke at any time concession made, provided it is
                                stated that this clause is applicable to all existing lines. I shall

                    <p>On the 29th, after many interviews and conferences with the high officials of
                        the postal and telegraphic departments, M. Cochery being absent, I sent you
                        by cable this dispatch: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            <p>Referring to my telegram of August 23, stating that the
                                representative of the Cable Company objected to the limit of 1889
                                and preferred the general clause under which French Government has
                                the right to revoke at any time concessions made, provided it is
                                stated that all French and foreign telegraph companies holding a
                                French concession are subjected to this condition, I have to report
                                that the minister of posts and telegraphs is willing to address me
                                an official communication containing this statement. The minister
                                explains that the right here claimed is not to be used unless under
                                extreme emergencies, but that it is one no state can renounce; it is
                                a high police right recognized by international law and belongs to
                                the United States as well as to all nations. This arrangement seems
                                to be quite satisfactory to the representative of the Cable Company
                                here, at whose request I have also asked and obtained the drivilege
                                that the rates may be raised to 2.50 francs instead of 2 francs.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>I supposed that everything was then settled, so far, at least, as the French
                        administration was concerned. This was my understanding, as well as yours,
                        and on the 1st of September you instructed me to accept, under reserve, the
                        proposition made. Your telegram of the 1st September was translated as
                        follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Under the circumstances you may accept French proposition stated in

                                reciprocity which the United States may have, leaving that as
                                subject for future discussion, without prejudice to the United

                                which belongs to every Government, but that this right is one of
                                which no use would be made except under extraordinary circumstances,
                                and that the French Government has neither the intention nor the

                    <p>When this letter was written, M. Cochery was still absent. Upon his return to
                        Paris, he requested Mr. Vignaud to call, and declared to him very frankly
                        that it was impossible for him to write to me in his offieal character a
                        letter by which he would assent to the propositions set forth in my
                        communication, as he could not do so consistently with his previous
                        engagements and the rules of his department.</p>
                    <p>After two long conferences with Mr. Vignaud, he finally agreed to the
                        following memorandum, which states exactly what he is now willing to do.
                        This memorandum was reduced to writing by Mr. Vignaud and submitted to M.
                        Cochery, who approved it.</p>

                        <p>With reference to the right of landing in France the cables of the
                            Bennett-Mackay American Company for which the Government of the United
                            States has made application to the Government of the Republic, the
                            minister of posts and telegraphs has had the goodness to furnish the
                            following verbal explanations upon various points of the specifications
                            of this company.</p>
                        <p>The minister of posts and telegraphs consents that the rate of
                            dispatches, instead of being fixed at 2 francs, should be increased to
                            2.50 francs In case a decrease of the rates should take place, the
                            minister, while reserving his absolute right of opposing any increase,
                            explained that, as a rule, he never does so oppose when a decrease has
                            been brought about by the necessity of fighting against the proceedings
                            of a competition.</p>
                        <p>The minister also explained that in reserving the right of the
                            administration to suspend or to put an end to the right of landing, he
                            only conforms to a general clause imposed without distinction upon all
                            the present concessions; he added, that even the Pouyer Quertier
                            Company, by the fact of there not being a date fixed for the termination
                            of its concession, is by virtue of French law and jurisprudence
                            subjected to limitations.</p>
                        <p>The minister further stated that it should be understood (1) that the
                            rates charged between any points whatever in the United States and
                            France shall not be higher than those charged between this same point
                            and any of the European countries, and (2) that the cable, of which the
                            right to land is applied for, and which connects France and the United
                            States after touching at a point in Ireland, shall be submitted to the
                            regulations of the London convention.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the minister said, that to give to the United States a proof of
                            his good will he consents that the concession granted to the American
                            company shall in no case be withdrawn before the 12th January, 1889,
                            upon which date the monoply of the Submarine Company expires.</p>

                    <p>In his conversation with Mr. Vignaud, M. Cochery dwelt at length upon his
                        desire of complying with our request and of extending to the Commercial
                        Cable Company all possible facilities, but he insisted that it would be
                        quite improper for him to state in writing that the police right of revoking
                        a telegraphic concession, which he considered essential to every Government,
                        will not be used under ordinary circumstances, although such is the
                        fact.</p>
                    <p>You will observe that although he formerly emphatically declared that no
                        Government could yield the police right to revoke a telegraphic concession,
                        and still professes that such right is necessary to every Government, he now
                        assents to your conditions, as stated in your telegram of August 23, that
                        under no circumstances will he avail himself of this right before 1889.</p>
                    <p>As this matter does not seem to be as urgent now as it was before, I shall
                        await your instructions before taking any further steps in the premises.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatch, No. 477, of date March 25,
                        1884, instructed Mr. Morton to lay before the French Government the case of
                        Mr. John B. Foichat, a naturalized American citizen of French origin, who,
                        while visiting his native town, was arrested and subjected to harsh
                        treatment for having failed to report himself for military service when he
                        was of age, and who, for this reason, claims an indemnity.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Morton, however, was requested to present this case only if the facts
                        upon which it rested were correct. These facts having been found to be so,
                        Mr. Morton laid the whole matter before M. Jules Ferry in a communication
                        dated April 22, 1884, embodying in substance, and partly in form, your own
                        clear and forcible statement of the case.</p>
                    <p>M. Ferry’s answer came to hand only a few days ago; it is dated October 27,
                        and I send herewith a copy and a translation of it, together with a copy of
                        Mr. Morton’s note.</p>
                    <p>The French Government admits substantially the facts of the case.
                        Notwithstanding his American papers, Foichat was arrested on the charge of
                        being an “<hi rend="italic">insoumis</hi>.” He was handcuffed and confined
                        in prison; but the French Government denies that these facts entitle Foichat
                        to any compensation, and maintains the ground it has invariably taken each
                        time the legation has interfered on behalf of American citizens of French
                        birth who had been naturalized after military service was due, viz, that
                        every Frenchman is liable to be called to perform military service, and that
                        to refuse to discharge this important public duty is an offense punishable
                        by law, which the acquisition of foreign citizenship cannot remove,
                        particularly when the change of nationality has taken place for the very
                        purpose of avoiding the performance of that duty, which is generally the
                        case.</p>
                    <p>Pressure of work prevents me from adding anything to this communication. I
                        propose, however, to send by our next pouch a dispatch reviewing the whole
                        subject of American citizens of French origin who have not performed
                        military service in France.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I am directed by my Government to call the
                            attention of your excellency to the case of Mr. John B. Foichat, an
                            American citizen who claims due reparation for the harsh treatment to
                            which he was subjected while visiting France last year.</p>
                        <p>It appears from the sworn statement of Foichat, a copy of which is
                            herewith inclosed, that he was born at Bordeaux (Savoie) on the 4th of
                            January, 1853, In 1870, when seventeen years of age, he went to the
                            United States and has ever since resided in the State of Indiana. In
                            May, 1883, he was regularly admitted to citizenship of the United States
                            by the circuit court of the State of Indiana for Parke County. In
                            August, 1883, he obtained a passport from the Department of State, with
                            a view of revisiting his native town and his relations there, and
                            arrived in Bordeaux in September, 1883. On the 22d of November
                            following, he was arrested on the charge of having failed, when he
                            attained the age of 21 years, to report for military service. He
                            exhibited <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0275"/>his passport,
                            certificate of naturalization, and demanded to be released and allowed
                            to proceed on his way. These papers, together with his private papers,
                            were seized and retained by the officers, and he was kept in the
                            military prison at Chambéry two days and three nights; he was then
                            handcuffed and taken to the military prison at Grenoble to be tried by
                            court-martial; then he was imprisoned in a cell and his valuables all
                            taken from him. He was detained at Grenoble for four days. His case at
                            last reached the ear of B. F. Peixotto, esq., United States consul at
                            Lyons, and through the efforts of that officer Foichat was released on
                            the ground of his American citizenship.</p>
                        <p>The correctness of this statement having been confirmed by the American
                            consul at Lyons, who took pleasure, however, in acknowledging the
                            courtesy of the high officials to whom he applied in behalf of Foichat,
                            complaining only of the action of subordinates, I must concur in the
                            view expressed by the Department of State, “that aside from the mere
                            personal inconvenience and expense to which Mr. Foichat was subjected,
                            the transaction involved an unwarranted and seemingly unnecessary
                            indignity offered to a citizen of the United States which this
                            Government cannot suffer to pass unnoticed.”</p>
                        <p>I am, therefore, instructed by the honorable Secretary of State to
                            present this claim to your excellency, with the earnest request on the
                            part of my Government “that the subject may receive from that of France
                            early and just consideration, and that a reasonable pecuniary indemnity
                            will be awarded and paid on behalf of Mr. Foichat.” “I cannot allow
                            myself to doubt,” says Mr. Frelinghuysen, in words which I am glad to
                            quote, “that the justice of the claim will be at once recognized by the
                            French Government, animated as that Government is by the highest
                            sentiments of liberality and fairness.”</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 22nd of April Mr. Morton drew my
                            attention to the rigorous measures which Mr J. B. Foichat, of French
                            origin, a naturalized citizen of the United States, had incurred at the
                            hands of the French authorities during the latter months of the past
                            year. Mr. Foichat, born on the 4th of January, 1853, at Bordeaux
                            (Savoie), went in 1870 to the United States, where, he acquired, in
                            1883, naturalization. Upon his return to France, at the end of the same
                            year, he was arrested in his native town for insubmission (<hi
                                rend="italic">insoumission</hi>), then set at liberty upon the
                            intervention of the American consul at Lyons. On account of these facts,
                            the Government of the United States considered that a pecuniary
                            compensation should be granted to him.</p>
                        <p>Allow me to recall in the first instance, that upon principle we have
                            constantly refused to admit that a Frenchman, naturalized in a foreign
                            country, can be exempted if he returns to France from being answerable
                            for the offense of insubmission, when the naturalization has taken place
                            subsequently to the existence of the offense. You will understand that
                            we cannot abandon this jurisprudence, which is dictated by a question of
                            public order of a most important character, and against which the
                            Government of the United States would be all the less founded in
                            protesting, as it is in conformity with one of the principal provisions
                            which appear in the treaties of naturalization concluded by it with
                            certain powers.</p>
                        <p>The treaty signed on the 22d of February, 1868, between the United States
                            and Prussia, stipulates in fact (article 2) that a naturalized citizen
                            of either of the contracting parties, in case of return to the territory
                            of origin, can be proceeded against and punished in consequence of acts,
                            qualified as offenses or crime by the laws of such country, which he may
                            have committed before his emigration, unless, according to the laws of
                            his country of origin, he enjoys the privilege of prescription.</p>
                        <p>An inquiry was none the less ordered to be made with reference to the
                            complaints made by Mr. Foichat. I have the honor to communicate to you
                            herewith copy of the report of General Carteret Trecourt, military
                            governor of Lyons, stating the result of the same. As you will perceive,
                            from the perusal of this document, the grievances complained of by Mr.
                            Foichat; are in no wise justified, and do not give him, in consequence,
                            any right to the compensation he solicits.</p>
                        <p>I shall be much obliged if you will acquaint Mr. Frelinghuysen with the
                            reasons which do not permit us to comply with his request, and to have
                            the goodness to insist especially upon the juridical considerations,
                            which oblige us to reserve expressly the right to prosecute, upon his
                            return to France, any individual charged with an infraction against our
                            military laws, committed previously to naturalization abroad.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Foichat having come to France in the month of September, 1883, that
                            is to say, hardly four months after his change of nationality, the
                            French authorities could not be notified that he was an American
                            subject; his name appeared therefore upon the register of
                            insubordinates.</p>
                        <p>Arrested on the 23d of November, he produced an American passport, but
                            this document was not sufficient to obtain his immediate release, the
                            gendarmerie, acting in virtue of a description No. 1, had to keep him in
                            custody, having no capacity to decide upon the authenticity or value of
                            the document submitted to them.</p>
                        <p>Escorted without any resistance before the recruiting commandant of
                            Chambéry, and then to the prison of this town, Mr. Foichat was not
                            subjected to any rigorous measures, the gendarmes, not having handcuffed
                            him, thus taking upon themselves to render as light as possible the
                            application of the general rule.</p>
                        <p>During his transfer, however, from the prison of Chambéry to the military
                            prison of Grenoble, the gendarmes applying in his case the precautionary
                            measures usual in such cases, thought fit to put on the handcuffs.</p>
                        <p>From the information obtained from the military prison of Grenoble, it
                            appears that Mr. Foichat was subjected to the ordinary regulations of
                            the establishment, and that he was not the object of any exceptional
                            measures.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the impediments, according to the complainant, to his
                            communicating with the consul of the United States at Lyons, it is
                            sufficient to state that on the 28th of November I had already been
                            applied to with reference to the claim of Mr. Foichat by the prefect of
                            the Isère, acting at the instance of the consul of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Besides, as soon as the situation of this subordinate had been defined,
                            and that I had the proof of his nationality, I gave orders by telegraph
                            for him to be set at liberty, which took place on the 29th of
                            November.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: When they happen to visit their mother
                        country, American citizens of French origin who have not performed military
                        service in France are much astonished to find that notwithstanding their
                        American passport and citizen papers they are called upon to account for
                        having failed to report themselves for military service when it was due, and
                        subjected in consequence to many inconveniences, sometimes to harsh
                        treatment. They immediately apply to the legation for protection, and when
                        informed that its action in such cases is very limited and mostly dependent
                        upon the good will of the French authorities, they bitterly complain of
                        being unsupported when they had been led to suppose that their acquired
                        citizenship would shield them against inquisitions of this nature, and come
                        very near charging our Government with culpable negligence of one of its
                        most sacred duties—the protection of its adopted citizens traveling or
                        residing abroad.</p>
                    <p>These complaints, although very natural under the circumstances, arise from a
                        misunderstanding of the rights naturalized citizens can legitimately claim
                        from their adopted Government and of the duties that Government assumes
                        towards them. With a view of making this subject clear, I will endeavor to
                        state here the grounds of the action of the French Government in the cases
                        under consideration.</p>
                    <p>Natural citizenship in France is not incidental to the place of birth but <pb
                            n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0277"/>to parentage; it is a privilege
                        obtained by inheritance and transmitted in the same manner. A Frenchman
                        carries with him his nationality wherever he goes, and transmits it to his
                        children wherever they are born. The child of a Frenchman born abroad is
                        French; the child of a foreigner born in France is not French.</p>
                    <p>This principle involves certain logical consequences. When nationality is
                        made to be dependent on the soil it can easily be transferred; in selecting
                        another home a person places himself in the same relation towards his
                        adopted country which he occupied towards the country of his birth.
                        Expatriation in that case leads to a transfer of allegiance. But when
                        national character is given by the blood expatriation does not work of
                        necessity a change of allegiance, because the original conditions remain
                        what they were. In this case one carries with him that which gives him his
                        national character; in the former case he leaves it behind.</p>
                    <p>It is not surprising, therefore, if the countries holding, like France, that
                        natural citizenship is a privilege inherent to the blood, are more or less
                        prejudiced in favor of the doctrine that a person cannot reject his national
                        character of his own motion, that is to say, without the consent of his
                        Government. Such has been the doctrine in France for many years, and,
                        although now it has lost much of its rigidity in its practical bearing, it
                        is still maintained in principle and enforced to a certain extent.</p>
                    <p>No law recognizes in a Frenchman the right of expatriating himself and of
                        throwing off his allegiance. He can do so lawfully only if he obtains the
                        consent of his Government. He may lose his national character, however, by
                        doing a number of things which are described in the Code. Seeking or
                        accepting foreign citizenship is one of these things. A natural-born
                        Frenchman who transfers his allegiance to another country commits an act by
                        which he forfeits his claim to French citizenship and for which he is made
                        to suffer more or less. Unlike any other foreign citizen, for instance, he
                        cannot take up his residence in France without the authorization of the
                        French Government. Again, unlike any other foreign citizen, he cannot bear
                        arms against France without incurring the penalty of death.</p>
                    <p>A Frenchman naturalized abroad, whether with the consent of his Government or
                        without such consent, ceases therefore to be French. Of this there can be no
                        question. But the consequences of the act might be quite different for him
                        in the two cases. If he has secured permission to change his allegiance,
                        nothing is claimed of him when he returns to France; if he has not, three
                        things may happen to him: <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>The validity of the naturalization may be contested in its bearing
                                upon French law and its operation in France. For instance, the
                                change of nationality must have taken place by the free action of
                                the party who claims to have made the change. If obtained through
                                annexation or conquest of a territory it may be declared void. The
                                same if conferred to a minor or to a married woman not authorized by
                                her husband. “If the acquisition of another national character,”
                                says the court of Lyons (judgment of October 19, 1855), “is governed
                                by the laws of the country where it is obtained, the loss of the
                                original character depends only on the country to which the

                            <item>The naturalization, although admitted to be valid in France, may
                                be declared to have no effect as to certain particular things; this
                                happens when the change of nationality is sought and obtained for
                                the purpose of evading the operation of a law. In such cases the
                                naturalization <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0278"/>will not
                                hold against that <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> law.
                                “Naturalization sought exclusively for the purpose of violating a
                                French law,” says the court of the Seine, 1877, “cannot hold against
                                the interests of public and private order, which this very law is
                                made to protect.” But it does hold in all other circumstances. For
                                instance, a Frenchman, having taken advantage of the extraordinary
                                laxity of the Swiss naturalization laws, to become a Swiss citizen,
                                without even leaving France, for the evident purpose of divorcing,
                                the court decided that his naturalization would not be recognized to
                                the extent of giving validity to his divorce, though it would hold
                                good for all other purposes.</item>
                            <label>(3)</label>
                            <item>The naturalization may be admitted to be fully valid in France,
                                but only from the moment it was legally obtained and with no
                                retroactive effect. Thus, a Frenchman who becomes naturalized abroad
                                is admitted to be a foreigner, but is held to account for having
                                failed to comply with the military laws of France, because this
                                offense necessarily preceded the change of nationality, which,
                                according to the French theory, is not to be recognized if made
                                before coming of age.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Having thus briefly explained the principles and theory of the French
                        legislation and policy in relation to the change of allegiance of French
                        citizens, I will now state what is the practice in such cases.</p>
                    <p>The son of every Frenchman is registered at the place of his birth, if born
                        in France, or at the place of his family’s residence if born abroad, as
                        liable to military service. This registration forms in each commune a
                        recruiting list, which is drawn up every year by the mayor, who afterwards
                        sends it to the prefecture of the department, where it is combined with all
                        the other lists in a general one, comprising all men belonging to the
                        department born twenty years before. When the time comes each person
                        registered on that list is notified to present himself at a designated
                        place. If residing abroad, this notice is served upon him through his consul
                        or through his parents and relatives residing in France. If he fails to
                        report himself when called upon, he is charged with being an <hi
                            rend="italic">insoumis</hi>, a peculiar offense known in French law as
                        the offense of “insubmission” (<hi rend="italic">délit d’insoumission</hi>),
                        and his name and description are given to the police authorities with the
                        order to arrest him when found.</p>
                    <p>A Frenchman naturalized abroad is sure to be arrested when he comes to
                        France, if his name is recorded on the recruiting list of his commune or
                        department, and it is sure to be thus recorded if he has not performed his
                        military service or if he has not been regularly exempted from that service
                        for some particular cause. If he opposes no resistance, he is generally
                        dealt with gently, otherwise he is handcuffed and roughly treated. The
                        police deliver him to the military authorities of the department, where he
                        is charged with being an “<hi rend="italic">insoumis</hi>” and where a
                        court-martial proceeds to try him upon that charge. He pleads that he has
                        renounced his original nationality, that he is now a foreigner—generally an
                        American or Swiss citizen—and that as such he is not liable to military
                        service in France. To this plea the court-martial usually replies that it is
                        not competent to pass upon questions of nationality, that such questions
                        belong to the jurisdiction of the civil courts, to which the defendant must
                        appeal, and it suspends its action until it is informed of the result of
                        such appeal. While this appeal is pending, the defendant, as a rule, is left
                        temporarily at liberty. If he is imprisoned, and the fact brought to the
                        notice of the legation, a request addressed to the minister of foreign
                        affairs, or to the minister of war, or to the general commanding the
                        department, should the case be urgent, generally secures release on
                        parole.</p>
                    <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0279"/>
                    <p>The case is brought before the civil court by summoning the prefect of the
                        department, who is responsible for the preparation of the recruiting list,
                        to erase from that list the name of the defendant. The documentary evidence
                        necessary to establish a case are an American passport and a certificate of
                        naturalization, accompanied by a French certificate from this legation
                        describing the contents of the naturalization papers and vouching for their
                        authenticity. If the defendant happens to be born in the United States he
                        must also produce a certificate of his birth, written in French or
                        translated by a sworn translator, and duly legalized either by a French
                        consul in the United States or by this legation.</p>
                    <p>If his father has acquired American citizenship, it is well that he should
                        produce, besides, a certificate of his father’s naturalization.</p>
                    <p>Upon the production of such evidence the French courts of justice render a
                        judgment declaring that the defendant having ceased to be a French citizen
                        cannot be held to perform military service in the French army, which, by the
                        law, is entirely composed of Frenchmen. The defendant then goes back to the
                        council of war, where his name is definitively erased from the French
                        military rolls. The court nevertheless tries him for the offense of
                        insubmission committed before he could have legally thrown off his original
                        allegiance. If three years have elapsed since the day he was fully
                        naturalized he benefits by the statute of limitation and is discharged. If
                        he has not been naturalized for such period he falls under the action of the
                        law punishing insubmission, and is sentenced to a fine or to a few weeks’ or
                        months’ imprisonment, perhaps to both, according to the circumstances of the
                        case.</p>
                    <p>If the defendant has resided abroad only a few years; if he took out his
                        naturalization papers only a short time before returning to his native
                        place; if, in short, he seems to have left France and to have renounced his
                        original nationality for no other purpose than avoiding military service,
                        the sentence is as severe as it can be. If on the contrary the defendant has
                        been residing a long time abroad; if there are reasons to warrant the belief
                        that he truly expatriated himself and became in good faith and with good
                        intent a citizen of another country, the sentence is as light as possible;
                        sometimes there is none at all, and the defendant is discharged without fine
                        or punishment.</p>
                    <p>Whether punished or not, the defendant, when he is released by the military
                        authorities, is not at the end of his troubles. He is now turned over to the
                        civil authorities, who in dealing with him are guided by the same rules
                        which governed the military councils. If he is supposed to be a <hi
                            rend="italic">bona fide</hi> foreign citizen, he is not interfered with;
                        if he is suspected of having acquired his foreign citizenship to escape
                        military service, he is at once expelled from France.</p>
                    <p>I must say that nine times out of ten an order of expulsion awaits the
                        Frenchman naturalized abroad who ventures to come to France before having
                        performed his military service. The interposition of the legation in such
                        cases is useless. The French Government is very sensitive on this point, and
                        will listen to no request tending to allow one who has averted military
                        service by placing himself under a foreign flag to remain unmolested, and
                        apparently in defiance of the French military laws, in the midst of those
                        who are rigorously held to obey them. We have occasionally obtained a short
                        extension of the time allowed for leaving France. We have never secured the
                        revocation of an order of expulsion issued under such circumstances. As an
                        example I can cite the case of Lacazette.</p>
                    <p>Lacazette was an American citizen of French origin, who, after having <pb
                            n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0280"/>obtained the erasure of his name
                        from the French recruiting list, was ordered to leave France before a fixed
                        date. Lacazette being in bad health, Mr. Morton, at his request, asked that
                        he be allowed to delay his departure for five months; the French Government
                        replied that the request could not be granted because there were objections
                        to the presence of Lacazette in his country of origin. (See inclosure
                        1.)</p>
                    <p>With the hope of relieving some of our American citizens of French origin of
                        the trouble, expense, and mortification of having to appear before military
                        councils and civil courts to establish their rights, we attempted in several
                        cases to notify the French Government that persons born in the United
                        States, or who had been naturalized there, were American citizens, and asked
                        that their names be erased from the French military rolls; but the French
                        Government declines to accept such notification, and replies invariably that
                        those who are claimed by France as natural-born citizens can be dispensed
                        with the military obligations imposed upon them only by procuring from the
                        French Government the authorization to change their nationality, or by
                        obtaining from a French court of justice a judgment declaring that they have
                        lost their French character.</p>
                    <p>Two recent cases, those of Aubry and of Jacob, are good illustrations of the
                        attitude taken by the French Government when applications of the kind above
                        referred to are made to it. Aubry was a young Frenchman naturalized in New
                        York in 1882. Mr. Morton sent to the minister of foreign-affairs a duplicate
                        of his certificate of naturalization, with the request that it be
                        communicated to the military authorities in order that he might not be
                        troubled by them. M. Challemel Lacour returned the certificate, with the
                        simple statement that Aubry not having applied for the authorization to
                        change his allegiance, the minister of war cannot erase his name from the
                        French military rolls. (See inclosure 2.)</p>
                    <p>The case of Jacob, one of the most extraordinary on record in this legation,
                        is still more striking.</p>
                    <p>Jacob was a natural-born American citizen, but his father was French at the
                        time of his birth. Having come to France he was incorporated in the army.
                        The legation remonstrated and asked that he be discharged. The French
                        Government replied that it had no authority for so doing; that in France all
                        questions of nationality were to be settled by the courts, and that Jacob
                        had no other resource but to appeal to their decision. He did not do so, and
                        after serving out his time, he returned home and applied to the Department
                        to take steps to have his name definitively struck off the French military
                        rolls. The French Government declined to do so on the ground that Jacob
                        being the son of a Frenchman was also French, although born in the United
                        States, and could therefore be released from his military obligations
                        towards France only if a judgment of a court of justice declares that he has
                        lost his French character, or by his acquiring American citizenship after
                        having obtained from France the permission for so doing, a permission which
                        the minister of war is willing to give. (See note of M. Waddington to
                        General Noyes, inclosure to dispatch of Mr. Morton No. 494, and note of Mr.
                        Ferry to Mr. Norton, dispatch No. 555.)</p>
                    <p>In fact the legation is powerless during the whole stage of the proceedings
                        instituted against a naturalized American citizen of French origin who has
                        failed to comply with the military laws of France. We cannot prevent him
                        from being arrested upon his arrival in France; we cannot prevent his trial
                        for insubmission; we cannot prevent his being fined and imprisoned$ and
                        finally, we cannot prevent his expulsion. <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181"
                            facs="0281"/>Almost the only thing that we can do is to see that under
                        no consideration whatever an American citizen be compelled to perform
                        military service in the French army, but this is a thing seldom attempted
                        because it is contrary to French law.</p>
                    <p>Is there any remedy for this state of things? I fear not, because I do not
                        believe the French Government will consent to make an agreement, or to come
                        to a distinct understanding upon this subject, the terms of which would
                        precisely inform French citizens desirous of evading the military laws of
                        France as to what they had to do to attain their object. The present
                        uncertainty of things creates fears and entertains apprehensions which deter
                        many from resorting to a change of allegiance to avoid military service.
                        Something, however, ought to be attempted to protect American citizens of
                        French origin against the vexations to which they are exposed when they
                        return to France. The position assumed by the French Government, that in
                        France it belongs only to the courts of justice to pass upon questions of
                        personal status and consequently of nationality, is undoubtedly sound in
                        principle; but it does not seem that it can be maintained when the question
                        to decide is whether military service is due or not.</p>
                    <p>Courts of justice are instituted to settle contested or doubtful questions.
                        When the United States Government declares that a man is an American
                        citizen, the matter is settled; in claiming him we furnish to the French
                        Government the best of -all evidence of his foreign citizenship. In a case
                        established in such a manner there remains nothing doubtful 5 nothing which
                        can be contested nothing for a court to decide upon. If the French
                        Government contended that naturalizations of this class, although valid
                        abroad, might not be recognized in France, the case would be different, for
                        there would be an object in subjecting these naturalizations to the courts;
                        but no such right is claimed, nor can be claimed, because the Frenchman who
                        states that he has become the citizen of another country, and who is
                        recognized as such by that country, is, in the very eye of the French law, a
                        foreigner. The formality of compelling those who claim exemption from
                        military service to establish their foreign citizenship before a court of
                        justice is, therefore, a useless and empty one.</p>
                    <p>The French Government needs not the judgment of a court of justice to exempt
                        from military service the Frenchman who has thrown off his original
                        allegiance. The law says that the Frenchman who has been guilty of this act
                        is no more fit to perform military service. It is undoubtedly the duty of
                        the Government to see that it is executed, and when it chooses it does. The
                        mayors of the communes where the local recruiting lists are prepared; the
                        prefect of the department where these lists are combined in one; the general
                        in command to whom this final list is sent, and the minister of war, have
                        each the authority arid power to erase the name of those who are
                        disqualified from military service. Without going further than this
                        legation, I find evidence of the use of that power. In 1883 a natural-born
                        Frenchman, Mr. John B. Foichat, who had acquired American citizenship, came
                        to France, where he was arrested and confined in prison for a few days. Upon
                        receiving evidence of his American citizenship the general commanding the
                        department ordered his discharge, and he was liberated without having to
                        appear before any court of justice. (See Mr. Morton’s dispatch No. 651.)</p>
                    <p>Were we to ask the French Government to dispense with this troublesome,
                        expensive, and useless formality of appealing to courts of justice to
                        establish the citizenship of Americans of French origin, which is already
                        established as well as it can be, by their papers, we would not <pb n="182"
                            xml:id="pg_182" facs="0282"/>be asking anything contrary to the existing
                        laws, or anything that the French Government has not heretofore occasionally
                        granted. This is so true that in 1866 Mr. Drouyn de Lhuys himself suggested
                        to Mr. Bigelow that a Frenchman, naturalized in the United States and liable
                        to military service in France, should report himself at once to the mayor of
                        the place where he is registered on the recruiting list and ask, after
                        producing evidence of his naturalization, to have his name stricken
                        therefrom. (Foreign Relations, 1866, I, 301.)</p>
                    <p>As the French Government cannot apply the law punishing “insubmission or
                        disobedience” to those who have been naturalized for more than three years,
                        because they are protected by the statute of limitation, and as it will
                        certainly not renounce the application of that law whenever possible, we
                        might ask that only those who are plainly covered by the statute of
                        limitation be freed from seeking by any judicial process exemption from
                        military service.</p>
                    <p>To effect this object a certificate somewhat similar to the one issued by the
                        British Government to their subjects born in France (see inclosure 3) could
                        be delivered, either by the Department or by this legation, to Americans of
                        French origin applying for it, who have been naturalized for at least three
                        years. The certificate would state that fact, and the mayors and prefects
                        would be instructed, as they are now with reference to British subjects born
                        in France, not to inscribe on the recruiting lists, or if already
                        registered, to erase from such lists the names of those producing such
                        certificate.</p>
                    <p>I have no reason to believe that the French Government will assent to such an
                        arrangement; I even fear it will not; but as it is a fair and reasonable
                        one, and as it would relieve many of our adopted citizens from unnecessary
                        trouble, I think it ought to be proposed, and if the Department authorizes
                        the legation to make an effort in that direction I have no doubt Mr. Morton
                        will cheerfully do so.</p>
                    <p>In the mean time I venture to suggest that naturalized Americans of French
                        origin who have not complied with the military laws of France, should in
                        some manner be warned of the difficulties and vexatious which await them in
                        their mother country, if they happen to return there, and informed of the
                        steps to be taken to avoid or lessen these difficulties.</p>

                        for its unusual length,</p>

                            to receive a letter from you upon the subject of Eugene Lacazette, a
                            naturalized American citizen, who, as such alter obtaining the erasure
                            of his name from the recuiting list was notified to leave France before
                            the 17th of July. This young man expressed a desire to be allowed, on
                            account of his health, to delay his departure for five months.</p>
                        <p>I promptly communicated this request to the minister of the interior.
                            After a careful inquiry, Mr. René Goblet informed me that because of the
                            circumstances which accompanied the liberation of M. Lacazette, and the
                            inconvenience that his presence in his country of origin offered, it did
                            not appear possible to authorize him to remain upon our territory for a
                            longer term than the one assigned to him.</p>

                            Julien Aubry, born on the 3d of February, 1856, at Cirey
                            (Meurthe-et-Moselle), a young soldier of the class of 1876.</p>
                        <p>The minister of war, to whom my predecessor did not omit to forward this
                            document, informs me that according to information obtained from the

                            regard to which correspondence has taken place between Mr. Outrey, Mr.
                            Roustan, and this Department, and which I hold to fall within the
                            principle agreed to by the two Governments in the case of Isaac Taylor
                            against the Republic of France, pursuant to which the cases of Taylor
                            and others were withdrawn from the Commission by this Government, and
                            various eases against the United States were afterwards withdrawn by the
                            agent of France.</p>
                        <p>The case of G. A. Le More and Company <hi rend="italic">vs</hi>. The
                            United States, No. 211 on the docket of the Commission, is founded upon
                            the following facts:</p>
                        <p>The claimants allege that they owned a large number of bales of cotton,
                            situated in Louisiana, which were seized by the fleet under Admiral
                            Porter and taken to Cairo. Thereafter judicial proceedings were begun in
                            the district court of the United States, and the case was carried on
                            appeal to its ultimate resort in the Supreme Court of the United States,
                                <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0284"/>the decision in each
                            instance being adverse to the interests of the Messrs. Le More.</p>
                        <p>While the proceeding was in the nature of an action <hi rend="italic">in
                                rem</hi>, it is a well-known fact, and appears in the records of
                            this Department and of the court, that the claimants were represented by
                            counsel at every stage.</p>
                        <p>While the case was still pending the representatives of the French
                            Government in Washington, and the Messrs. Le More directly, endeavored
                            to obtain a consideration of their claim by this Department, This
                            request was uniformly declined, and it was held that the claimants
                            should first exhaust their legal remedies before appealing to diplomatic
                            action. After the case had been decided in the Supreme Court, a motion
                            for a rehearing was made by the claimants’ counsel on the ground of an
                            alleged error in the record prejudicial to the claimants’ rights, which
                            motion was refused; and a subsequent request having been made to this
                            Department to reconsider the case diplomatically on the ground of a
                            failure of justice to the parties, an adverse decision was rendered as
                            nothing was found in the proceedings authorizing a recourse to the
                            executive branch of the Government.</p>
                        <p>This claim, therefore, does not differ in principle from that of Taylor,
                            and, in fact, it appears even more clearly to have been finally disposed
                            of judicially by competent authority.</p>
                        <p>The claim of Mr. Taylor was founded upon the seizure by a French cruiser
                            of petroleum owned by him laden upon a German vessel called the
                            Magdalena, and Mr. Outrey in his note of November 18, 1881, says: <quote

                                <p>Now, during the negotiation of the convention of 1880, it was
                                    well understood that neither of the contracting parties would
                                    consent to any revision of decisions pronounced within its
                                    territory by competent authorities in any form whatever. In
                                    order to meet such a case Article II formally and explicitly
                                    provides that the Commission shall not decide any claim that
                                    either Government has already caused to be settled either
                                    diplomatically, <hi rend="italic">judicially, or otherwise by
                                        competent authorities</hi>. According to our view the case
                                    of the Magdalena has been judicially settled, since it has been
                                    passed upon by two bodies invested with judicial powers. I am
                                    aware that different doctrines have been laid down with regard
                                    to the weight to be attached to the decisions of prize courts;
                                    it does not seem to me, however, that this is a proper time for
                                    the discussion of those doctrines, for even admitting, for the
                                    moment, that the case of the Magdalena is not to be considered
                                    as having been judicially decided, it cannot be denied that it
                                    comes under the head of those which have been otherwise decided
                                    by competent authorities.</p>

                        <p>Pursuant to the agreement thus arrived at, several cases have been
                            withdrawn. But while the case of Le More and Co. was some time since
                            brought to the attention of Mr. Roustan, and while I understood that our
                            views harmonized, and while several conventions have taken place with
                            regard to it, it appears to be still pending before the Commission, and
                            I am now informed that that body purposes to force it to trial,
                            notwithstanding the negotiations which have taken place and the further
                            negotiations which are now pending. The case is clearly one which has
                            been disposed of by a competent tribunal. It has been decided in regular
                            gradation by the inferior courts of the United States, and by its
                            highest court of final resort. This is not denied, and while it has been
                            contended in conversation that the Supreme Court had not jurisdiction of
                            the case, a conclusive answer to this assertion is found in the fact
                            that the very point was made before the court, and the court in terms
                            and expressly decided that it had jurisdiction over the case. This
                            decision cannot but be regarded as final; and as, to quote Mr. Outrey’s
                            words, “during the negotiation of the convention of 1880 it was well
                            understood that neither of the contracting parties would consent to any
                            revision of decisions pronounced within its territory by competent
                            authorities, in any form whatever,” and as the case of Le More has been
                            judicially settled, since it has been passed upon by three bodies
                            invested with judicial powers, I have to request that the agent on
                            behalf of the Republic of France before the French-American Commission
                            be instructed to withdraw this claim from the consideration of that

                            commerce, revoked the decree of February 18, 1881, which prohibited the
                            importation of salt pork from the United States.</p>
                        <p>In adopting this measure the Government of the Republic was influenced

                            between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>However, in compliance with a wish expressed by the Chamber of Deputies
                            in consequence of an interpellation which took place during the session
                            of December 22, the French Government has been obliged to suspend for

                        <p>In informing me of this fact, the president of the council adds that a
                            bill has been introduced in the Chamber which is designed to regulate
                            the importation of salt pork from the United States, and that the
                            Government will hasten the discussion of this bill as much as

                            Mr. Frelinghuysen in relation to the claim brought against the United
                            States by Mr. Le More, a French citizen, and laid before the mixed
                            commission sitting at Washington. The honorable Secretary of State of
                            the United States desired that the decision of this claim should be
                            postponed, in order that the two Governments might thus be enabled to
                            decide whether it was not proper for it to be withdrawn, according to
                            Article II of the treaty of 1880.</p>
                        <p>With a view to complying with this desire, I at once telegraphed to our
                            commissioner at Washington not to oppose the desired postponement. It
                            appears, however, from Mr. Lefaivre’s reply, that, by a unanimous
                            decision, after a formal deliberation, the Commission ordered, on the
                            19th of December, that Mr. Le More’s case should be submitted to it on
                            the 28th instant. This decision, in which the American commissioner
                            acquiesced, as did also the Brazilian commissioner, evidently changes
                            the condition of the question; to the doubts which existed, and which
                            should have inured to the benefit of the claimant, it adds a
                            presumption, and, as it were, a kind of acquired right, of the benefit
                            of which it does not seem possible to deprive him. It does not appear,
                            moreover, by what right one of the two Governments could interfere in
                            order to cause the postponement of a decision adopted by the commission,
                            which alone has power to decide upon the order in which its work is to
                            be performed. In this state of things, it has seemed proper to me to
                            allow the proceedings to take their own course, the Commission being
                            theproper judge of the question whether Mr. Le More’s claim should be
                            withdrawn for a reason based upon Article II of the treaty of 1880,
                            which is the law by which it is governed. I will thank you to inform Mr.
                            Frelinghuysen of the reasons which have prevented me from complying with
                            his request.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary of State</hi>: After the receipt of
                            the communications which you addressed to this legation on the 27th
                            ultimo and the 7th instant, relative to the Le More case, I had a
                            conversation on Tuesday last with the Assistant Secretary of State, to
                            whom I communicated a letter written by the president of the council to
                            Mr. Morton, on the 27th ultimo, in which the reasons were stated why M.
                            Jules Ferry deemed it to be his duty to leave the question to be decided
                            by the Claims Commission.</p>
                        <p>Mr. John Davis made several observations to me on this subject,
                            especially with regard to the scope which M. Ferry seemed inclined to
                            give to the decision of the Commission, bearing date of the 19th ultimo,
                            which put the case on the docket for the 28th of that month, and he
                            insisted that the French Government should consent to having this case
                            postponed by the Commission, and that the negotiations should be resumed
                            which took place between us last summer, and at the conclusion of which
                            I addressed a report to my Government relative to the Le More claim.</p>
                        <p>I telegraphed a report of that conversation to Paris, and I now have the
                            honor to communicate to you the reply which I have received on this
                            subject.</p>
                        <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0288"/>
                        <p>The president of the council informs me that the observations presented
                            by the United States Government, which are reproduced in my report of
                            last year, have not dispelled the doubts which exist in the mind of the
                            French Government as to whether Mr. Le More’s claim should be considered
                            as having been previously settled.</p>
                        <p>The president of the council, thinking that the claimant ought to have
                            the benefit of the doubt, does not consider that it would be proper for
                            him to deprive M. Le More of the last resort that remains to him. He
                            thinks that under these circumstances, and in view of the difference of
                            opinion on this subject between the two Governments, it is proper to
                            leave it to the mixed commission to decide the question by examining
                            thoroughly, according to Article II of the treaty of 1880, whether M. Le
                            More’s claim should be decided by it (the mixed commission).</p>
                        <p>I trust, Mr. Secretary of State, that this method of settlement, which
                            leaves the principle of the matter intact, will secure the adhesion of
                            the United States Government.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The spectre of communism ever rises in Europe,
                        however wise and well directed the measures to keep it down. Its nihilistic
                        forms in Russia startle the Government and community by crimes of peculiar
                        atrocity. In Austria and France it is manifested by workingmen’s plots and
                        agitations; in Spain it calls itself republican and honeycombs the army.
                        There is less manifestation of socialism in Germany, partly because the
                        Government is peculiarly vigilant, and partly because the German character
                        is more patient than that of most other peoples. But it must be admitted
                        that the privations of the lower classes in some parts of the Empire are
                        very great, and their lot comparatively hopeless. It is very hard for an
                        artisan or laborer, unless gifted with peculiar genius, to rise above the
                        station assigned by his birth, and the most gifted by nature has to struggle
                        against obstacles almost insurmountable.</p>
                    <p>It is difficult to fix a blame for this condition of things; perhaps any
                        blame would be unjust. The Empire is overpopulated; the soil is inferior in
                        a large part; landed property is held tightly under entail, etc.; the public
                        service is difficult to enter without advantages of birth and influence, and
                        can only be entered in youth, and after a preparation only possible to
                        leisure and comparatively easy circumstances; the condition of Europe
                        necessitates a large army, with consequent large taxation. All these facts
                        and others tend to keep poor the poor; and the wisest and most disinterested
                        statemanship may be powerless to remedy them. In many of these conditions
                        Germany is not worse off than some of its neighbors, while, in the peace and
                        good order which reign in it, it has an advantage.</p>
                    <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0289"/>
                    <p>For a long time the imperial chancellor seems to have been impressed with the
                        idea that it is possible to remedy some of the evils of poverty by
                        legislation, and to remove discontent among the workers of the Empire by
                        making them obvious participators in its material benefits. The humanity of
                        this idea cannot be challenged. Perhaps the future will realize it in some
                        form. The readjustment of the relations of labor and capital; the
                        equalization of conditions in life; the tendency of modern civilizations to
                        accumulate great wealth in the hands of the few; the growth of monopolies;
                        the effects of education upon the masses, with the new wants thus created;
                        the possibility of eliminating vice and improvidence, and the general effect
                        upon the progress of society and upon individual exertion of measures that
                        will tend to more equally distribute wealth and comfort; all these and
                        kindred problems may soon be forced upon the minds of statesmen, not merely
                        by the uncalculating violence of communist factions, which would erect
                        guillotines and cast lots to part the garments of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >bourgeois</hi>; but also by the great facts of uncomplaining and
                        hopeless misery, which are made more intolerable by the progress of
                        enlightenment. In the mediæval age the priest taught his ignorant hearer
                        that God assigned to man his lot, some to honor and some to dishonor, and it
                        was rebellion against Him to murmur. Different theories prevail now in the
                        average mind, and misery is not relieved even by the consciousness of
                        obedience to Divine will.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the chancellor is in advance of his time in endeavoring to form a
                        body of laws that shall relieve poverty of some of its evils. Perhaps he is
                        wiser than those who advocate a <hi rend="italic">laisser aller</hi> course.
                        In my No. 141, of April 19, 1883, I gave a sketch of the chancellor’s
                        project for a workingman’s accident insurance law, which subsequently failed
                        in the Reichstag. One element of that bill that led to much opposition was
                        the provision for part payment of indemnities by the state. It was insisted
                        that the bill provided no adequate fund out of which such payments could be
                        made. The new bill of the chancellor has been published, occupying a dozen
                        closely printed columns in the official newspaper, and is a marvel of
                        organization. Certainly no people other than the Germans, who are noted for
                        organizing power, could put such a law into execution; and I should doubt if
                        such wheels within wheels could work under any superintendence. The bill
                        contemplates the organization of all the labor givers in the German Empire
                        into insurance companies, according to the nature of their several trades or
                        employments, with corporate rights. These organizations are to pay the whole
                        of the indemnity on the lives and limbs of their workmen; in proportion to
                        the wages earned by the latter and to the danger tariff. All the companies
                        will be under the supervision of an “imperial assurance board,” composed of
                        several permanent members to be appointed by the Emperor, of four
                        non-permanent ones to be appointed by the federal council, and as many of
                        the same kind to be elected by the companies and the workingmen’s
                        committees. These are the leading ideas of the bill, which is marvelously
                        constructed with its elaborate machinery. It is intended to realize in part
                        the proposition of the venerable Emperor, who recommended, in his memorable
                        special message to Parliament of November 17, 1881, that something be done
                        to ameliorate the condition of the poor, and thus to strike at the roots of
                        social disaffection.</p>
                    <p>The bill is now before the federal council, and will be laid before the
                        Reichstag at the March session. It has more chance of passage than its
                        predecessor. Its degree of success as a law, will be a curious study. The
                        labor employers will be least enthusiastic over its provisions. Complaint
                            <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0290"/>is made of the sharpness of
                        competition against German fabrics. The effect of the bill in increasing the
                        cost of production is to be observed. But the principal question really is,
                        if such a partial measure will satisfy the socialists, who clamor against
                        the wealthy classes, denounce property as robbery, and ask not for a
                        pittance in case of accident or death, but the cutting off of the
                        capitalists, great and small, and for a community of goods. These extremist
                        views are fundamental, with the socialist agitators and adherents, if they
                        may be judged by their utterances. If such really be their ideas, it may be
                        doubted if so small a sop will for a moment divert the Cerberus.</p>

                        threaten to draft him into the army, notwithstanding the fact that he
                        possesses a passport which was issued to him by this Department on the 18th
                        of May, 1882.</p>
                    <p>In view of the statements contained in Mr. Hamburger’s letter, I will thank
                        you to make inquiries in regard to the case of Mr. Stern, and to take such
                        action as you may deem proper for the protection of his rights as an
                        American citizen.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hamburger states that Mr. Stern will probably desire to remain in Germany
                        beyond the period of two years, for the purpose of closing up his father’s
                        estate. Mr. Hamburger has been informed that Mr. Stern’s right, under
                        Article IV of the Bancroft treaty, to receive protection, thereafter, as an
                        American citizen will depend upon his <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>
                        intention to retain American citizenship, and that this is a question which
                        can only be settled by the facts of each individual case as it arises.</p>
                    <p>Should Mr. Stern, therefore, make application for a renewal of his passport
                        at the expiration of his two years’ residence in Germany, you will then
                        determine, from all the circumstances of his case, whether he is entitled to
                        have a new passport issued, and to further protection as an American
                        citizen.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: Mr. Oscar Stern came to the city of
                            New York some fourteen years ago, under the age of eighteen years, and
                            in due course of time became a naturalized citizen of the United States.
                            He continued to live in this city until some time in June, <pb n="191"
                                xml:id="pg_191" facs="0291"/>1882, when he was called to his former
                            home, Zweibrücken, Germany, to assist in winding up the estate of his
                            deceased father. Your Department granted him a passport on the 18th day
                            of May, 1882, which is numbered 2207. Mr. Stern has never given up his
                            residence in this country, but, by reason of the circumstances above
                            referred to, has been compelled to remain in Zweibrücken, inasmuch as
                            the estate has not been fully wound up.</p>
                        <p>The German Government now propose to draft him in the regular army,
                            claiming that more than two years having elapsed since the granting of
                            the passport, he not having attained the age of thirty-one years, is
                            subject to military duty for one year, to wit, until he arrives at
                            thirty-one years of age, which will be March 18, 1885. I would
                            respectfully ask you if the United States Government will not protect
                            Mr. Stern from such interference on the part of the German Government.
                            Mr. S. has sworn allegiance to the United States Government, and does
                            not intend to become a resident of Germany; on the contrary, expects to
                            permanently live in this country as soon as he can wind up his father’s
                            estate.</p>
                        <p>I would be obliged for information on this subject, so that I may
                            communicate the same at an early day to Mr. Stern.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose, with translation,
                        a copy of the speech from the throne, delivered on the 6th instant, by Mr.
                        Von Böttecher, minister of the interior, neither the Emperor nor the
                        chancellor being present. The ceremony of opening the session of the
                        Reichstag was, as usual, in the White Hall of the old castle. * * *</p>
                    <p>The session of the legislative body in its own hall commenced almost
                        immediately after. The customary deference had been paid to the sovereign of
                        repairing to his ancient palace to listen to his message, before any
                        legislative act. The present is the last session of this Reichstag.</p>
                    <p>The message contains no surprises. After the usual words of welcome, it is
                        stated that the most important task of the session will be found in the
                        domain of social-political legislation. To that legislation I have referred
                        somewhat at length in my No. 231, of January 18, and find the message
                        follows the lines I then predicted. For an official statement of the motives
                        and hopes of the Imperial Government from these unusual measures, the
                        message deserves an attentive perusal. If I read its ultimate suggestions
                        correctly, these involve eventual absorption of the whole business of
                        insurance by the Government. The entire subject of this experimental
                        legislation is so interesting that I shall watch it carefully, and report
                        upon it from time to time.</p>
                    <p>The message speaks of copyrights, and art and pattern and model protecting
                        treaties, with Belgium. * * *</p>
                    <p>The contentment of His Majesty with the relations between the Empire and
                        foreign countries is stated, in view of the apprehensions and prophecies to
                        the contrary after the “reconstruction of the German Empire called in
                        question the peaceful character of its policy.” A similar regard for peace
                        is believed to animate the neighboring friendly powers. Particular reference
                        is made to the Russian and Austrian courts, with whom “inherited friendship”
                        has been strengthened, and the gratifying reception of the crown prince in
                        Italy and Spain is pleasantly alluded <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192"
                            facs="0292"/>to as evidence of the respect in which Germany is held
                        abroad. The Emperor counts upon maintaining confidence in Germany abroad and
                        peace at home.</p>
                    <p>The message is merely confirmatory of other evidences that the policy of
                        Germany looks toward continental peace, and that the court of Russia is
                        desirous of peace with Germany. A recent Russian mission to Berlin brought
                        the congratulations of the Czar to the Emperor William on the seventieth
                        anniversary of his gaining the Russian Cross of St. George, when he charged
                        with a Russian regiment against the French at Bar-sur-Aube. The deputation
                        was received with great distinction, and their visit could but be a
                        gratification to the military hero whose early exploit it recalled. While
                        the near approach of Russia and Germany during the past few months, and the
                        appreciative words of the message, do not necessarily imply such a treaty as
                        that of the latter with Austria, they show the renewal of friendly relations
                        between the two courts, and are a public assertion of the same. Despite some
                        rumors to the contrary, I have steadily been inclined to believe that the
                        two Governments would avoid war if possible; and the antagonism between the
                        two peoples, especially that of the Slavonic races against Germans, would be
                        the impelling cause if war ever came. * * *</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have thought it best to call your attention
                        to the following case where I have felt compelled to refuse to intervene
                        with the German Government for a person who apparently considers himself
                        entitled to my good offices, as an American citizen, though he does not
                        bring proper proof that he is a citizen of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Friedrich Breidenstein, a native of Germany, emigrated to the United
                        States, with his family, on the 12th August, 1854, took out his first, or
                        intention, paper, on the 22d August, 1855, and died there the same year,
                        before he had time to become an American citizen. His son, Henry, returned
                        with his mother to Germany in August, 1857, remained there till the 30th of
                        March, 1860, and then again went to America with his mother, and has
                        apparently remained there ever since as a resident of Rockton, Wis. When he,
                        the said Henry Breidenstein, came of age, he applied to his guardian in
                        Germany, Johannes Wollenhaupt, for his share of his father’s estate in
                        Germany, and was informed in reply that the German Government had retained
                        50 thalers of the same as a fine for his not having performed military
                        duty.</p>
                    <p>So matters appear to have been left for ten years, until last November, when
                        Henry Breidenstein, through his uncle, Heinrich Heinrich, asked me to do
                        what I could for him; to which I replied, on the 3d of December, suggesting
                        to him to obtain certificates of his own or his father’s citizenship at the
                        time the fine was paid. In reply I received a letter from C. D. Heinrich, a
                        cousin, the uncle having in the meantime died, inclosing a copy of the
                        father’s intention paper, and suggesting that as the son came to the United
                        States as a minor, he became on that <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0293"
                        />account an American citizen at twenty-one years of age, which appears to
                        be a not unusual impression among citizens of foreign birth. According to
                        previous decisions in similar cases, the German Government declines to
                        refund fines which were actually paid before the person fined became an
                        American citizen, though judgments of fine and attachments on inheritances
                        of absentees often expire by limitation where the persons do not return for
                        some years nor the children ask to have their estates divided. It is not
                        stated when the injunction was first laid on the Breidenstein estate, but if
                        the young man had waited a few years longer than he did to claim his share
                        of the estate, it is probable, from the analogy of other cases, that he
                        would not have had to pay this fine at all. As it is, I am satisfied that,
                        as his father died without becoming an American citizen, and the son does
                        not appear to have availed himself of the benefit of section 2168 of the
                        naturalization law previous to his coming of age and to the division of the
                        estate, if he ever has done so, any intervention in his behalf would be
                        quite fruitless, and have so written him.</p>
                    <p>The case is important as involving a principle adopted by the German
                        Government and heretofore tacitly admitted by our own, and in this light I
                        should be glad to know that my course is approved.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I find an article in the Berliner Tageblatt of
                        the 23d instant, which I translate below, which shows that the German
                        Government is at last on the track of the real danger in the consumption of
                        pork, and earnestly recommends by circular to the people through cooking to
                        “exclude all danger of deleterious results.” The circular gives the
                        statistics of sickness and death at Emersleben, and other places, and is
                        very impressive in its statements. There can be no doubt that if the advice
                        thus given is followed, all danger from the consumption of any pork will be
                        removed.</p>

                                circular note, according to the “Magdeburger Gazette,” was last
                                month addressed to all provincial administrations, as well as to the
                                Berlin police presidency, in which, after giving statistical reports
                                upon the epidemic, it renews the warning against the unwholesome and
                                often fatal practice of eating raw pork. The meat of a single pig
                                killed on the 12th September last at Emersleben caused the terrible
                                epidemic there, as well as at Deesdorf and Nienhagen, and which
                                produced the death of 66 persons out of 503 cases of disease. Of
                                these, 270 cases, with 53 deaths, fell to Emersleben; 45, and 10
                                deaths, to Deesdorf; and 80, with 1 death, to Nienhagen. Besides, 4
                                cases and 2 deaths were reported from Grönigen, 3 cases in the
                                convent at Grönigen, and 1 case at Schwanbeck. In this connection it
                                is worthy of note that all persons who consumed 125 grams of raw
                                pork invariably died, and that all the deceased had, as was
                                discovered, eaten the pork raw—a practice largely indulged in in the
                                province of Saxony. Whether and to what degree the meat inspectors
                                in question are responsible for the fatal accident, has not yet been
                                ascertained. <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0294"/>In view of
                                these sad events, the ministry of education, &amp;c., considered it
                                of vital importance to repeatedly and earnestly warn the public
                                against the consumption of raw pork. It therefore considers it
                                appropriate to advise that in preparing pork for food, it be
                                thoroughly boiled or roasted, and thereby exclude all danger of
                                deleterious results. The authorities are to adopt the necessary
                                measures to this end.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your No. 198, of March 6, 1884,
                        received March 21, in regard to the case of Mr. Oscar Stern (or Stein), who
                        is said to be in Germany to aid in the settlement of his father’s estate,
                        and whom the authorities threaten to draft in the army, I beg leave to
                        remark that immediately upon the receipt of your said instruction I caused a
                        letter to be written to said person, directed to Zweibrücken, inclosing to
                        Mm one of our military case forms, requesting him to fill, it up and return
                        it to us, so far as the questions it contained were pertinent to his case,
                        and that he transmit to me his citizen paper and any papers the German
                        authorities might have served upon him, and sent to him also a copy of the
                        treaty of 1868, directing his attention especially to article 4 and the
                        power of the Bavarian authorities thereunder. To this fetter, which was sent
                            <hi rend="italic">poste restante</hi>, no reply has come, and so much
                        time has elapsed it has probably not reached the person intended. An answer
                        to the question in the military case form is necessary to present a case
                        satisfactorily to the foreign office, and it is also needful to send in the
                        complainant’s citizen papers. The slight particulars given in Mr.
                        Hamburger’s letter, a copy of which accompanies your instruction are of no
                        value for such a purpose, and do not even enable me to find the person most
                        interested. Had Mr. Hamburger directed Mr. Stern to address the legation
                        directly, I could have sifted the case at once and prepared to vindicate the
                        rights of Mr. Stern.</p>
                    <p>But Mr. Hamburger errs in the construction he puts upon the treaty. The
                        German authorities have not admitted the right of any citizen of the United
                        States of German birth to remain in this country longer than two years. They
                        are especially stringent in guarding against a more prolonged residence in
                        the cases of persons who are, like Stern, still of military age; probably
                        because they consider the example set by such persons to German youth to be
                        deleterious. On application from this legation, permission has usually been
                        granted for an extension of a few weeks, at most, for persons to leave the
                        country who have staid the two years; but this has been asked and granted as
                        a favor. The “<hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> intention” of the party
                        involved to leave in the third or fourth or other year is not inquired into
                        or admitted by the German Government to be of weight. It is the apparent
                        aim, observable from the study of the whole body of cases, to limit
                        residence of persons of military age to the treaty term.</p>
                    <p>With regard to persons who have passed the military age the practice is
                        somewhat variable, though as a rule such persons are not molested, where
                        they have an apparent ability to provide for their own support, and
                        consequently there are thousands of naturalized Germans <pb n="195"
                            xml:id="pg_195" facs="0295"/>in Germany, who have lived here for years,
                        without question. But the police sometimes seem to question the right of
                        this class to remain. During the past week Dr. G. W. Geist, a resident for
                        twelve years past of Frankfort-on-the-Main, practicing dentistry there, a
                        man who fought against the rebellion and is a naturalized American citizen,
                        called upon me and told me he had been verbally notified by the local police
                        to leave the country-in two months or to become a German citizen. In answer
                        to my questions he said he knew no cause for this notice; that he does not
                        interfere in political matters, pays his taxes, is a quiet man, has no known
                        enemies, does a good business as dentist, &amp;c., and intends to go to
                        America as soon as he has finished educating his children, who were born in
                        the United States, as well as his wife, and none of them are yet of military
                        age, the eldest lacking three years of it. I gave him a copy of the treaty
                        and advised him to write to the chief of police of his city inquiring if lie
                        had authorized such notice, and, if so, for the reasons therefor, promising
                        that I would be of any service to him that I could when I learned the
                        authority and motives for such notice. Unfortunately I can do little in such
                        a case, unless it be to get a little time to enable this man to save his
                        property and credit from entire sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>This case illustrates the hardships of our naturalization treaty. It is,
                        perhaps, the best that can be had, but the difference between the conduct of
                        the United States towards foreign residents in its midst and the treatment
                        of its citizens residing in Germany is in marked contrast. I am not able,
                        for want of more particulars, to pronounce absolutely upon Dr. Geist’s case;
                        but, taking his statement to be absolutely correct, it is hard to see the
                        propriety of the policy that excludes him so summarily from Germany. Where a
                        person between twenty-four and thirty-four, able-bodied, &amp;c., returns
                        here after naturalization, and insists on remaining, public or military
                        policy may see objections. But for a man of forty-seven years old, like Dr.
                        Geist, these objections do not exist, unless there is some extrinsic matter
                        in the case not revealed to me. I suppose Mr. Stern will present himself at
                        the legation when his passport expires, and my successor will observe still
                        farther your instructions.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report the refusal of a
                        passport on the ground of illegal naturalization of the applicant. The facts
                        are as follows:</p>
                    <p>On the 27th of February last the consul at Dresden forwarded the inclosed
                        duplicate passport application of Sigismund Jacoby, wife, and five children,
                        by which it appears that he was born in Prussia in 1844, emigrated in 1862,
                        at the age of eighteen, to the United States, and after a residence there of
                        only about four years was naturalized in the court of common pleas at New
                        York, on the 11th October, 1866, as appears by his citizen paper. As the
                        issue of a passport was refused by the minister without some satisfactory
                        explanation of the above statement, Mr. Jacoby came to Berlin and verbally
                        informed me that he was perfectly aware at the time he was naturalized that
                        he had been only four years in the United States, but that he was a member
                        of a political club, and at election time he was sworn in, with several
                        others, in order to vote, and supposed that the court knew what the law was.
                        He objected to having his papers taken from him, as he is about to return to
                        South America, where he resides. I have refused to issue him a passport
                        without intructions to that effect from the Department, to which the case is
                        now respectfully referred.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your No. 263, of the 24th ultimo, transmitting
                        the text of a recent ministerial circular touching the danger of consuming
                        raw pork as food, has been received.</p>
                    <p>I am disposed to regard this circular as evincing a willingness on the part
                        of the German authorities to consider the pork question in a practical way,
                        which cannot but promise good results.</p>
                    <p>There can be but little doubt of the fact, to which I called attention in my
                        letter to the President of February 28, transmitting the report of the pork
                        commission, that trichiniasis is distinctly traceable to the consumption of
                        the flesh of <hi rend="italic">freshly killed</hi> native hogs, and that the
                        virulence <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0297"/>of infection is observed
                        to diminish with the time elapsing between the killing of the animal and the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, and in reply to state that
                            no formal regulations have been adopted by the board of commissioners of
                            emigration in relation to the prevention of the landing of pauper
                            emigrants, the action of the board being governed by the provisions of
                            section 2 of the act of Congress to regulate immigration, of which a
                            copy is inclosed.</p>
                        <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0299"/>
                        <p>Where it is apparent, by reason of insanity or other permanent
                            disability, that an emigrant is unable to care for himself or herself,
                            such persons are detained on board the vessel and are prohibited from
                            landing. But in cases where, from attending circumstances, emigrants
                            arriving are thought likely to become a public charge, they are
                            transferred from the vessel to the landing depot and their cases are
                            investigated by the commissioners, each case being determined on its own
                            merits.</p>
                        <p>Where such emigrants have relatives or friends resident in this country,
                            they are promptly communicated with, and if they can show that they are
                            willing and able to provide for the emigrants, such are permitted to
                            depart. If the contrary, or that it appears, in the judgment of the
                            commissioners, that immigrants of this class are likely to become a
                            charge on the community, they are either returned to the vessel or
                            detained at the Emigrant Refuge until the sailing day of the vessel,
                            when they are placed on board by the officers of the Commission, and are
                            returned to the port from whence they came, at the expense of the
                            steamship company that brought them. The courts of this State have
                            recently decided that it is not necessary to make the examination of the
                            emigrants on board the vessel, and that it may be made at the emigrant
                            landing depot, the emigrants being considered still in the custody and
                            under the jurisdiction of the commissioners, and their right to prevent
                            such emigrants from landing, and to return them to the vessel, being

                            city of New York in the year 1877, my father returned to Germany in the
                            same year, leaving me in this country, when I was sixteen years old. As
                            my father neither would nor could take me with him back to Germany, I
                            was thrown on my own resources and was obliged to make my own living as
                            well as I could.</p>
                        <p>Now, when I have succeeded to make an honorable living, and at the same
                            time have become a citizen of this country before the court of common
                            pleas in the city of New York, the Government of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt
                            claims me for military duty, and threatens me with confiscating a little
                            inheritance which my mother left me in Rudolstadt, which, together with
                            my savings, would serve me to establish my own business in this
                            country.</p>
                        <p>This seems to me a manifest injustice, as I did not come to this country
                            on my own free will, being too young at that time to do so, and as I was
                            abandoned here as a minor to the protection of this country.</p>
                        <p>It is true that my father never became a citizen of the United States,
                            and that my mother, ignorant of the German laws, neglected to have my
                            name erased from the military register of Rudolstadt, so that I am not
                            protected by the Bancroft treaty; but it is nevertheless a moral
                            injustice to me, which I am sure your honor can right if you will kindly
                            submit my case to the German Government in Berlin.</p>

                            was a little over eleven years of age; that my mother died in the city

                            and that my father returned to Germany in the. same year, leaving me
                            behind in the city of New York, when I was a little over sixteen years
                            old; that I was thrown by this event on my own resources, and that I

                            this month, I send you inclosed a certified copy of my naturalization
                            certificate.</p>
                        <p>In regard to my inheritance, I am unable to tell you the amount, as it
                            consists in a <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0301"/>share of some
                            real estate which my mother owned at the time of her death in the city
                            of Königsee, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, Germany.</p>
                        <p>My father, Ferdinand Weniger, of said city, who is executor of my
                            mother’s will, informed me that the Amtsblatt of Königsee, which is the
                            official organ of the Government for the city of Königsee, called upon
                            me by a legal notice to appear for military duty, in default of which my
                            inheritance would be confiscated; that, furthermore, my father was
                            called upon by the sheriff of said city to produce my person before
                            court or to give information concerning my absence.</p>
                        <p>As for dates, I cannot give you any information. They seem to me
                            immaterial, as any only aim is that you may kindly cause the German
                            Government to erase my name from the military register, after which the
                            confiscation of my inheritance would be consequently void.</p>
                        <p>Should you, however, judge proper, I shall write to Königsee for official
                            documents concerning my case; but I fear the delay caused hereby would
                            perhaps complicate the matter, which is still simple.</p>

                            the several acts of the Congress of the United states of America for

                        <p>And the said applicant having produced to the said court such evidence,
                            having made such declaration and renunciation, and having taken such
                            oaths as are by the said acts required, thereupon it was ordered by the
                            court that the said applicant be admitted, and he was accordingly
                            admitted, to be a citizen of the United States of America.</p>

                        section 2172. I have recently been obliged to decide two such cases, and now
                        report them to the Department for its supervision.</p>

                                there does not appear; but he returned to his native land with his
                                family a few months later in the same year, and remained there, a
                                Saxon subject, until 1868. In that year the father returned to the
                                United States, where he became afterwards a naturalized citizen. The
                                son, Ludwig, on the contrary, <hi rend="italic">has never returned
                                    to the United States</hi>. Ludwig now requests a passport as an

                                and the father was naturalized at Yankton, Dak., in May, 1881, the

                                the age of nineteen years. The father and whole family returned to
                                the Crimea in 1883, leaving the United States in June of that year,
                                when the son was a little less than twenty-two years of age, bearing
                                a Department passport for all the family. The son declares his
                                intention of returning to the United States as a citizen thereof,
                                and was now on his way to America to obtain a passport as an

                        <p>The royal bezirks-court at Nuremberg, in its inclosed report of the 15th
                            of last month, together with its “judicial act” and four accompaniments,
                            recommends to the royal ministry of the interior to cause the expulsion
                            of the American citizen and Mormon missionary Johann Georg Hafen, of
                            Santa Clara (Utah, North America), from the Kingdom of Bavaria, under
                            article 50, subdivision 2, of the law of 16 April, 1868/23, Feb., 1872
                            concerning residence, marriage, and domicile, and furnishes the fullest
                            and most satisfactory grounds for its recommendation.</p>
                        <p>We take the liberty of also reporting in this connection that the Mormon
                            sect has already spread itself within the city limits and bezirks-court
                            domains of Fürth and Erlangen, in consequence of which we have caused
                            the district police authorities to proceed against this sect with
                            uniform action.</p>
                        <p>We further report that the foreman Anton Ilg, heretofore mentioned as the

                            own free will or otherwise is not known.</p>
                        <p>We have, as appears from the inclosed judicial document of the
                            bezirks-court, officially questioned Anton Ilg as to whether he still
                            insists on an answer to the request heretofore mentioned, made on
                            February 15–19, 1882, by him, in the name of his former associates in
                            faith, for permission to hold common indoor divine services in Bavaria;
                            he declared that for himself he withdrew that request.</p>

                        <p>With respect to the report of April 14 last made to the royal ministry of
                            state of the interior for church and school affairs, and transmitted by
                            them to the royal ministry of state of the interior for their
                            consideration, we express ourselves as follows:</p>
                        <p>Johann Georg Hafen, born in 1838, and of Santa Clara, Utah, North
                            America, made and, according to his own confession, makes it his
                            business to labor for the development and extension of the views held by
                            the Mormon sect. These views do not appear to harmonize with the
                            existing state and social order, wherefore the activity in promoting the
                            same of the said Hafen must, from consideration for the public welfare,
                            be opposed and made impossible.</p>
                        <p>He is therefore, in accordance with article 50, subdivision 2, of the law
                            of 16 April, 1868/23 Feb., 1872 concerning residence, marriage, and
                            domicile, expelled from the Kingdom of Bavaria.</p>
                        <p>The following is also decreed:</p>
                        <p>The inclosures of the first report herein named, as well as of the report
                            made under date of July 7 of last year to the royal state ministry of
                            the interior for church and school affairs, are to be herewith
                            returned.</p>
                        <p>It is remarked in this connection that the royal state ministry of the
                            interior for church and school matters does not propose to further
                            occupy itself with the consideration of a request made by Anton Ilg, in
                            the name of the “Community and Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day
                            Saints,” for recognition as a private church association, Ilg having,
                            under date of the 11th of March of last year, formally declared that he
                            withdrew this request. The request being subscribed by him alone, and no
                            documentary evidence of his authorization by individual members of the
                            community, therefore at present no formal representative of the request
                            is in existence.</p>

                        <p>The sect of the Mormons, of Salt Lake, in the North American Territory of
                            Utah, called “Church of Jesus Christ, the Latter Day Saints,” has
                            maintained for about a year past a so-called community in Munich and its
                            vicinity.</p>
                        <p>This community, according to the statistical report of the Swiss,
                            Italian, and German mission for the year 1883, in No. 3 of the Mormon
                            organ the Star, appearing at Berne, and according to a list submitted to
                            the elder of the community here, George Shambeck, painter’s assistant,
                            numbers thirty-four members, under the government of a community elder,
                            an elder, and two teachers.</p>
                        <p>This association is submitted to the South German conference, under
                            conference-president, Bishop Freidrich W. Schönfeld, and the two
                            traveling elders, William C. A. Smoot, jr., and James E. Jennings, while
                            this South German conference is under control of the Swiss, Italian, and
                            German mission, having its seat at Berne.</p>
                        <p>The said Bishop Schönfeld, according to a notice in 22 of the “Stern”
                            (Star) of November 15, 1883, has taken the place of the Mormon emissary
                            Johann Georg Hafen, of Santa Clara, Utah, expelled from Bavaria by
                            ministerial decree of July 11, 1883, No. 7743, under article 50,
                            subdivision 2, of the residence law of law of April 16, 1868/Feb. 23,
                            1872; cording to a publication on page 37 of No. 3 of the Star of
                            February 1 of last year, James E. Jennings and William C. A. Smoot jr.,
                            have been assigned to the said bishop as traveling elders.</p>
                        <p>James E. Jennings, born June 16, 1864, a student, and William C. A.
                            Smoot, jr., born March 8, 1853, are both from Salt Lake, Utah.</p>
                        <p>With the assumption of the leadership of the mission by Bishop Schönfeld
                            the Mormon community at Munich has received new life and received ten
                            new members. The before-mentioned traveling elders Smoot and Jennings
                            are at present engaged in a mission voyage in Bavaria; both, according
                            to a communication of the 30th instant from the bezirks-court at
                            Nuremberg, have lately spent several months at Nuremberg, but are now at
                            Munich. According to a notice of January 15 of last year in No. 2 of the
                            Mormon organ,’ the “Star,” it was the purpose of the said Jennings to
                            organize at Nuremberg a Sunday School for thirty Mormon children for
                            over eight years, the known age at which the acceptance of Mormonism is
                            permissible.</p>
                        <p>Jennings and Smoot now purpose, according to their own confession, to
                            promote the views of the Mormon sect in Munich also; that is to say, to
                            work for the further development and extension of the ends aimed at by
                            the Mormons, and for this object to even solicit public
                            subscription.</p>
                        <p>As appears from the notices often contained in the “Star,” the Mormon
                            agitation referred to also aims at winning emigrants to Utah, since,
                            according to the above-mentioned notices, numerous subjects of the
                            Empire and of Bavaria have, under the management and doubtless with the
                            pecuniary assistance of the Mormon emissaries, “emigrated to Salt Lake,
                            sailing for the purpose from non-German ports.</p>
                        <p>The archiepiscopal office of this city has already repeatedly called
                            attention to the serious nature of the extension of the Mormon sect
                            here.</p>
                        <p>Owing to the presence of the Mormon emissaries and to their agitation,
                            generally carried on very secretly, attempts will, it is supposed, be
                            made to win more proselytes, especially among school children, for their
                            sect.</p>
                        <p>The periodic return of the two officially appointed emissaries to Bavaria
                            is to be feared, and the continuance of their proselyte-making, in spite
                            of the surveillance established, and of the issue of the decree
                            prohibiting the holding by them of common religious exercises.</p>
                        <p>The endeavors of the Mormon sect not being compatible with the existing
                            state and social order, and the activity of the two before-named
                            emissaries in promoting the same appearing to be also objectionable in
                            view of the provisions of section 144 of the imperial penal code, I
                            consider that the removal of those persons is urgently demanded. I
                            permit myself to submit, in the highest quarter, the respectful motion
                            that William C. A. Smoot, jr., and James C. Jennings be expelled from
                            Bavarian territory, under article 50, subdivision 2 of the law of 16
                            April, 1868/23 Feb., 1872, concerning residence, marriage and domicile,
                            in the interests of the public welfare.</p>
                        <p>I transmit herewith the police protocol concerning the Mormon sect in
                            Munich, together with the several numbers of the “Star” for 1883 and
                            1884.</p>

                        <p>The undersigned, envoy, &amp;c., has been advised, through the American
                            consuls at Munich and Nuremberg, of certain proceedings taken by the
                            royal police boards of those cities, and the chief magistrate of the
                            latter city and by the royal Bavarian government of Mittelfranken and
                            the royal Bavarian state ministry of the interior for church and school
                            affairs for putting an end to the efforts made by certain Mormon
                            missionaries, called Hafen, Jennings, Smoot, and Lyman, to persuade men
                            and women in that province to emigrate to the region of Utah, in order
                            to join there the so-called Church of the Latter-Day Saints. The
                            doctrine of polygamy there inculcated and practiced is in direct
                            violation of the laws of the United States, and that unlawful system is
                            recruited chiefly by inducing foreigners to join them in their criminal
                            habits.</p>
                        <p>In view of this fact the undersigned is instructed to request the
                            mediation of his excellency Count Hatzfeldt, imperial secretary,

                            authorities named for their efforts to stop this unlawful and injurious
                            recruiting for purposes which violate alike the usages of Christian
                            civilization and the provisions of American law.</p>

                        received the immediate attention of this legation. Two of these cases are
                        complaints against expulsion from the Empire of American citizens.</p>

                                <p>After further correspondence, on April 21, 1883, the facts in
                                    detail were communicated to this legation, and on the same day
                                    the legation intervened at the foreign office, submitting the
                                    facts in the case, from which it appears that Winkelhausen had
                                    returned in January, 1882, on a visit to his native place, where
                                    he was arrested on <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0307"/>the
                                    19th of the following month, for alleged evasion of military
                                    duty, and not set at liberty until he had paid a tire of 150
                                    marks, which he paid under protest, and to avoid being
                                    imprisoned for the period of four weeks. This action by the
                                    authorities had been taken notwithstanding the fact that
                                    Winkelhausen’s certificate of naturalization had been deposited
                                    with the local police authorities. The foreign office was
                                    requested to cause an investigation to be made, and the amount
                                    of the fine to be returned if the essential facts of the case
                                    were found to be as stated.</p>

                                    the payment of the fine were inclosed with the note of
                                    intervention. On the 25th of April the foreign office
                                    acknowledged the receipt of this communication, and stated that
                                    an investigation had been ordered. On the 8th of May following,
                                    Winkelhausen informed the legation that he desired to have his
                                    certificate of naturalization back, as he must speedily return
                                    to the United States, and that he had empowered his brother, at
                                    Danzig, to receive his fine when it should be returned. On
                                    October 31 following, the foreign office informed the legation
                                    that the fine had been remitted and the return of the amount
                                    paid ordered. The foreign office at the same time returned
                                    Winkelhausen’s papers, which were on the same day sent to his
                                    brother, at Danzig, with notice of the decision.</p>

                                    that day the legation submitted to the foreign office his

                                    foreign office was requested to cause an investigation to be
                                    made and the fine to be remitted, the facts proving to be as
                                    stated. Broom was on the same day informed that the legation had

                                    that day informed the legation that his fine, together with the

                                    United States, before his return to his native place, probably
                                    contributed to the exceptionally long time consumed in the

                                    at the age of nineteen, in July, 1873, to the United States;

                                    on May 5, 1883, to make a brief visit to his relations,

                                    he delivered up his certificate of naturalization, under an
                                    assurance that it should soon be returned; that it was, however,
                                    still retained by the local authorities, although its return had
                                    been repeatedly requested. He had been informed that he must pay
                                    a fine of 150 marks, with 28 marks costs, for evasion of

                                <p>The legation expressed the hope that the foreign office would, if

                                    proceeding against Bendixen to be discontinued, and the fine and
                                    his certificate of naturalization to be returned, adding that it
                                    had not been able to verify his statement as to his
                                    naturalization, owing to the circumstances that his proof of the
                                    fact was in the hands of the local authorities. The legation
                                    informed Bendixen on the same day of its intervention on his
                                    behalf. A few days later the legation transmitted to the foreign
                                    office Bendixen’s certificate of naturalization, which had in
                                    the mean time been received from him, the authorities having
                                    given it him back.</p>

                                    Germany for the United States, which the legation gave him, and
                                    relating also to his wish to have his case speedily settled, the
                                    legation, on December 20 following, again called the attention
                                    of the foreign office to the same, notifying Bendixen on the
                                    same day that it had done so. This communication the foreign

                                    on the same day, as follows: He had returned to Berlin in May,
                                    1881, on a visit intended to last two months. While he was-in
                                    the United States, viz, on May 1, 1880, the land court at Berlin
                                    had entered a fine, including costs, of 160 marks, for evasion
                                    of military duty in Germany, with the alternative of one month’s
                                    imprisonment. He had now been served with the process of said
                                    court in execution of said judgment, and had been informed that

                                    although he had exhibited to the court his certificate of
                                    naturalization. The legation inclosed to the foreign office Mr.

                                <p>Brodersen returned to his native land on a visit in August, 1883,
                                    and on the 16th of November following was compelled by the local
                                    authorities to pay a fine amounting, with costs, to 207 marks
                                    and 20 pfennigs. Brodersen’s certificate of naturalization and
                                    the receipt for the payment of the fine were inclosed to the

                                <p>It appeared further that Brodersen had, upon his arrival at his

                                    in the hands of the foreign office, to facilitate his early

                                    him. On the 18th of July following the foreign office informed
                                    the legation that Brodersen’s fine had been remitted, with the
                                    costs, and returned his papers, which were transmitted to

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Among the many legal questions arising under
                        our naturalization laws ‘and treaty upon Which I am required to give
                        opinions at this legation there is one case that of Augustus Reichard, which
                        had previously been submitted to the Department of State. Its reply,(March
                        19, 1884), as he claimed, still left him in doubt touching his rights, and
                        now he appeals to this legation.</p>
                    <p>After an examination of the text of the German law of naturalization, I sent
                        him a reply as full and explicit as possible. I should be glad to know that
                        the opinion of his rights and liabilities, and those of his family, under
                        the treaty of 1868, as expressed in my reply to his letter, is concurred in
                        by the Department.</p>
                    <p>Copies of his letter and of my answer are herewith inclosed.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: As a citizen of the United States, I take
                            the liberty to transmit under cover a letter to the minister of foreign
                            affairs of the Kingdom of Prussia, Berlin, and respectfully to request
                            that the same be forwarded through your kind offices, as in this way
                            said communication will naturally receive a more attentive
                            consideration.</p>
                        <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0311"/>
                        <p>The object of my addressing the Prussian ministry is to ascertain whether
                            the authorities here might possibly look upon my prolonged stay in
                            Germany, on account of ill health, as being in conflict with the
                            Bancroft treaty of 22d February, 1868, so far as my claims to the
                            preservation of my prerogatives as an American citizen are concerned. In
                            said letter I state that I was born in 1820, in the then Kingdom of
                            Hanover, now a Prussian province; that I fulfilled my military
                            obligations in 1840, emigrated to New Orleans in 1844, made my
                            declaration to become an American citizen on 21th January, 1850, and
                            received the certificate of my American citizenship on 4th November,
                            1853, which certificate is now in my possession. I further state that in
                            1881 my health became so deplorable that my physicians declared that the
                            only means of saving my life were a radical change of climate, free from
                            the excessive heat of American summers, and a prolonged, use of the
                            mineral waters of Germany. Consequently I settled here in Dresden in the
                            summer of 1881; returned to New Orleans last winter for six months,
                            partly to attend to my business there, partly to ascertain whether my
                            somewhat improved health would withstand the climate. This, as soon as
                            the heat recommenced, was by no means the case, and my physicians
                            declared most emphatically that I must stay away fox several years more.
                            In obtaining my new passport at Washington my attention for the first
                            time was called to the details of the Bancroft treaty, by our Louisiana
                            Senators, Hon. B. F. Jonas and General Randall be Gibson, who advised me
                            to be very careful not to omit anything which might be necessary to
                            avoid being mixed up with the stipulations of Article IV of said treaty,
                            Under these circumstances I thought it advisable to address the Hon.
                            Frederick T. Frelinghuysen and to request to be enlightened on, the
                            following three points, viz: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>On my return to Germany I intend to place on record, with the
                                    United States legation at Berlin my, declaration that although
                                    the state of my health may necessitate a stay in Germany for
                                    more than two years, it is my intention to preserve for myself
                                    and children all the prerogatives of citizens of the United
                                    States, to which country I shall return as soon as circumstances
                                    may permit. Will such proceedings prevent the German,
                                    authorities from calling in question nay rights as a citizen of
                                    the United States, and those of my children?</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>Suppose the above declaration should not have the desired,
                                    effect as far as I am personally concerned, could this possibly
                                    affect the status of my children (now all minors) as citizens of
                                    the United States, where they were all born, the father being a
                                    naturalized citizen, the mother a native American; in other
                                    words, would the altered state of citizenship of the father
                                    forcibly bring about a change of citizenship of his minor
                                    children and his native American wife?</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>If none of the above joints could be decided in a positive
                                    manner, would my return to this country (United States) every
                                    two years, for a limited period, remove all doubts and his
                                    difficulties.?</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In reply I received a letter from the Hon. Frederick T. Frelinghuysen
                            dated 19th March, 1884, which I beg to inclose for perusal; it leaves my
                            position still clouded with doubt. Perhaps the honorable Secretary of
                            State might have been more positive in his reply if I had stated to him,
                            the positive fact that, with the exception of my villa here, which I
                            bought at a very low price from a returning American, my whole fortune
                            is in vested in real estate in Louisiana, which I intend to retain
                            intact, and that, besides, I still own my dwelling-house in New Orleans,
                            with the intention of reoccupying it with my family on our return, I
                            really believe no stronger proof could be given of any intention to
                            return to the United States, and as a matter of course to retain my
                            American citizenship of nearly one-third of a century’s standing.</p>
                        <p>On my return here I had several conversations on the subject with the
                            United States consul and vice-consul, who are both of the opinion that
                            inasmuch as I had fulfilled my military obligation before emigrating,
                            having been for more than thirty-one years an American citizen, my wife
                            and children being native Americans, and, moreover, my means being all
                            invested in the United, States, from where alone I draw all my income,
                            the Bancroft treaty could find no application to my particular case; and
                            they further state that they know of many similar cases where the
                            individuals have never been troubled by the authorities here. They are
                            decidedly of the opinion that all that is necessary would be to have
                            every two years my passport renewed at the United States legation in
                            Berlin, and they think that perhaps, in order to observe even the very,
                            wording of Article IV of the Bancroft treaty., it might be well every
                            two year to spend a certain time abroad.</p>
                        <p>This may probably be your opinion likewise, and you may perhaps consider
                            my steps to ascertain the opinion of the Prussian ministry of foreign
                            affairs as altogether unnecessary; yet I thought it might serve to
                            remove all possibility of future difficulties with the authorities here,
                            as also in such cases to avoid a necessitated intervention of the United
                            States legation in the future. I should feel under great obligations if,
                            at a convenient time, you Would kindly do me the favor of transmitting
                            to me the views you entertain respecting my particular case, and</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your letter of the 10th instant is
                            received. With it you inclose a communication addressed to the German
                            ministry for foreign affairs, and request that the same he transmitted
                            to its destination by this legation, in order, as you state, that it may
                            receive more attentive consideration. In the communication to this
                            legation, as well as in that to the German ministry, you present facts
                            relating to your compliance before emigration with the obligation of
                            military service in your native country, your acquisition of citizenship
                            in the United States, and your places of residence since, and conclude
                            by soliciting both from this legation and the German ministry
                            expressions of their views upon your case.</p>
                        <p>The essential facts stated appear to be the following: You were born in
                            Germany in 1820; emigrated in 1844, at the age of twenty-four years, to
                            the United States, where you were naturalized January 21, 1850, as shown
                            by a certificate of naturalization now in your possession; that in the
                            summer of 1881 you returned to Germany in pursuit of health, and settled
                            at Dresden; that, after a residence in Germany of more than two years,
                            you returned last winter for business and other purposes to the United
                            States, where you spent six months; that, finding the American climate
                            still injurious to your health, and being advised by your physicians to
                            absent yourself for several years more, you returned to Germany, after
                            obtaining a new passport from the Department of State, and after making
                            yourself acquainted with the details of the Bancroft treaty, with the
                            special view of guarding yourself against the stipulation of Article IV
                            of said treaty. You also state that you addressed a communication to the
                            honorable Secretary of State on the subject of your case, and received,
                            under date of March 19, 1884, a reply thereto which left your position
                            still clouded with doubt.</p>
                        <p>You quote the three questions submitted in your communication to the
                            Department of State, and request this legation to answer them,
                            substantially repeating the same inquiries in your inclosure addressed
                            to the German Government.</p>
                        <p>Briefly stated, you wish to know (1) whether, in view of the state of
                            your health, you may again stay in Germany for more than two years
                            without forfeiting for yourself or children, now all minors and born in
                            the United States, the rights of American citizenship; (2) whether a
                            possible forcible alteration of your citizenship would bring about a
                            change in the citizenship of your minor children and your native
                            American wife; (3) would your return to the United States every two
                            years for a limited period remove all doubts and difficulties?</p>
                        <p>Replying to your first inquiry, you are informed that Atrticle IV of the
                            treaty referred to leaves it optional with the German authorities to
                            hold that the renunciation of American citizenship exists, as to these
                            authorities, after your residence in Germany shall have been prolonged
                            beyond the period of two years. This legation cannot anticipate the
                            action thereon of the German Government. But if they should so hold,
                            that would not make you a German subject without voluntary proceedings
                            taken by yourself therefor. As we read the German naturalization law,
                            after being once a citizen of another country you can again become a
                            German subject only by applying for naturalization under their forms of
                            law. They might expel you from Germany, but cannot make you a subject
                            against your will.</p>
                        <p>In reply to your second inquiry, your children were all born in
                            America—we so understand it—after you became a citizen. They are,
                            therefore, native-born American citizens, and can become liable as
                            German subjects in only one of two ways—(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) by
                            their father becoming a German subject during their minority and while
                            they remain under paternal control, or (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) by
                            they themselves voluntarily becoming naturalized under German laws. We
                            know of no case of an American-born citizen being put into the army as a
                            German subject, without the father’s consent, either by naturalization
                            or expressly. Your own naturalization as a German subject would abandon
                            for your wife and for your minor children, at least till they attain
                            their majority, their rights as American citizens, as their condition
                            always follows yours.</p>
                        <p>In reply to your third inquiry, the legation is of opinion that recurring
                            visits to Germany, not prolonged beyond two years, are permissible under
                            the treaty, <hi rend="italic">if preceded by bona fide resumptions of
                                residence in the United States</hi>, and that the residence of six
                            months which preceded your recent return to Germany should be regarded
                            as such a residence.</p>
                        <p>In the opinion of this legation, the German Government reserved the right
                            in question in order to act or decline to act upon each case as it
                            should be presented at the time for action, without interference by the
                            United States. We do not, therefore, believe that you would now obtain
                            from them a satisfactory reply, and do not think it <pb n="213"
                                xml:id="pg_213" facs="0313"/>advisable to transmit your application
                            to them, thus calling special attention to your case and that of your
                            children. The only effect, in our view of the case, of your overstaying
                            two years would, be to give the German authorities the right to say
                            (without our interference) that you or your children, or both, must
                            become naturalized or leave the country. As long as you hold to the <hi
                                rend="italic">bona fide</hi> intention to return to the United
                            States to reside there as a citizen, <hi rend="italic">we</hi> hold you
                            and your minor children to be still American citizens.</p>
                        <p>Your inclosures are herewith returned.</p>

                            States to be that the provisions of article 32 of the treaty of
                            Washington, which relate to Newfoundland, shall cease to be in force and

                        <p>Mr. Frelinghuysen states that your lordships inquiry does not appear to
                            invite any discussion of the points involved, or to ask anything more
                            than a simple declaration of the intention of the United States
                            Government as to the scope of the notice of the termination so given. He
                            states, however, for my information, the reasons why the thirty-second
                            article must be considered as in force so long as the other articles
                            which are specifically terminable are in force. As his views on this

                            mentioned, in conversation with Sir Cooper Key, that Her Majesty’s ship
                            Alert might be of use to the United States Government in an expedition
                            to be dispatched in search of the expedition which is missing in the
                            Arctic regions.</p>
                        <p>I write a line to say that we have not forgotten the very considerate
                            conduct of the Government of the United States on the occasion of the

                            any suggestions, through the usual official Channel, that the Alert
                            would be of any use to the United States Government, we shall be happy

                            for which the diplomatic phrase “peculiar satisfaction” is altogether
                            too colorless that I hasten to acknowledge the reception of your private

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your dispatch No. 350, of the 4th
                        of May, 1882, in relation to the case of John E. McCormack, who was at that
                        time a prisoner in the jail of Clonmel, county Tipperary, Ireland, I now
                        transmit <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0317"/>to you a copy of a letter
                        of 28th of November last, addressed by Mr. McCormack to the President, in
                        which he invokes the action of this Government to secure for him from that
                        of Great Britain $50,000, as indemnity for five months’ imprisonment in the
                        jails of Clonmel and Naas. You have in the records of your legation a
                        certificate of the naturalization of John McCormack in the justices’ court
                        of Troy, Rensselaer County, New York, on the 25th of October, 1867. His
                        explanation of the apparent discrepancy in the name under which he goes and
                        under which he was arrested, namely, that he adopted the middle initial R,
                        as representing the name of his mother, whose maiden name was Ryan, in order
                        to distinguish himself from several other John McCormack’s residing in the
                        county Tipperary, three of whom were first cousins of his own, appears to be
                        reasonable, and, assuming that it was at the time satisfactory to you, I
                        proceed upon the hypothesis that the John McCormack naturalized in Troy in
                        1867 and the present claimant are identical.</p>
                    <p>From the statements made to you by Mrs. McCormack, the wife of the claimant,
                        it appears that her husband returned to Ireland in 1869, and that, with the
                        exception of a brief visit to the United States in 1873, he had resided
                        there from that time (1869) up to the time of his arrest, in the latter part
                        of 1881 or the beginning of 1882. He still resides there, as his letter to
                        the President is dated from the “People Office,” a local newspaper in
                        Tipperary of which he is and for many years has been the publisher and
                        proprietor and presumably the editor, although that fact is not stated. He
                        has thus been for a period of over fourteen years absent from his adopted
                        country\, and, moreover, a voluntary resident of the country of his birth,
                        and within the jurisdiction, territorial, political, and judicial, of the
                        Government of his original allegiance, under whose flag he was born and grew
                        to manhood. He has during all this period been relieved from his proper
                        share of the duties and obligations that attach to and may be imposed on a
                        citizen of the United States. He pays no taxes, either State or Federal, in
                        this country, and does not allege that he has one dollar’s worth of
                        property, real or personal, within the territorial jurisdiction of the
                        United States; he is not within the call or control of this Government if he
                        were needed for its defense-, still further, he has not only failed during
                        all these years to express any intention of ever returning to the United
                        States, but he has also failed, in his acts, his general conduct, and his
                        pursuits, to give any sign or manifestation of such intention to return to
                        the country which he claims as that of his adoption. He writes and talks as
                        a man who considers himself domiciled for life in the country of his birth
                        and original allegiance. These facts form very strong evidence of voluntary
                        expatriation.</p>
                    <p>The Congress of the United States has clearly recognized, in its declaratory
                        act of the 27th of July, 1868 (Revised Statutes, section 1999), the right of
                        voluntary expatriation as an inherent right of every American citizen. He
                        may denationalize himself at any time he sees fit, and the same law
                        expressly forbids any executive or ministerial officer of this Government
                        from questioning the right.</p>
                    <p>It is true, as you state in your No. 350, of the 4th of May, 1882, that with
                        some continental powers the United States have concluded conventions on the
                        subject of citizenship and naturalization by the terms of which two years’
                        voluntary residence of a naturalized citizen of the United States in the
                        country of his origin is to be taken as presumptive evidence of his
                        renunciation of United States allegiance and citizenship. We have, however,
                        no treaty on the subject with Great Britain. The supplemental convention of
                        February, 1871, which provided a <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0318"
                        />mode and farm for renunciation of citizenship for the citizens and
                        subjects of either country naturalized in the other, expired by limitation
                        in August, 1872. Therefore, the case of British subjects naturalized in the
                        United States, who return to and voluntarily resume a permanent residence
                        within the territorial jurisdiction and dominions of Her Britannic Majesty,
                        must rest for settlement and determination upon the facts and upon general
                        but well understood and settled principles. Thus, an American citizen may
                        travel or reside in a foreign country indefinitely for the purposes of
                        education, health, business, or of pleasure, and continued absence from the
                        United States, not accompanied by any act inconsistent with his allegiance
                        to his country, will not cause a forfeiture of citizenship; If, however,
                        such citizen removes his family and property from the United States, enters
                        into business and settles permanently in a foreign country, neither
                        expressing nor manifesting by his acts any intention of returning
                        permanently to the United States, and if under the latter circumstances he
                        wishes the protection of this Government against the Government or laws of
                        the Country in which he has residence, it becomes a proper subject of
                        inquiry whether he has not voluntarily abandoned his right to such
                        protection. The active exertion of the Government in the protection of a
                        citizen may also be influenced by the acts of the individual; even if he has
                        not technically forfeited his citizenship.</p>
                    <p>This Government recognizes neither by its laws nor its practice any
                        distinction between a native and a naturalized citizen. Both are alike
                        entitled to the protection of the Government, abroad as well as at home, and
                        each has such protection extended to him in the Same measure under proper
                        conditions. Each ease must of course rest on its own facts and
                        circumstances, but we are not without at least analogous executive
                        precedents bearing with more or less pertinency upon the case of Mr.
                        McCormack.</p>
                    <p>In 1866 Mr. Seward, then Secretary of State, received an application for
                        passports from five brothers residing in Curçao, who were born in that
                        island; of parents citizens of the United States. The young men had always
                        resided in Curaçao, had all their property there, and had never been in the
                        United States. The passports were refused, on the ground that they were not
                        entitled to the protection of this Government.</p>
                    <p>In 1873 the son of John Peppin, a Frenchman by birth, invoked the protection
                        of this Government against the operation of French military law. The
                        circumstances of his case were these: Peppin when a young man emigrated to
                        the United States, was educated in Kentucky, became a citizen of the United
                        States, resided in Kew Orleans several years, returned to France, married a
                        French woman, and remained in France until his death. Some eight years after
                        his return to France two children were born to him, one of them the son in
                        question, who at the time of his application was eighteen years old.
                        Protection in this ease was refused by my predecessor, Mr. Fish.</p>
                    <p>In 1856 Mr. Gushing, then Attorney-General of the United States, in a learned
                        opinion, maintains the right Of expatriation, and places the evidence in
                        support thereof on a hypothetical basis, and in all respects similar to the
                        facts in Mr. McCormack’s case; that is, that when the individual removed
                        himself, his family, and his property from the country, and takes up his
                        residence in a foreign country, manifesting no intention to return to the
                        United Stated, he is to be considered as having renounced his allegiance to
                        this Government (8 Opinions, page 130). And Mr. Black, the successor of Mr.
                        Gushing, in 1857, holds the same doctrine (9 Opinions, page 63).</p>
                    <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0319"/>
                    <p>It would be superfluous to multiply these precedents. The action of the
                        executive branch of the Government has been uniform on the subject. When a
                        citizen of the United States voluntarily places himself within the
                        jurisdiction of a foreign Government, and subjects himself and his property
                        to its laws, and when such citizen afterwards seeks the interference of the
                        United States to redress some wrong which he may have suffered at the hands
                        of such foreign Government, this Government reserves, to itself the right of
                        determining not only on the merits of the particular claim, but also on the
                        claimant’s right to its protection. It is for this Government to say whether
                        the claim shall be presented or not to the foreign Government.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Mr. McCormack, however, it is not necessary to decide whether
                        he has technically lost his adopted citizenship. He is at liberty, and
                        peacefully following his occupation in the country of which he complains,
                        and to which he returned two years after his naturalization in the United
                        States. He asks a money indemnity for imprisonment suffered under the laws
                        of the country where he lives, and asks the United States to procure it for
                        him. To the United States, for over fourteen years, he has rendered no
                        service, he has paid no taxes, has not been available for the defense of his
                        adopted country in case of possible war; neither has he been accessible for
                        jury duty, and he has no personal or material interests here.</p>
                    <p>After a careful consideration of the facts and, circumstances of the case, it
                        is not conceived that the claim is one which can with propriety be presented
                        by this Government to that of Great Britain. No suggestion of this
                        instruction, however, is to be taken as expressing an opinion as to what Mr.
                        McCormack’s political status would be should he return permanently to the
                        United States, nor as to the action of this Government were he suffering
                        present unjust personal treatment.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Adverting to the subject-matter of my
                            dispatch No. 130, of May 11, 1881, I inclose herewith two printed copies
                            of the speech of his excellency the governor at the opening of council
                            last Friday, and would draw attention to the marked paragraph intimating
                            an intention of levying a duty on kerosene oil, hitherto imported
                            free.</p>
                        <p>I think that such a measure is to be deprecated, even from local
                            considerations, for the product is a great boon to the natives, being by
                            far the best and cheapest illuminator they can get, and an impost
                            increasing its present cost will, I fear, militate against its enlarged
                            introduction. The act would also be very unreciprocal towards the United
                            States, for kerosene is the only American commodity comprised in the
                            300,000 rupees’ worth of our goods possibly consumed here yearly that is
                            free of duty, whereas the Ceylon exports to the United States, amounting
                            to over 2,000,000 rupees in value yearly, are all in out <hi
                                rend="italic">free list.</hi></p>
                        <p>The value of the kerosene oil imported here last year was under 119,000
                            rupees, the duty upon which at 5 per cent, ad valorem, a rate analogous
                            to that ordinarily levied here upon most goods, would therefore produce
                            the small sum of 5,950 rupees, an amount, it strikes me, so
                            insignificant as not to be worth the risk of interfering in such a
                            direction with the trade, and out of all comparison with what the colony
                            would lose were our Government to put a duty upon the 560,000 rupees’
                            worth of cocoanut oil alone we now take annually from Ceylon; and yet,
                            to my knowledge, the traffic in that article at home yields so
                            inconsiderable a profit that the imposition of any duty upon it at all
                            in America would effectually put a stop to the trade, and thus this
                            island would be deprived of about its best customer for so much at least
                            as we now take of the article, a deprivation, in fact, which in these
                            hard times would be severely felt here.</p>
                        <p>Immediately upon learning the intention of the local government to put on
                            this duty, I wrote soliciting an interview with his excellency the
                            governor with a view to represent these facts to him, and am assured in
                            a letter of yesterday’s date that he will appoint a time to meet me
                            after his levee on the 13th instant. I hope then to be able to place the
                            matter before him in such a light as will induce a reconsideration, of
                            the subject, and possibly an abstention from the measure, which I
                            suppose would not have been thought of now were it not that the colony
                            is suffering from a diminished revenue.</p>

                            last, I have to report that the promised interview with the governor
                            therein alluded to occurred on the 22d idem.</p>

                            wrote to the colonial secretary on that day, and inclosed herewith is a
                            copy of my letter; in reply to which I was informed, under date 5th
                            January, 1884, that “my fetter would be submitted to the executive and
                            legislative councils by the governor.”</p>
                        <p>It now appears, however, that an act levying a duty of 5 per cent. ad

                            and become a law, without the last-named body being aware that I had

                            present for the consideration of the government the following
                            propositions which I conceive may have an important bearing upon the
                            subject, viz: The measure would certainly be unreciprocal towards the
                            United States, inasmuch as that country admits free of duty every
                            considerable Ceylon product, to the value of over 2,000,000 rupees per
                            annum; whereas of the perhaps 300,000 rupees’ worth of American products
                            introduced here indirectly annually, only kerosene, valued at 119,000
                            rupees is admitted duty free; and kerosene as a commodity, instead of
                            competing with any local products, is a valuable auxiliary to other
                            oils, and a positive boon to the inhabitants, especially the poorer
                            classes, as it enables them to light their dwellings in a cheap,
                            effective, cleanly, and otherwise commendable manner, in striking
                            contrast to the inferior and slovenly results and modes connected with
                            the use of native oils; and its use as a substitute for cocoanut oil
                            sets free an equal quantity at least of the latter article for export,
                            which, realizing more than double the cost of kerosene, leaves the
                            colony a handsome profit from the transaction, in addition to the
                            benefit derived from the American product being a more perfect
                            illuminator.</p>
                        <p>It is more than probable that a duty on kerosene would militate against
                            its importation, for, as a matter of fact, I believe the only direct
                            shipment from America here, though admitted free, failed to yield a
                            profit. It was expected, however, that the transaction would open the
                            way to future dealings, and it appears that another small shipment is
                            now <hi rend="italic">en route</hi> from New York, which probably would
                            not have been sent had the shippers anticipated its being subjected to
                            an import duty.</p>
                        <p>In marked contrast to the relative position of kerosene to local products
                            here are the circumstances governing the produce of this island in the
                            United States, for the principal articles of it consumed there, viz,
                            plumbago, coir, and cocoanut oil, compete with and lower the value of
                            American products, without yielding superior results. It is true the use
                            of cocoanut oil as a substitute for tallow sets free an equal amount of
                            the latter article for exportation, which in principle is analogous with
                            kerosene here, but different in degree, since in the latter case the
                            imported article is superior to the native product for the uses it is
                            put to, and so much cheaper that a large profit is gained by the
                            exchange, whereas the difference between the value of cocoanut oil and
                            tallow in America is so small that very little is gained by substituting
                            one for the other.</p>
                        <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0322"/>
                        <p>I need not, I am aware, point out the trifling amount that a duty upon
                            kerosene would yield, for the Government would have noted its
                            insignificance, and if, as I have the highest authority for concluding,
                            the object of levying a duty is to bring the article more completely
                            under Government surveillance, I do most respectfully ask and earnestly
                            hope that some less onerous mode of accomplishing that purpose may be
                            adopted than so unreciprocal a measure as the levying of a duty upon the
                            only free product of a country which buys so largely from Ceylon and
                            admits the latter country products free.</p>

                        <p>The executive council is not prepared to grant the relief advocated by
                            the United States minister in England, for the following reasons:</p>
                        <p>In accordance with customs laws, no cognizance can be taken of floating
                            cargoes whenever it is found necessary to impose duties which may affect
                            such cargoes, and the local ordinance, No. 17 of 1869 is very distinct
                            upon this point, inasmuch as it declares that, in respect of an
                            importation, the time for the first levying of duty shall be deemed to
                            be the time at which the ship has actually come within the limits of the
                            port where the goods are to be discharged. It should also be borne in
                            mind that until the 31st March, 1878, there was an ad valorem duty of 5
                            per cent, levied upon kerosene oil, and that its reimposition became
                            necessary from a falling off of the revenue. It was publicly known that
                            this measure was recommended to the Government by the retrenchment
                            committee in the early part of 1883, and an objection to the duty by the
                            United States consul in Colombo was considered in executive council and
                            subsequently in the legislative council, but the sense of both councils
                            was against granting the concession applied for or deferring the
                            operation of the law by which the duty has been reimposed.</p>

                        obliged to avail itself of the good offices of the authorities of foreign
                        countries to oppose and suppress, so far as practicable, the missions of the
                        Mormons.</p>
                    <p>I will therefore thank you to bring the matter to the attention of Her
                        Britannic Majesty’s Government, with the request that appropriate
                        instructions may be issued to the proper authorities, with a view to
                        checking the proposed shipment of Mormon recruits to this country from
                        India.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that three
                            Mormon missionaries, Messrs. Willis, McCann, and Pratt, have recently
                            arrived and are now in Calcutta.</p>
                        <p>Their object is to make converts, and it is to be expected that they will
                            take them to Utah.</p>
                        <p>It is likely to be several weeks, and may be months, before these
                            missionaries will have enough converts to make a shipment from this
                            port. I expect to keep advised as to their movements, but from the
                            length of time necessarily required to communicate between this country
                            and England, it is very doubtful whether a report sent from here to the
                            minister at London, after the facts shall have been ascertained,
                            pursuant to section 381 of the Consular Regulations, would reach there
                            and could be acted upon before the missionaries and their converts will
                            have left for the United States.</p>
                        <p>I would respectfully ask whether any means of prevention exist or whether
                            any action on my part to prevent the sailing of such converts is called
                            for.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your instruction No. 974, of the
                        8th September last, I have now the honor to inclose a report, drawn up,
                        under my supervision, by Mr. Henry White, one of the secretaries of this
                        legation, on the subject of unclaimed estates in England, which, I believe,
                        covers the whole field of inquiry.</p>
                    <p>I hope it may be of some use in saving the money of those foolish dupes in
                        the United States who have not already thrown it away in the worse than
                        useless pursuit of imaginary fortunes in Great Britain. They might as well
                        seek to recover possession of a castle in Spain through the intervention of
                        our minister to that country,</p>
                    <p>I may as well mention that in a letter received within a few days with
                        relation to a non-existent estate here there was inclosed a lithographed
                        circular in the name of an equally non-existent firm of solicitors. I have
                        already communicated with the police in respect of these swindlers, <pb

                        able to break up one, at least, of these dens of thieves.</p>
                    <p>I cannot close this dispatch without commending the industry and intelligence
                        shown by Mr. White in performing the task assigned to him, and the highly
                        satisfactory manner in which he has acquitted himself.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor, in accordance with your
                            instructions, to submit to you the following report in reference to
                            unclaimed estates and property in this country, and to the claims
                            thereunto which are continually addressed by our fellow-citizens to this
                            legation, together with a few details tending to show the utter
                            hopelessness of most of these claims, and the means necessary to
                            establish such as have any validity, instances of which are, however,
                            extremely rare.</p>
                        <p>The archives of the legation show that a considerable proportion of our
                            miscellaneous correspondence is composed of letters upon this subject.
                            The writers in some instances furnish a few details as to the nature and
                            locality of the property to which they imagine themselves to be
                            entitled; more frequently they merely state that, according to an
                            advertisement in some local newspaper, a very large sum of money or
                            landed estate was left, at a period more or less remote, either to a
                            person of the same name as their own, or to one of different name from
                            whom they believe themselves to be descended; and, with very few
                            exceptions, they ask the legation to make immediate inquiries in the
                            matter, frequently even to bring the case before Parliament.</p>
                        <p>It is evident that most of these correspondents imagine that the
                            prosecution of their claims must be comparatively easy, and that they
                            are lamentably ignorant not only of the great difficulty in finding out
                            the whereabouts of the estate referred to, but also of the absolute
                            necessity that not one link should be missing in the chain of evidence
                            as to their descent, identity, and right to the property claimed;
                            otherwise its recovery is impossible. It never appears to enter the
                            minds of those who write to us in reference to estates that their claim,
                            however good originally, may be rendered valueless by a statute of
                            limitations; neither are they apparently aware that they should not
                            apply for information or assistance to diplomatic or consular officers
                            of the United States, who have no facilities, even had they the time,
                            for making the minute investigations requisite, but to a lawyer, whose
                            particular business it is to attend to such matters, which require
                            special training and long experience.</p>
                        <p>It is the invariable rule of the legation to acknowledge promptly the
                            reception of all these communications, to acquaint those who furnish any
                            details whereby the property claimed may be traced that our staff is
                            totally inadequate to undertake such laborious researches as the
                            prosecution of their claim would involve, and to refer them to reputable
                            solicitors who make a special study of business of that kind. To
                            correspondents who furnish very meager details, or none at all, an
                            answer is sent to the effect that the data furnished are totally
                            insufficient to enable the legation to be of any use to them.</p>
                        <p>There seems to be no doubt that many are led to believe themselves heirs
                            to vast estates in Great Britain by designing persons on both sides of
                            the ocean, who, with a view to personal gain, insert notices in local
                            newspapers in the United States to the effect that a large property left
                            by a person of the same name with that of some well-known family of the
                            district, or of some exceedingly common name likely to occur anywhere,
                            such as Smith or Jones, or who distribute far and wide lists of
                            unclaimed estates which do not exist. Large sums of money are annually
                            thrown away by the dupes of these advertisements and fictitious lists,
                            and a handsome revenue is made by the agents, as they call themselves,
                            for the discovery of lost heirs and the recovery of unclaimed estates.
                            The <hi rend="italic">modus operandi</hi> usually adopted by these
                            agents is to ask first for a remittance of £2 or £3, to cover the cost
                            of copying the will upon which the claim purports to be based; then a
                            larger sum for the expenses of instituting inquiries; and at each
                            successive stage more blackmail is levied, the correspondence being so
                            cleverly conducted that several years frequently elapse before the fraud
                            is discovered. None should contribute a dollar to unknown agents,
                            especially towards any expenses <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0326"
                            />connected with establishing claims to estates in this country, until
                            inquiry has been made of counsel here, first, as to the <hi
                                rend="italic">existence</hi> of the estate, and then as to the
                            chances of its recovery. I am told by reputable solicitors that not one
                            claim in a thousand of all those referred to them by the legation has
                            had any validity whatever, and very few, during their long experience of
                            claims from America, have been successful.</p>
                        <p>Unclaimed estates may be divided into several classes, but the claims
                            which the legation is requested to investigate consist (1) of estates
                            reverting to the Grown through the owners thereof dying intestate,
                            without known heirs or next of kin, and of estates of which possession
                            has been taken by some person not the rightful heir, because such heir
                            was unknown; (2) of unclaimed deposits and dividends on Government
                            stocks in the Bank of England; and (3) of unclaimed funds in
                            chancery.</p>
                        <p>(1) Until recently there was no limit to the time during which
                                    estates which had reverted to the Crown through the death of the
                                    owners intestate, without known heirs, might be recovered.
                                    Towards the end of the last session of Parliament, however, the
                                    “intestate estate” acts (47 and 48 Vict., chapter 71) was
                                    passed, by which the statute of limitations is applied to this
                                    class of unclaimed property, whether real or personal, and the
                                    presentation of petitions of right with reference thereto
                                    prohibited, “except within the same time and subject to the same
                                    rules of law and equity in and subject to which an action for
                                    the like purpose might be brought by or against a subject.” In
                                    short, estates such as the foregoing are now subject to the same
                                    law with those in the possession of individuals not originally
                                    the rightful owners, but whose ownership becomes absolute after
                                    the lapse of a certain period during, which no claimant
                                    appears.</p>
                                <p>This period is fixed for real estate by the “real property
                                    limitation act of 1874” (37 and 38 Vict., chapter 57), which
                                    provides that no land shall be recoverable but within the next
                                    twelve years after the time at which the right to bring an
                                    action or suit for the recovery thereof shall have first accrued
                                    to the person making or bringing the same. Should such persons
                                    be under any of the following disabilities: Infancy, coverture,
                                    idiocy, or unsoundness of mind, at the time when the right to
                                    bring an action for the recovery of such land first accrued,
                                    this act provided that they shall have the same rights in the
                                    premises as though the twelve years had not yet expired, during
                                    the six years next after the time at which they shall cease to
                                    be under such disabilities up to a limit of thirty years, after
                                    which no action can be brought for the recovery of land, even
                                    though the person having the right to bring the same may have
                                    been laboring under the disabilities mentioned during the whole
                                    period.</p>
                                <p>No action maybe brought for the recovery of personal property
                                    after a lapse of twenty years (23 and 24 Vict., chapter 38).</p>
                                <p>Any attempt, therefore, to recover real estate from the Crown or
                                    individuals after a lapse of twelve years (which may be extended
                                    to thirty under certain circumstances), and personal property
                                    after a lapse of twenty years, however valid the claim of the
                                    person making the attempts may have been originally, is certain
                                    to end in failure.</p>
                                <p>All members, consequently, of the “Jennens Association of the
                                    United States of America” may rest assured that their
                                    subscriptions are simply money thrown away, if their object be
                                    the recovery of the Jennens estate. Recently a letter was
                                    received here from a member of the aforesaid “Jennens
                                    Association,” who had just been notified that a general
                                    assessment of $5 had been levied for the year ending June 30,
                                    1884, and who, before paying the same, inquired whether the
                                    legation could furnish any information regarding the Jennens
                                    estate, “said to be pending before the court of chancery in
                                    England.”</p>
                                <p>The letter inclosed sundry interesting documents emanating from
                                    the “association,” in one of which it is stated that “the
                                    finance committee are fully satisfied with our agent’s progress
                                    in the case,” and, further on, that “it becomes necessary for
                                    each and every member of this association to respond with cash
                                    as liberally as their means will afford, to carry our case to a
                                    final issue, which we have every reason to believe will be
                                    successful provided the funds be furnished.” I can only say that
                                    the finance committee of the “Jennens Association” must be
                                    easily satisfied, as an official of the court of chancery
                                    recently informed me that, to the best of his belief, there is
                                    not a sixpence in chancery belonging to the “Jennens estate.” So
                                    many letters of inquiry have been addressed to the legation
                                    during the past forty years (possibly longer) respecting this
                                    estate, that I venture to give a few particulars on the
                                    subject.</p>
                                <p>William Jennens, a bachelor of Acton, Suffolk, and Grosvenor
                                    Square, London, died in 1798, possessed of about two millions
                                    sterling. He left a will, which unfortunately he had forgotten
                                    to sign. Consequently his landed estates passed, contrary, I
                                    understand, to what would have been the case had the will been
                                    valid, to his heir-at-law, George Augustus William Curzon, and
                                    they now belong to Earl Howe, the head of the Curzon family. Mr.
                                    Jennens’s personal property passed to his cousins, and part of
                                    it now belongs to Earl Beauchamp and others.</p>
                                <p>From that day to this there have been periodical attempts on the
                                    part of real or imaginary connections of Mr. Jennens to
                                    dispossess the actual owners of his estates. The case has been
                                    repeatedly before the courts and the decision has invariably
                                    been <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0327"/>against the
                                    claimants. The most recent occasion, I believe, was the case of
                                    “Willis and others <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Earl Howe and
                                    others,” in November, 1880, before Vice-Chancellor Malins, who,
                                    in giving judgment against the claimants, is said to have
                                    remarked, “If such a claim could be allowed after a period of
                                    eighty-two years, no one would be safe in possession of his
                                    property.”</p>
                                <p>A similar case to this is the “Hedges estate,” claims to which
                                    are frequently addressed to the legation.</p>
                                <p>The deputy governor of the Bank of England wrote to us, in
                                    reference to this, not long since, that he had “caused a careful
                                    search to be made in the books of the bank, and no trace of any
                                    funds standing in the name of Sir Charles Hedges can be
                                    discovered,” Our fellow-countryman the late Colonel Chester, a
                                    genealogist of great repute, carefully investigated this claim,
                                    and reported that Sir Charles Hedges’s will was duly proved by
                                    his son William, who inherited all his property and left a
                                    number of descendants; therefore, if Sir Charles left an
                                    unclaimed estate in the Bank of England, it was not for want of
                                    legal heirs.</p>
                                <p>The claims to the two estates which I have described at some
                                    length, those to the “Bradford estate,” the “Hyde estate,” the
                                    “Home estate,” and to many others, may each be described, in
                                    Colonel Chester’s words, as “one of the ordinary myths by which
                                    so many of our countrymen have been beguiled.”</p>
                            <p>(2) We receive frequent applications for large deposits said to be
                                    awaiting claimants in the Bank of England, and also inquiries
                                    with regard to unclaimed stocks and dividends in the Bank of
                                    England, the dates, when given, being often, if not generally,
                                    anterior to that of the charter of the bank.</p>
                                <p>I recently addressed a letter with regard to a claim of this kind
                                    to the chief accountant of the bank, and he informs me, first of
                                    all, that, in the absence of full particulars (<hi rend="italic"
                                        >i. e.</hi>, the name and address in full, with the
                                    approximate date of the supposed investments) it is impossible
                                    to identify any depositor. Our correspondents very rarely favor
                                    us with these particulars; but they usually state that very
                                    large sums are lying in the bank unclaimed, the fallacy of which
                                    will be shown by the following extract from the chief
                                    accountant’s letter:</p>
                                <p>“There are no large amounts of unclaimed stock or dividends
                                    standing in our [the Bank of England’s] books. Speaking
                                    generally, without having made an exhaustive research, which
                                    would involve some considerable labor, there are very few
                                    amounts of £1,000, and probably none that exceed this sum by
                                    more than £100 or £200. There are many small amounts both of
                                    stock and dividends, and in order to facilitate there-claiming
                                    of these by the persons entitled to them a memorandum has been
                                    drawn up on the subject,” of which the following is a copy:

                                    the nature of the inquiries constantly made of us [<hi
                                        rend="italic">i. e.</hi>, the bank] from the United States
                                    we have little doubt but, that stories of unclaimed property
                                    existing in the bank are circulated for the purpose of obtaining
                                    fees from the supposed heirs.”</p>
                                <p>There is no limitation to the time during which persons
                                    furnishing satisfactory proof of their title to stock or
                                    dividends transferred to the commissioners for the reduction of
                                    the public debt may reclaim them from the latter. The moment a
                                    claimant appears, full particulars are published in the leading
                                    newspapers of the stock or dividends claimed in that particular
                                    case, and further, claimants are admonished to bring forward
                                    their claims; but unless all the particulars required in the
                                    foregoing memorandum be fully complied with, the attempt to
                                    establish such a claim, however valid it may be, can only result
                                    in signal failure.</p>
                            <p>(3) To judge from the letters received at this legation from the
                                United States in reference to unclaimed funds in chancery, many of
                                our countrymen must imagine that institution to be a depository of
                                incalculable millions, a goodly share of which can be easily
                                withdrawn upon the mere institution of a claim to the same by the
                                American minister, and without requirement by the court of any
                                particulars as to the name of the suit, the relationship of the
                                claimant to the parties mentioned therein, or to the original owner
                                of the estate claimed. It is very rarely that in any communication
                                sent us on this subject a smaller sum is mentioned than “several
                                millions,” and frequently our correspondents state that they are
                                entitled to twenty, fifty, and even more millions.</p>
                        <p>It will doubtless cause surprise and disappointment to such as these to
                            be informed that the whole amount of money in the custody of the court
                            of chancery at the present time is about £84,000,000, of which
                            £83,000,000 belong to <hi rend="italic">owners who are known</hi>,
                            leaving about one million only of unclaimed or dormant funds. According
                            to the last annual statement of the paymaster-general, published
                            pursuant to act of Parliament (35 and.36 Vict., chapter 44, section 20),
                            as to the securities and money appearing by the books at the chancery
                            pay office to be in court at the end of February, 1883, £63,641,655 of
                            the £84,000,000 are invested in Government 3 per cents, and the balance
                            is divided among railway, insurance, and other securities.</p>
                        <p>It is very difficult to obtain accurate information with regard to the
                            unclaimed funds, as, in order to ascertain whether there be any in the
                            court of chancery belonging to the heirs or representatives of a
                            particular estate, it is indispensably necessary that the title of the
                            suit in which such funds have been deposited should be stated. It is
                            quite useless to hope that such information may be obtained by supplying
                            only the name of the original owner of the property. Thus, an estate
                            originally the property of Brown may appear under the name of “Jones <hi
                                rend="italic">v</hi>. Smith,” or “Robinson <hi rend="italic">v</hi>.
                            Jenkins.” Prior to 1872 no list was published periodically of unclaimed
                            funds in chancery, but in that year the “court of chancery funds act”
                            was passed, by the rules of which a list of dormant funds was ordered to
                            be published every three years in the London Gazette. The last list
                            appeared in the form of a supplement to that journal on the 27th of June
                            of this year, a copy of which I append to this report.</p>
                        <p>It will be found of little use to claimants, however, for the reasons
                            aforesaid, and also because the amount in each case is not stated.</p>
                        <p>The following circular will show the steps which must be taken in order
                            to obtain information as to the suits mentioned in this list.</p>

                            during the fifteen years immediately preceding that date, with
                            cross-references to the subtitles of the several accounts, has been

                            the supreme court funds rules of 1884, viz:</p>
                        <p>“‘The paymaster shall not give any information respecting any funds in
                            court mentioned in such list or statement, except upon a request signed
                            by the person applying for such information. If such request be made by
                            a solicitor, such information shall not be given unless the request
                            states the name of the person on whose behalf it is made, and that such
                            person is, in the opinion of the applicant, beneficially interested in
                            such funds. If such request be made by any person other than a
                            solicitor, such information shall not be given, unless the applicant is
                            able to satisfy the paymaster that the request is such as may in the
                            particular case be properly complied with.’</p>
                        <p>“Every petition or summons affecting any money or securities to the
                            credit of a cause, matter, or account inserted in this list should
                            contain a statement that it has been so inserted.</p>
                        <p>“In cases in which the money or securities affected by such petition may
                            amount to or exceed in value £500, a copy of such petition or summons,
                            and notice of all proceedings in court or at chambers, unless the court
                            otherwise directs, should be served on the official solicitor of the
                            supreme court.”</p>
                        <p>“In addition to the three classes which I have described at length, there
                            are also unclaimed funds in the shape of dividends in bankruptcy,
                            surplus assets of companies, dividends generally, army and navy prize
                            money; but as the legation rarely, if ever, receives any claims to such
                            as these, I do not deem it necessary to furnish any particulars in
                            reference to them. The same rules with regard to identification and full
                            details as to right of claimant are absolutely indispensable to
                            establish a claim.</p>
                        <p>With regard to wills, it may be well to state that, prior to the passing
                            of the probate act, they were admitted to probate and filed in local
                            courts, chiefly under the jurisdiction of the bishops, and vast numbers
                            of old wills are still to be found at York, Chester, Lichfield, and
                            other cathedral cities.</p>
                        <p>For this reason a search for walls admitted to probate more than thirty
                            years ago is often attended with great difficulty. They are now proved
                            in the district registries or at the principal registry of the probate
                            division of the high court of justice. Copies of wills proved since 1858
                            in the district registries are sent up to the principal registry at
                            Somerset House, London, where they are easy of access on the payment of
                            a small fee, and copies of them may be obtained at a very reasonable
                            cost.</p>
                        <p>In Scotland wills are registered at the commissaries’ court for each
                            county, and also in the commissaries’ office in Edinburgh; in Ireland,
                            at the different district registries and at the principal registry
                            office at Dublin.</p>
                        <p>I append a memorandum issued by the authorities at Somerset House to
                            assist those who are in search of wills and records of marriages and
                            deaths.</p>
                        <p>From the foregoing report I trust it will be thoroughly understood (1)
                            that the time of anyone wishing to prosecute claims to an estate in
                            Great Britain will be wasted by addressing the legation on the subject,
                            and (2) that if those who happen to imagine, from some advertisement or
                            for any other reason, that an estate is awaiting them in this country,
                            wish to save themselves much unnecessary outlay and the pain of hope
                            long deferred, they will address an inquiry upon the subject to any well
                            known and trustworthy solicitors, and not to any of the “agents”
                            previously described, who, in England certainly, and I doubt not in our
                            own country also, derive a large income from the fictitious lists which
                            they publish of unclaimed property, and from the fees paid to them for
                            the investigation of claims to estates which have no existence
                            whatever.</p>

                            concessions of alike nature have been granted by this Government since
                            1875. In December of that year the President, in his annual message to
                            Congress, after the subject had received mature executive consideration,
                            submitted these conditions as the terms upon which he would consent to
                            grant to foreign companies the privilege of landing cables on the shores
                            of the United States until Congress should enact general laws in regard
                            to such privilege, or the President should be otherwise directed by that

                            Vancouver Island and open a telegraph office in Victoria, British
                            Columbia,” but that in every such case the requests have remained

                            Victoria, British Columbia, will, on proper application, and subject, if
                            deemed essential by the Dominion Government, to similar conditions to

                            <p>The electric telegraph has become an essential and indispensable
                                agent in the transmission of business and social messages. Its
                                operation on land, and within the limit of particular States, is
                                necessarily under the control of the jurisdiction within which it
                                operates. These lines on the high seas, however, are not subject to
                                the particular control of any one Government.</p>
                            <p>In 1869 a concession was granted by the French Government to a
                                company which proposed to lay a cable from the shores of France to
                                the United States. At that time there was a telegraphic connection
                                between the United States and the continent of Europe (through the
                                possessions of Great Britain at either end of the line), under the
                                control of an association which had, at large outlay of capital and
                                at great risk, demonstrated the practicability of maintaining such
                                means of communication. The cost of correspondence by this agency
                                was great, possibly not too large at the time for a proper
                                remuneration for so hazardous and so costly an enterprise. It was,
                                however, a heavy charge upon a means of communication which the
                                progress in the social and commercial intercourse of the world found
                                to be a necessity, and the obtaining of this French concession
                                showed that other capital than that already invested was ready to
                                enter into competition, with assurance of adequate return for their
                                outlay. Impressed with the conviction that the interests, not only
                                of the United States, but of the world at large, demanded, or would
                                demand, the multiplication of such means of communication between
                                separated continents, I was desirous that the proposed connection
                                should be made; but certain provisions of this concession were
                                deemed by me to be objectionable, particularly one which gave for a
                                long term of years the exclusive right of telegraphic communication
                                by submarine cable between the shores of France and the United
                                States. I could not concede that any power should claim the right to
                                land a cable on the shores of the United States and at the same time
                                deny to the United States, or to its citizens or grantees, an equal
                                right to land a cable on its shores.</p>
                            <p>The right to control the conditions for the laying of a cable within
                                the jurisdictional waters of the United States, to connect our
                                shores with those of any foreign state, pertains exclusively to the
                                Government of the United States, under such limitations and
                                conditions as Congress may impose. In the absence of legislation by
                                Congress, I was unwilling, on the one hand, to yield to a foreign
                                state the right to say that its grantees might land on our shores,
                                while it denied a similar right to our people to land on its shores;
                                and, on the other hand, I was reluctant to deny to the great
                                interests of the world and of civilization the facilities of such
                                communication as were proposed. I therefore withheld any resistance
                                to the landing of the cable, on condition that the offensive
                                monopoly feature of the concession be abandoned, <pb n="232"
                                    xml:id="pg_232" facs="0332"/>and that the right of any cable
                                which may be established by authority of this Government to land
                                upon French territory, and to connect with French land lines, and
                                enjoy all the necessary facilities or privileges incident to the use
                                thereof upon as favorable terms as any other company, be conceded.
                                As the result thereof the company in question renounced the
                                exclusive privilege, and the representative of France was informed
                                that, understanding this relinquishment to be construed as granting
                                the entire reciprocity and equal facilities which had been demanded,
                                the opposition to the landing of the cable was withdrawn. The cable,
                                under this French concession, was lauded in the month of July, 1869,
                                and has been an efficient and valuable agent of communication
                                between this country and the other continent. It soon passed under
                                the control, however, of those who had the management of the cable
                                connecting Great Britain with this continent, and thus whatever
                                benefit to the public might have ensued from competition between the
                                two lines was lost, leaving only the greater facilities of an
                                additional line, and the additional security in case of accident to
                                one of them. But these increased facilities and this additional
                                security, together with the control of the combined capital of the
                                two companies, gave also greater power to prevent the future
                                construction of other lines, and to limit the control of telegraphic
                                communication between the two continents to those possessing the
                                lines already laid. Within a few months past a cable has been laid,
                                known as the United States Direct Cable Company, connecting the
                                United States directly with Great Britain. As soon as this cable was
                                reported to be laid and in working order, the rates of the then
                                existing consolidated companies were greatly reduced. Soon, however,
                                a break was announced in this new cable, and immediately the rates
                                of the other line, which had been reduced, were again raised. This
                                cable being now repaired, the rates appear not to be reduced by
                                either line from those formerly charged by the consolidated
                                companies.</p>
                            <p>There is reason to believe that large amounts of capital, both at
                                home and abroad, are ready to seek profitable investment in the
                                advancement of this useful and most civilizing means of intercourse
                                and correspondence. They await, however, the assurance of the means
                                and conditions on which they may safely be made tributary to the
                                general good.</p>
                            <p>As these cable-telegraph lines connect separate states, there are
                                questions as to their organization and control, which probably can
                                be best, if not solely, settled by conventions between the
                                respective states. In the absence, however, of international
                                conventions on the subject, municipal legislation may secure many
                                points which appear to me important, if not indispensable, for the
                                protection of the public against the extortions which may result
                                from a monopoly of the right of operating cable telegrams, or from a
                                combination between several lines: <list>

                            Zanzibar of the capture of a slave dhow with one hundred and forty-nine
                            slaves on board, by the King of Johanna, whose loyal action in this
                            affair is much praised.</p>
                        <p>King Abdallah states that he had examined the owner and captain of the
                            dhow, who affirmed that he had brought the slaves for Dr. Wilson, an
                            American citizen owning an estate called “Patsy” in Zanzibar.</p>
                        <p>The slaves captured and freed were mostly Maknas, shipped by a
                            slave-dealer residing at Angona, on the Mozambique coast.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that the
                            attention of Earl Granville has been called to the following
                            circumstances, whereby the expenses of the burial of a seaman who had
                            been discharged from the United States Navy, and who died in a destitute
                            state in the general hospital at Yokohama, on the 23d May last, were
                            defrayed out of the British consular chest. It would appear that Her
                            Majesty’s consul having found among the papers belonging to the deceased
                            a continuous-service certificate issued under the United States Navy
                            regulations, he suggested to the hospital authorities that they should
                            apply to the <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0334"/>United States
                            consul-general as to whether the holding of such a certificate did not
                            fix the holder with American citizenship. To this application General
                            Van Buren replied in the negative, adding that he had no authority to
                            relieve United States men-of-war’s men when discharged, even in cases
                            where their United States citizenship was beyond doubt.</p>
                        <p>The question was then referred to the United States naval authorities,
                            their reply being that once a continuous-service certificate lapses the
                            holder loses all claim to assistance. Her Majesty’s consul, in reporting
                            this case, points out that the claim for the payment of burial fees may
                            have been more fairly made on the British than on the United States
                            authorities, inasmuch as the deceased was a native of Ireland; but in
                            view of the numerous instances of seamen of British nationality serving
                            on board United States ships of war, some of whom have retained their
                            nationality while others may have accepted United States citizenship,
                            Her Majesty’s Government would be glad to learn how the United States
                            regard the question, and Earl Granville has consequently instructed me
                            to invite the expression of their opinion on the subject.</p>

                                Mountain, in the Northwest Territories (a remnant numbering 600 of
                                the band of the American chief Sitting Bull), who fled to this
                                country after the massacre of General Custer and his command, and
                                who returned to the United States in the summer of 1881, have
                                intimated their willingness to return also to the United States
                                provided a guarantee be given them that they will be treated as the

                                received from the United States authorities, that authority be given
                                to the Indian commissioner for the Northwest Territories to treat
                                with these Indians with a view to their early return to the United

                            receipt of your note of the 13th instant, in which you state that Her
                            Majesty’s Government has received information that the Egyptian
                            Government is about to address a circular to the powers parties to the
                            system of mixed tribunals in Egypt proposing the prolongation of those
                            tribunals for the further period of five years, and that you are
                            instructed by Lord Granville to say that your Government is ready to
                            assent to the proposal on the same condition as on the occasion of the
                            last prolongation of the tribunals, viz, subject to the immediate
                            application of such reforms as the powers may in the mean time agree
                            upon.</p>
                        <p>Thanking you for the above information, I have to say in reply that when
                            the Khedive’s Government makes the proposal this Government will
                            probably be prepared to instruct its agent at Cairo in much the same

                            <p>The committee of the privy council have had under consideration a
                                dispatch dated 6th of October, 1883, from Her Majesty’s minister at
                                Washington, transmitting a note, dated September 28 last, and
                                inclosures, from the Hon. Mr. Frelinghuysen, with respect to the
                                application of the Canadian Government for the laying of a cable to
                                connect the Canadian telegraphic system with the Puget Sound
                                Telegraph Company’s lines to Seattle and the United States
                                Government line to Cape Flattery.</p>
                            <p>The minister of public works, to whom the dispatch in question and
                                inclosures were referred, reports that this permission was not
                                desired with a view of establishing a telegraph station within
                                American territory, nor with the intention of entering into
                                competition with either the United States Government or the Puget
                                Sound Telegraph Company.</p>
                            <p>The minister observes that among the inclosures is a letter from Dr.
                                Minor, president of the Puget Sound Telegraph Company, urging upon
                                the United States Government to refuse this permission, and stating
                                that similar privileges requested from the Canadian Government had
                                not been accorded to his company.</p>
                            <p>The minister represents that the privileges asked by Dr. Minor were
                                not only to land cables on the shores of British Columbia, and then
                                connect with established lines, but also to open an independent
                                station at Victoria, and then to enter into competition with the
                                Canadian Government system of telegraphy via the New Westminster and
                                the boundary-line route to the same town of Seattle.</p>
                            <p>The minister further reports that all other conditions submitted by
                                the United States Government with a view to granting this permission
                                are unobjectionable, and he recommends that the fact be brought to
                                the consideration of the honorable the Secretary of State for the
                                United States that any company or person can, upon proper
                                application, subject, of course, to such rules and regulations as

                                lines.</p>

                            receipt of your note of the 23d of November, in relation to the capture
                            in April last, by the King of Johanna, of a slave dhow with a large
                            number of slaves on board, which the master of the vessel was in the act
                            of delivering to one Dr. Wilson, the owner of an estate called “Patsy”
                            in Zanzibar, and which the master of the dhow stated had been bought for
                            Dr. Wilson, who is alleged to be a citizen of the United States.</p>
                        <p>From whatever standpoint the matter may be viewed, the conduct of the
                            King of Johanna appears to have been praiseworthy and humane.</p>
                        <p>It is the settled policy of this Government to discountenance in every
                            way that it properly can any connection of citizens of the United States
                            with the holding of slaves or the traffic in them. When, however,
                            American citizens place themselves outside of the jurisdiction of their
                            country and its laws a difficulty arises in attempting to deal with
                            them.</p>

                            to his connection with the traffic in slaves or with the system of
                            slavery in any of its forms. When the consul’s report shall have been
                            received I <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0338"/>will lay it before

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my reply of the 10th
                            ultimo to your note of the 2d of that month, concerning the application
                            of the Canadian authorities to land a telegraph cable in Washington
                            Territory, I now have the honor to inform you that it appears, from
                            inquiries which this Government has made in reference to the matter,
                            that the granting of the desired permission would make the Canadian line
                            a competing one with the Puget Sound Telegraph Company’s line, and would
                            place the latter company at a disadvantage unless it should not only be
                            permitted to land a cable at Victoria, but to establish local offices in
                            the Dominion for the reception of business there.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances, therefore, the President adheres to the
                            requirements set forth in my note to you of the 28th of September
                            last.</p>

                            regard to the application of the Canadian authorities to land a cable
                            “for the purpose of connecting the Canadian Government telegraph system
                            near Victoria, <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0339"/>Vancouver
                            Island, and Point Angelos, Washington Territory, there to connect with

                            States Government line to Cape Flattery,” I have now the honor, in
                            further reply to your note of the 2d of January last on that subject, to
                            note the observation of the committee of the Dominion privy council in
                            the copy of the minute of that body which you inclose with your note, in
                            which the committee say: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>That any company or person can, upon proper application, subject,
                                    of course, to such rules and regulations as may be necessary to
                                    prevent competition for telegraph business within the province
                                    of British Columbia, obtain permission from the Canadian
                                    Government to land cables on its shores and there connect with
                                    their established lines.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Am I correct in assuming from the passage I have quoted that the Dominion
                            Government owns and controls the “Canadian telegraph system,” including
                            the line which is the subject of the present application’? If that line
                            is owned and controlled by private individuals or by a private
                            corporation, there might be danger that, after the Puget Sound Company
                            had connected with the Canadian line in British Columbia, such obstacles
                            might be thrown in its way, in the legitimate prosecution of its
                            business, as to render the connection useless, or at least detrimental
                            or disadvantageous, to the Puget Sound Company.</p>
                        <p>The Dominion Government say, in the minutes of the privy council, that
                            “all other conditions [except that regarding the Puget Sound Company]
                            submit ted by the United States Government are unobjectionable.” If this
                            Government can receive through you from the Dominion Government
                            assurances that the Puget Sound Company, upon connecting with the
                            Canadian line on the shores of British Columbia, will be afforded equal
                            advantages, privileges, and facilities in the transaction of its own
                            proper business and the prompt and regular transmission of its messages
                            with those accorded to or possessed by the managers of the Canadian line
                            in British Columbia, or with those which may be granted to any other
                            connecting cable, the President directs me to say that the privilege now
                            asked by the Canadian authorities to land their cable on the shores of
                            the United States in Washington Territory will be at once accorded to
                            the Dominion Government, in accordance with my note of the 28th of
                            September last.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my reply of the 20th of
                            December last to your note of the 12th of that month, with reference to
                            the removal of the remnant of Sitting Bull’s band of Sioux Indians from
                            Canada back to the United States, I now have the honor to inform you
                            that no action looking to the return of these Indians to this country
                            can be taken by the Interior Department until an appropriation shall
                            have been made by Congress, there being no fund at present available for
                            their care and support. In view of this fact, my colleague the Secretary
                            of the Interior has submitted the subject to the proper committee of
                            Congress, <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0340"/>and has asked for an
                            appropriation to enable him to take charge of the Indians in question in
                            case satisfactory arrangements can be made for their return, provided
                            that in no event shall this Government be required to receive them till
                            the spring opens.</p>
                        <p>Adding that should Congress take favorable action in reference to the
                            appropriation which has been asked for, this Government will be prepared
                            at the proper time to receive the remnant of Sitting Bull’s band, and to
                            give them a guarantee of indemnity for passed offenses in case they
                            agree to return to this country and behave themselves,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to your note of the 30th of
                            November last, in which you refer to the case of a seaman of British
                            nativity who died at Yokohama, Japan, in May, 1883, having in his
                            possession a continuous-service certificate of the United States Navy,
                            and request the views of this Department as to whether seamen of British
                            nativity discharged from United States naval vessels and in a destitute
                            condition in foreign ports should be relieved by the American Government
                            or that of Great Britain, in reply I have the honor to inform you that
                            upon the receipt of your note the attention of the American consul at
                            Yokohama was called to the matter. A report has now been received from
                            him, from which it appears that John Devany, the seaman in question, was
                            discharged from the naval service of the United States in February,
                            1880, more than three years prior to the date of his death, which
                            occurred on the 23d of May, 1883. The mere fact that this man had at one
                            time served in the American Navy would not seem to place this Government
                            under obligations to defray his funeral expenses, upon his death, years
                            afterwards, even had he been an American citizen. The continuous-service
                            certificate found in the possession of this man cannot be regarded as
                            creating any such obligation, as such certificates are issued to
                            enlisted men in the United States Navy entitled to an honorable
                            discharge, and are intended to encourage good men to continue in the
                            service by enabling them to re-enlist with increased pay, and to secure
                            other benefits accruing after a period of continuous service.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the general subject, a seaman enlisting in the American
                            Navy within the geographical limits of the United States is entitled,
                            upon the expiration of the term of his enlistment, to be returned to a
                            port upon the Atlantic or Pacific coast, according to circumstances, or
                            may, at his option, receive his discharge at a foreign port, unless the
                            public interests require that he shall be temporarily retained in the
                            service. When his enlistment occurs without the limits referred to, he
                            has no option as to the place of discharge, but may, in the discretion
                            of the proper commanding officer, be discharged at a foreign port or
                            temporarily retained in the service. If, in the case of enlistment in
                            the United States, the seaman elects to be discharged at a foreign port,
                            he thereby waives the right of transportation to the United States.
                            Under those regulations <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0341"/>it is
                            not probable that eases of the discharge of seamen from American naval
                            vessels in foreign ports in a destitute condition will often occur.</p>
                        <p>As to the case under consideration, it would seem that the moral
                            obligations to defray the expenses of the burial of the deceased attach
                            rather to the representative of the Government of which he had always
                            been a subject than to that of the Government to which he had only
                            rendered temporary service, for which he had received due
                            compensation.</p>

                            herewith a certified copy of a report by the committee of the privy
                            council of Canada, with a copy of a dispatch from the
                            lieutenant-governor of British Columbia, inclosing a report by the
                            attorney general of that Province, which I have received from the
                            Marquis of Lansdowne.</p>
                        <p>These papers have reference to a case of lynching which has recently
                            occurred at Sumass, in British Columbia.</p>
                        <p>It will be seen from the report of the lieutenant-governor that the
                            Indian prisoner, Lem Tarn, who was the victim of this outrage, was
                            forcibly rescued from the officers of the law and put to death under
                            circumstances of great atrocity, and that the persons by whom this
                            outrage was committed are believed to have entered the territory of
                            British Columbia from the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Marquis of Lansdowne has therefore requested me to bring this case to
                            the notice of the United States Government, in the hope that measures
                            may be taken for the punishment of the criminals, should it be
                            ascertained that they entered British Columbia from the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The Marquis of Lansdowne at the same time expresses his satisfaction at
                            the readiness manifested by the governor of Washington Territory to
                            co-operate cordially with the executive of the Province of British
                            Columbia in endeavoring to bring them to justice.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 2d instant I had the honor of
                                telegraphing to you to the effect that on the night of the 27th
                                ultimo a body of men from the neighboring Washington Territory of
                                the United States had crossed the boundary line between that country
                                and British Columbia, and at a place called “York’s,” at Sumass, in
                                New Westminster district, had taken from the custody of the law an
                                Indian named Lem Tam, who was charged with the murder of one James
                                Bell, at Nooksachk, Wash., and had assassinated him by hanging.</p>
                            <p>I have allowed a few days to elapse before writing on the subject, in
                                the hope of having some definite information to forward as to the
                                identity of some of those who committed this unparalleled outrage,
                                but I regret to say that up to the present time we have been unable,
                                with our best endeavors, to fasten the crime on any one or any
                                number of persons.</p>
                            <p>Immediately on the receipt of the first intelligence of what had
                                occurred, the superintendent of police was dispatched to Sumass, and
                                under his direction an inquest was held on the body of the Indian,
                                when the following verdict was found: “That Louie Tam, an Indian,
                                being a prisoner in the hands of special constables at Sumass, in
                                the Province of British Columbia, was, on the night of the 27th day
                                of February, 1884, forcibly taken from the said special constables
                                by a party of men supposed to be from the United States territory,
                                and by them taken and hanged by the neck until he was dead, upon a
                                tree about 500 feet north of the boundary line between British
                                Columbia and the United States of America, on the telegraph line,
                                being within the Province of British Columbia.”</p>
                            <p>I regret to learn that there was an evident disinclination on the
                                part of the jury to fix the guilt of the act committed on any
                                parties, and that they even insist in their verdict that the party
                                of men were “<hi rend="italic">supposed</hi> to be from the United
                                States territory,” when there could apparently be no doubt as to
                                whence they came.</p>
                            <p>A report is current that it is now thought that the unfortunate
                                Indian had nothing <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0343"/>to do
                                with the murder of Bell, but that the man from Washington Territory
                                who first tried to fix the guilt upon him was himself implicated;
                                and, further, that Robert C. Beckenridge, who laid the information
                                against the Indian, was the person who headed the mob that
                                subsequently seized and hung him.</p>
                            <p>I inclose herewith a copy of the report of my attorney-general to
                                myself on the subject. Immediately that the fact of the committal of
                                the outrage became known to me, I caused the governor of Washington
                                Territory, Mr. Newell, to be communicated with, and also the
                                prosecuting attorney for the district from which the body of men
                                came. Both gentlemen at once expressed their readiness to do what
                                they could towards the investigation of the matter, and promised
                                that their police should assist in every way, but I have but little
                                hope of being able to bring it home to any persons.</p>
                            <p>The men engaged in the outrage were all disguised and the deed was
                                done at night. A case of “lynching” has never before occurred in
                                British Columbia. The people have always felt that justice should
                                follow the usual course, and the fact is that justice has always
                                been promptly and fairly dealt out to those charged with crime. It
                                is therefore not to be wondered at that there is popular indignation
                                felt and expressed at what has occurred, and although in one sense
                                it is satisfactory to feel that the outrage was not committed by
                                British subjects, yet, on the other hand, it is intolerable that
                                foreigners should have dared to cross the boundary to commit it, and
                                that the probability is that the offenders will escape
                                punishment.</p>
                            <p>I shall not fail to exert all efforts to obtain further evidence and
                                information, and while I do not presume to offer any observations as
                                to the course to be pursued by the Government of the Dominion, yet I
                                may express my confidence that that Government will pay all due
                                attention to so grave a matter, and make such representations upon
                                it to the Government of the United States as the circumstances of
                                the case require.</p>

                            a view to its being brought by you to the attention of the
                            Governor-General of Canada, a copy of a letter recently received by this
                            Department from Mr. Henry McMorran, general manager of the Port Huron
                            and Northwestern Railway, in relation to a ferry privilege granted in
                            August of last year by the municipal authorities of Sarnia, Canada, to
                            Mr. James Lockhead, conferring on him the exclusive ferry privileges for
                            twenty-seven years between that town and Port Huron, on the opposite
                            American shore.</p>
                        <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0344"/>
                        <p>It seems, further, from the statements of Mr. McMorran’s letter, that the
                            right to grant such exclusive privilege is claimed by Sarnia under a
                            provision in the charter granted twenty-three years ago; and by the
                            local by-laws and municipal regulations of Port Sarnia, it seems also
                            that heavy penalties and personal arrest and imprisonment are demanded
                            against vessels and masters of such vessels, other than British,
                            entering that port without going through the formalities of custom-house
                            entry and clearance.</p>
                        <p>By the existence of the exclusive privilege referred to, and the
                            enforcement of these municipal regulations, ferry-boats owned by
                            American citizens at Port Huron are excluded from the privilege of
                            plying between that port and Port Sarnia. While it is not doubted that
                            the municipal authorities of Port Sarnia, or the Dominion or provincial
                            government, may grant such a privilege to any subject of Her Majesty in
                            Ontario or any other part of the British North American possessions,
                            excluding all other citizens of the Province of Ontario or the Dominion
                            of Canada, it is conceived that the application of the rule to citizens
                            of the United States is in contravention of the spirit and letter of the
                            treaties on the subject between the two nations from 1783 down to that
                            of 1842, in all of which the navigation of the waters forming the
                            boundary line between the United States and Her Majesty’s North American
                            possessions, by the vessels of both countries, is contemplated and
                            provided for on an entirely free and equal footing.</p>
                        <p>Ferry-boats on these waters must, of course, comply with such regulations
                            as may be properly made by the local municipal authorities of the
                            adjacent neighboring cities or towns on each side of the boundary
                            between which they ply; but these regulations, it is contended by this
                            Government, should be common to the boats of the United States and
                            Canada. Any other view than this of the existing treaty stipulations
                            would, it is believed, lead to practices which could not be otherwise
                            looked upon than as an obstruction to commerce. I need not observe to
                            you that in case the municipal authorities of Port Huron, under such
                            power as it might be vested with by the legislature of Michigan, should
                            adopt a similar course to that inaugurated by the authorities of Port
                            Sarnia, it could only result in giving rise to a state of unfriendly and
                            unneighborly feeling between the two municipalities, which both this
                            Government and that of Her Majesty entertain a common and earnest desire
                            to obviate at all times. I deem it entirely unnecessary to enter into
                            any extended discussion of the subject, believing, as I do, that this
                            simple suggestion of the matter to the Governor-General, through you,
                            will secure the adoption of such measures as will remedy the existing
                            evil and remove the cause of complaint now presented on the part of the
                            Port Huron municipality.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: A controversy has arisen at this
                                point in relation to a ferry franchise between this city and the
                                village of Sarnia, on the opposite shore, in the Dominion of Canada,
                                by the village of Sarnia granting to a man named James Lockhead the
                                exclusive right to ferry between that village and this city for a
                                period of twenty-seven <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0345"
                                />years from August, 1883, under a special act granted to that
                                village by the Governor-General of the Province of Canada some
                                twenty-three years ago. We have four boats, engaged in the ferry
                                business, and is the only ferry line that has existed continually
                                between the two points for the last thirty years. We-desire to know
                                whether the village of Sarnia has the power to grant an exclusive
                                franchise of this nature, thereby shutting off our boats from
                                landing on that side, without conflicting with some of the
                                international treaties in existence. I understand that our United
                                States statutes allow ferry-boats to land here without clearing and
                                reporting, which would give them free access to our side, while our
                                boats are shut out from landing on their side by their local by-law,
                                which provides for the arrest of the officer of any boat landing on
                                that side except boats controlled by this Lockhead, and fining them,
                                in the discretion of their village magistrate, from $20 to $50 for
                                each landing, which is prohibitory to our boats. Any information you
                                can give me will be duly appreciated.</p>

                            <p>It appears that a person named Bell was murdered by some party or

                            <p>The Indian boy was arrested on suspicion, and, whilst in the hands of
                                the constable at Sumass, was seized by an armed mob from the United

                            <p>I considered it proper to bring the matter to the notice of the

                                request of 127 Indians, the statement they made to me at a meeting
                                they held at Squehalo on Monday and Tuesday last to consider the
                                action of some Americans who came to Sumass and took an Indian boy
                                named Lewey, fifteen years old, and lynched him. I had great
                                trouble, for the time they were in council, to restrain them from
                                going in a body across the boundary line to Nooksachk and taking the
                                first white man they met and taking him to the spot where the Indian
                                boy was hanged and treating him in the same manner.</p>
                            <p>The Indians were fully prepared for a start at any moment they got
                                the word from their headmen.</p>
                            <p>I had been very lucky to be there in time to prevent them from going.
                                There was a delegation from every band on the Fraser River from Yale
                                to Langley at the meeing. They were burning with anger. They are
                                positively under the impression that a white man named Heisterman,
                                telegraph operator at Nooksachk, murdered Bell, and then organized a
                                mob and led them across the Sumass to lynch the Indian boy, so as to
                                screen his own guilt. I succeeded in sending them all back to their
                                homes, promising them that Her Majesty’s Government would look after
                                the matter and would bring the parties to justice if they could,
                                possibly be found.</p>
                            <p>I hope you will be good enough to write me a letter on the subject
                                that will be pleasing to them, which I may read to them at their
                                next meeting, which will be early in May.</p>

                                took an innocent Indian boy fifteen years of age and, without, five
                                minutes’ warning, lynched him to the next tree they met.</p>
                            <p>We want you to take the few words we have to say down on paper and
                                send it to Superintendent Powell. He always has been our good
                                friend. We know he will be grieved at what the white men have done

                            <p>We are all unanimous that we are fully justified in going
                                immediately, in very large numbers, across the boundary lice, and
                                take the first white men we meet and bring them to the very spot
                                where they hung the Indian and treat them in the same manner. We
                                hope you will agree with our decision. There are a good many of our
                                men here present who objected to letting you know anything about
                                their intention until it was all over, but the majority of us
                                decided to tell you everything and take your advice. We request that
                                Dr. Powell will let the Government at Ottawa know how sick our
                                hearts are.</p>
                            <p>From what you have just said to us last evening we feel some
                                consolation, and we all promise you that we will go back to our
                                homes and leave the matter at present in the hands of the Dominion
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>We hope you will meet us again about the 1st of May.</p>

                                letter from Mr. P. McTiernan, Indian agent at Eraser River, relative
                                to the outrage committed by some white men who came across the
                                boundary line to Sumass and forcibly took an Indian boy of this
                                province, aged only fifteen years, from the custody of a constable
                                and hung him, and also the statement of a number of chiefs,
                                representatives from various tribes on the Eraser, who, by
                                arrangement, bad met to consider the best means of obtaining
                                justice.</p>
                            <p>The Eraser River Indians are not only industrious and progressive,
                                but have been a law-abiding people, and it is of great importance to
                                show them that the Government will take vigorous measures to redress
                                their grievances and punish wrong-doing,</p>
                            <p>If the impression they now have, that the boy who was sacrificed to a
                                mob was innocent of the crime with which he was charged, be correct,
                                the injury which has been inflicted upon them is all the more
                                painful and deserving of the sympathy and attention of the
                                authorities.</p>
                            <p>May I ask if you will have the goodness to bring this complaint to
                                the notice of the lieutenant-governor in council, and to acquaint me
                                in due course, for the information of the Indians, of the steps
                                taken in regard to the same?</p>

                                referring to the recent lamentable outrage committed at Sumass
                                presumably by a mob from the adjacent United States territory.</p>
                            <p>In reply I have to say that no time was lost by this Government in
                                bringing the matter to the notice of the authorities at Ottawa, by
                                whom, as you are doubtless-aware, proceedings can alone be
                                taken.</p>
                            <p>This Government is deeply impressed with the importance, from every
                                point of view, of adopting energetic measures for the punishment of
                                the perpetrators of that outrage, and I may be permitted to express
                                the hope that you will, by making strong representations to the head
                                of the Indian Department at Ottawa, assist in moving the Dominion

                                inclosing a copy of a note-from the Hon. Mr. Frelinghuysen,
                                Secretary of State for the United States, in regard <pb n="250"
                                    xml:id="pg_250" facs="0350"/>to the application made, under the
                                authority of an order in council of the 13th of June, 1883, by the
                                Canadian Government, through Her Majesty’s minister at Washington,
                                for permission to land a cable upon the shores of Washington
                                Territory to connect the Canadian Government telegraph system near
                                Victoria, Vancouver’s Island, with the telegraph station of the
                                United States Government, or with the Puget Sound or other company’s
                                station, at or near Point Angelos, Washington Territory.</p>
                            <p>The minister of public works, to whom the dispatch and inclosure were
                                referred, observes that the Hon. Mr. Frelinghuysen inquires whether
                                the telegraph system in British Columbia is owned by the Government,
                                as, if the line which is the subject of the application made by the
                                Dominion was controlled by private individuals or by a private
                                corporation, there might be danger that the proposed connections
                                would, if effected, work detrimentally to the business of the Puget
                                Sound Company.</p>
                            <p>The minister further observes that the Hon. Mr. Frelinghuysen,
                                Secretary of State of the United States, states that if his
                                Government can receive from the Dominion Government “assurances that
                                the Puget Sound Company, upon connecting with the Canadian line on
                                the shores of British Columbia, will be afforded equal advantages,
                                privileges, and facilities in the transaction of its own proper
                                business and the prompt and regular transmission of its messages
                                with those accorded to or possessed by the managers of the Canadian
                                line in British Columbia, or with those which may be granted to any
                                other connecting cable,” the privileges now asked by the Canadian
                                authorities will be at once accorded.</p>
                            <p>The minister states that the telegraph system of British Columbia is
                                owned and controlled by the Government of Canada; that the cable
                                from Victoria to Washington Territory will be laid forthwith, and
                                that should the United States Government, the Puget Sound or any
                                other United States company desire to lay a submarine cable from
                                American to Canadian territory, and there connect with the
                                Government telegraph station at, for instance, Victoria, they shall,
                                upon proper application, be free to do so; it being clearly
                                understood, however, that the retransmission and distribution of all
                                messages received through said cable or cables shall, within
                                Canadian territory, be under the exclusive control and direction of
                                the Canadian authorities; and, in like manner, that when the
                                Canadian Government lay a cable between British Columbia and
                                Washington Territory and there connect with the United States
                                Government, the Puget Sound or other company’s station at or near
                                Point Angelos, the retransmission and distribution of all messages
                                conveyed by said cable or cables shall, within American territory,
                                be under the exclusive control and direction of the United States
                                Government, the Puget Sound or other telegraph company; it being
                                furthermore understood that both the Canadian and United States
                                authorities shall, within their respective territories, have the
                                option of forwarding all messages to or from British Columbia either
                                via the Point Angelos or Point Grey cable routes.</p>
                            <p>The committee concur in the report of the minister of public works,

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: I inclose you an order served on
                                Captain Moffatt, of our ferry company between this city and the
                                village of Sarnia, in the Dominion of Canada, requiring us to change
                                our present landing, where the present line of ferry-boats have
                                landed for the last thirty-five years, and go to a private wharf,
                                owned by one James S. Lock-head, who claims to have the exclusive
                                franchise of ferrying between that village and this city, granted to
                                him by the village authorities and conferred upon them by the
                                Dominion of Canada. The Government also have a customs officer
                                stationed at our present landing. This order imposes a heavy expense
                                and annoyance to our ferry company, as well as the public. Is it not
                                a very unusual proceeding for a Government to compel American boats
                                to land at such private wharf as they may designate, in the interest
                                of private individuals? Will you kindly give this matter your early
                                attention and advise us as to our rights in the matter?</p>

                                lynching of the Indian boy Jack by a mob, upon the soil of British
                                Columbia, on the 25th of February, 1884, and beg leave respectfully
                                to state that I have made every possible effort to ascertain who
                                committed the outrage, but without any satisfactory result. I
                                telegraphed, at my own expense, to the governor-general of British
                                Columbia, that I would make diligent search for the perpetrators,
                                and also dispatched to the Hon. C. M. Bradshaw, the prosecuting
                                attorney for that district. He informed me that he instituted the
                                most vigorous proceedings at his command, but had not been able to
                                make any discoveries. This information I have already transmitted to
                                the Department of the Interior.</p>
                            <p>It will be apparent that it is well-nigh impossible to make
                                discoveries of a band of disguised people who, with the entire
                                community, are interested in the secrecy which pertains to such
                                illegal and violent transactions. Again, the country is covered by a
                                dense forest, which precludes the possibility of successful search.
                                Furthermore, many of the people ofttimes make but little account of
                                an Indian’s life when any act, which they assume to justify hanging
                                by a mob has been perpetrated, and are ofttimes not fastidious about
                                the guilt of their action. As governor I have acted <pb n="253"
                                    xml:id="pg_253" facs="0353"/>with all possible zeal and vigor,
                                and can, so far as I know, do nothing more, having no money at my
                                command for that or for any other public purpose.</p>
                            <p>The prosecuting attorney has exhausted his resources of effort. I
                                respectfully recommend that the district attorney of the United
                                States be instructed to undertake the case, and be provided with

                            <p>The state of the labor traffic in the Western Pacific islands has
                                recently engaged the serious attention of the colonial governments
                                interested, and of Her Majesty’s Government, and steps are being
                                taken which it is hoped may tend to lessen the abuses which have
                                arisen.</p>
                            <p>One of the first evils with which they have had to contend is the
                                indiscriminate sale of arms, ammunition, dynamite, and alcohol to
                                the islanders, and in the interests of humanity it is sought to
                                prevent the supply of such articles. They have come to the
                                conclusion that the best way of putting an end to a trade so
                                injurious to the populations <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0354"
                                />of these islands would he by international agreement, to which the
                                great powers and the United States should be parties.</p>
                            <p>Her Majesty’s Government, therefore, would be glad to know whether
                                the Government of the United States would be willing to enter into
                                such an agreement.</p>

                        <p>You will perceive that it is suggested that in order to avoid the risk of

                            before any attempt is made to deal with the subject by legislation on
                            the part of the Dominion, a conference should be held with the United
                            States authorities, whether Federal, State, or municipal, in order that,
                            i possible, joint action may be taken in the matter by both

                            <p>The committee of the privy council have had before them a memorandum,
                                dated 23d October, 1884, from the minister of inland revenue with
                                respect to international ferries plying between Canadian and United
                                States ports.</p>
                            <p>The minister of inland revenue observes that the British North
                                American act determines the exclusive legislative authority in
                                respect of ferries between a province and any British or foreign
                                country, or between two provinces, to rest with the Dominion.
                                Parliament, and that the act respecting ferries (33 Vic, cap. 35)
                                provides that “every license of ferry under that act shall be under
                                the great seal, and shall be issued by the governor in council,
                                after public competition” as thereinafter provided.</p>
                            <p>The minister states that circumstances have arisen in respect both of
                                the Sarnia and Port Huron and the Buffalo and Fort Erie ferries
                                which lead to the conviction that the conditions required by this
                                act may bring the Government of Canada into serious collision with
                                the State or municipal authorities of the United States.</p>
                            <p>The minister is not aware whether the power of legislating for
                                ferries inheres in the Federal or State government, but is of
                                opinion, from what has transpired, that each State has power to
                                enact its own laws, and to delegate the administration of these to
                                municipalities.</p>
                            <p>Assuming, then, that such municipalities have the power to make
                                by-laws equivalent in force and in general conditions to the ferries
                                act of Canada, under which we are acting, a collision would be
                                inevitable unless the parties tendering to this Government were able
                                to negotiate away any opposition which might present itself on the
                                other side of the frontier. Otherwise the condition of affairs which
                                might supervene would be as follows:</p>
                            <p>Canada would grant a monopoly to A, and the United States
                                municipality to B.</p>
                            <p>A alone would have the right to touch upon Canadian territory without
                                going through all the forms of entering and clearing at the
                                custom-house, and otherwise submitting to such restrictions required
                                by the navigation laws as all vessels of foreign ownership are
                                required to do.</p>
                            <p>Should the United States authorities reciprocate, B alone would only
                                be in a like favored position in respect of the other side of the
                                frontier.</p>
                            <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0356"/>
                            <p>Under these conditions the very object of a ferry, that is, rapid
                                transit, would be frustrated, and it would seem, therefore, that
                                some amendment to the ferries act is inevitable as touching
                                international ferries, so as to preclude the competition between
                                individuals for a mere commercial advantage, bringing about serious
                                international misunderstandings.</p>
                            <p>The minister of inland revenue therefore recommends that, before
                                introducing any legislation upon the subject, a conference should be
                                held with the United States authorities, in order that some joint
                                legislation might be agreed upon which should be equally applicable
                                to all international ferries plying between Canadian and United
                                States ports.</p>
                            <p>The committee concur in the recommendation of the minister of inland
                                revenue, and they advise that your excellency be moved to transmit a
                                copy of this minute, if approved, to Her Majesty’s minister at

                                advisable with a view to avoid any difficulty, which it is highly
                                desiraable should not spring up between the Canadian and United

                            approved report of the privy council of Canada upon the subject of
                            international ferries plying between the United States and the Dominion
                            of Canada.</p>
                        <p>With a view to avoid the risks of conflicts likely to arise in the
                            present condition of the law of Canada, and before any attempt is made
                            to settle the complications that have already arisen at Port Huron and
                            other points because of the condition of the ferries act of Canada, it
                            is suggested a conference should be held with the United States
                            authorities in order that some joint action might be agreed upon which
                            should be equally applicable to all international ferries plying between
                            United States and Canadian ports.</p>
                        <p>The suggestion meets with the approval of this Department, and I hasten
                            to inform you that I will at an early day fix a time when I shall be
                            glad to confer with you upon the subject.</p>

                        calling for information touching our pork product from its consul-general at
                        New York and its legation at Berlin. It is trusted that the inquiry at
                        Berlin may involve a statement of the fact that the local German custom,
                        among some classes, of making the raw native product an article of diet, is
                        accountable for whatever serious disturbances to health have lately occurred
                        there as a result of pork consumption. This custom is not understood to
                        obtain in Greece.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that within the
                        last few days the law recently passed by the Chamber for a loan of
                        170,000,000 francs <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0358"/>(about
                        $34,000,000) has been signed by the King and promulgated. The discussion on
                        the law was long and very serious, and before its passage the Chamber
                        remained in session from 3 o’clock in the afternoon until 2 o’clock at
                        night, a thing unprecedented in Greek history.</p>
                    <p>The proceeds of the loan are to be employed exclusively for paying off the
                        debt to the National and Ionian Banks of about $13,700,000, in order to put
                        an end to the forced circulation of bank notes, and for expenditure on
                        railways and on naval and military preparations, for which, by two previous
                        laws of July 4, 1882, and April 12, 1883, permission had been granted to
                        contract loans of $8,000,000 nominal and $2,500,000 effective, respectively.
                        These permissions are replaced by the present loan.</p>
                    <p>The loan is made with the Epiro-Thessalian Bank, the Bank of Constantinople
                        and a syndicate comprising the latter, the Comptoir d’Escompte of Paris, the
                        Société Générale of Paris, the Banque Générale d’Egypte, the Banque de Paris
                        et des Pays Bas, the National Bank of Greece, the Bank of General Credit,
                        and the Industrial Bank of Greece, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>The loan of 170,000,000 francs nominal is divided into 340,000 bonds of 500
                        francs or £20 sterling each, with a yearly interest, payable half-yearly, at
                        the rate of 5 per cent., namely, 25 francs or £1 per bond. It is to be paid
                        off in thirty-seven and a half years, by half-yearly drawings by lot,
                        according to a scale of amortization printed on the back of the bonds. The
                        interest is payable in Athens, Paris, London, and Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As special security for the service of the loan, the Greek Government
                        mortgages the customs revenues of the Piræus, Athens, Patros, Syra,
                        Katakolo, Kalamata, Cephalonia, Zante, and Corfu, the stamp duties, the
                        installments paid for national lands, and the tobacco tax, so far as not
                        previously mortgaged for other loans, and the whole of the customs revenue
                        of Volo, Tzagasi, and Asta.</p>
                    <p>The revenue appropriated to the loan is to be deposited in the offices of the
                        Bank of Constantinople and the Epiro-Thessalian Bank in Greece.</p>
                    <p>The arrangement with the syndicate is so made that they take 55,000,000
                        francs <hi rend="italic">ferme</hi> at the fixed price of 68½, or 342½
                        francs for a bond of 500 francs, and advance immediately after the
                        promulgation 35,000,000 francs ($7,000,000) in gold, in Paris, which is to
                        be used for beginning the resumption of specie payments. Sixty million
                        nominal of the loan the Government reserves for itself to issue, and agrees
                        to open the remainder, 55,000,000 francs, to public subscription, at any
                        time within eighteen months, whenever the Government may think it advisable,
                        the profit above the fixed price of 68½ to be divided between the Government
                        and the syndicate.</p>
                    <p>The loan from the banks of $13,700,000 is to be repaid in three installments
                        within nine months, and specie payments will not be really resumed until the
                        expiration of that time, although we may expect the price of gold constantly
                        to fall.</p>
                    <p>As the loan is not to be put upon the market until specie payments are
                        resumed—in nine months’ time—it is thought that it will be easily taken at a
                        premium on the price issued.</p>
                    <p>There can be but one opinion as to the advisability of resuming specie
                        payments in any country, even if the Government has to suffer a loss, but
                        especially where, owing to a forced circulation, the Government is in the
                        hands of bankers for the purchase of gold necessary to meet their loan and
                        other expenses abroad. This will bring the annual <pb n="259"
                            xml:id="pg_259" facs="0359"/>indebtedness for the purposes of the public
                        debt up to over $6,000,000, which the country is perfectly capable of
                        sustaining, but the increase is outweighed by other advantages.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Some months ago the agent in Greece of the
                        American Bible Society complained to me that his agents and colporteurs in
                        various places in the interior were prevented by the authorities from
                        selling Bibles, thus causing a pecuniary loss to the society.</p>
                    <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0361"/>
                    <p>I subsequently had letters on this subject from the general agent at
                        Constantinople.</p>
                    <p>The agent here, Mr. Kalopothakes, a Greek subject, though educated in America
                        and married to an American, showed me the opinion of legal counsel, which
                        convinced me that such interference with the sale of Bibles in Greece was
                        illegal.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Kalopothakes was at first of opinion that he should take what would
                        certainly be the only proper course for the agent of any commercial
                        establishment in similar circumstances, that is, bring an action in the
                        courts against the offending officials.</p>
                    <p>This, however, the Bible House was unwilling to approve, lest they should
                        seem to force their publications upon the Greek people.</p>
                    <p>A similar case had arisen in 1876, when General Bead succeeded in arranging
                        the affair by an unofficial conversation with the minister [see General
                        Bead’s dispatch No. 219, dated August 3, 1876, and reply of the Department
                        No. 88, dated August 25, 1876]; and, acting on this precedent, I had an
                        unofficial conversation with the prime minister, who promised to look into
                        the matter. I called his attention to the fact that the sale of Bibles was
                        allowed without interference in Athens, in the principal streets, not far
                        from his office, and I thought that no reason could exist for pursuing a
                        different system in the provinces. A similar course was taken by the English
                        chargé d’affaires in behalf of the British and Foreign Bible Society.</p>
                    <p>Some days ago Mr. Kalopothakes again complained to me that a colporteur whom
                        he had sent to Ithaca, instructed to take no books of any kind except
                        Bibles, and to give none away, but simply to sell them, had been stopped and
                        his books seized.</p>
                    <p>He gave me the telegram of his agent announcing this fact. Having occasion
                        that afternoon to see the prime minister, I gave him the telegram, and he
                        promised to telegraph at once to Ithaca and inquire into the facts. He
                        expressed, however, a doubt as to whether they were exactly as had been
                        represented to me.</p>
                    <p>I have informed Mr. Kalopothakes that I do not feel justified in taking
                        further steps in the matter, and certainly not in taking any official
                        action, without positive instructions from you. I have hesitated about
                        bringing the matter before you, thinking it might be preferable that I
                        should be left without instructions. Mr. Kalopothakes has now gone to
                        America, and has the intention of himself representing to the Department the
                        case of the Bible Society.</p>
                    <p>The situation is a delicate one. The Greeks are very sensitive to anything in
                        the matter of proselytism, not only because they love their own church but
                        because their church has been a strong, and perhaps the strongest,
                        instrument in preserving Greek national life and in obtaining their freedom.
                        As they wish to maintain their influence among the Greeks now subject to
                        Turkey, and as the Greek Church is their most powerful arm, any division in
                        the church, or any effort to create dissatisfaction with it, seems an attack
                        against their patriotism.</p>
                    <p>It was for that reason that the first article of the Greek constitution was
                        made to read: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The dominant religion in Greece is that of the orthodox Oriental
                                Christian Church. Every other recognized religion is tolerated, and
                                the full exercise of its worship is protected by the law.
                                Proselytism and any other intervention prejudicial to the dominant
                                religion are forbidden.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>Now, the sale of the Bible, whether in English or in modern Greek, is not
                        forbidden by the constitution or the law, although the modern <pb n="262"
                            xml:id="pg_262" facs="0362"/>Greek translation issued by the American
                        Bible Society, as it is not opposed by the synod, is not allowed to be used
                        in the schools.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>In case you should see fit to give me instructions in this case, I hope they
                        may be to the effect that in a country like Greece, where good tribunals
                        exist, the Bible Society should exhaust its legal remedies before applying
                        to the legation for diplomatic aid, leaving me, however, a certain latitude
                        for unofficial good offices.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my dispatch No. 69, dated March
                        20, with regard to the difficulties of the American Bible Society, I have
                        the honor to report that the prime minister informed me yesterday that the
                        ministry of worship had received a telegram from the Eparch of Ithaca saying
                        that no order had been issued to restrict the sale of the Bibles of the
                        American Society. I have myself seen the telegram.</p>
                    <p>On communicating this to the agent of the British and Foreign Bible Society,
                        who, in the absence of Mr. Kalopothakes, is acting for the American Bible
                        Society, he handed me a telegram from the colporteur at Ithaca asking for
                        further interference on my part to compel the Eparch to instruct the police
                        authorities in the case. I refused to take any further steps at present, for
                        it is evident that the Hellenic Government is pursuing no policy adverse to

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor of acknowledging your
                            attention in submitting to us a memorandum relating to Mr. Schuyler’s
                            dispatch No. 69.</p>
                        <p>We were aware that an appeal had been made to the American minister at
                            Athens to exert his influence for the protection of our employés from
                            maltreatment while engaged in lawful trade, and, knowing something of
                            his success in removing the injunction of the Greek Government against
                            the importation of American hams, we hoped he would be no less firm in
                            the position that American citizens ought to be protected in carrying
                            out their unselfish aims to give every inhabitant of Greece the
                            opportunity to buy, if he will, the Holy Scriptures which are recognized
                            as canonical throughout Christendom.</p>
                        <p>The attitude assumed on previous occasions by our ambassadors and those
                            of Great Britain is believed to be in accordance with the profound
                            convictions of the nation, that the lives and property of men who are
                            engaged in the disinterested work of teaching a pure Christian morality
                            have no less claim upon national protection than the lives and property
                            of those who are engaged in commercial speculations, scientific
                            research, or academic studies. And to meet any misunderstanding or
                            suspicion among the Greeks as to missionary enterprises, Mr. Schuyler
                            might well inform them that while the British and Foreign Bible Society
                            is under the patronage of Her Majesty the Queen of England, the Prince
                            of Wales, and the Emperor of Germany, the American Bible Society also
                            numbers among its officers some of the most eminent of American jurists
                            and civilians, among whom it is not invidious to mention the Chief
                            Justice of the Supreme Court and one of the ex-Presidents of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>So far as those societies are concerned, it is not any part of their
                            object to make proselytes from the Greek Church, nor do they employ men
                            to circulate other books than the Holy Scriptures. If that were the <hi
                                rend="italic">gravamen</hi> of the offense, we should have expected
                            it to be made prominent, but, so far as I can learn, the objection has
                            come from the holy synod that the Holy Scriptures ought not to be
                            allowed to be circulated. The injustice of which we complain is that our
                            employés have been deprived of property and forbidden to prosecute a
                            business which the law allows.</p>
                        <p>I do not know what the opinion of the American minister may be in respect
                            to the advantages which may accrue from the prosecution of this work,
                            but whether it is favorable or not, we judge that our correspondents are
                            entitled to his hearty sympathy and aid, while doing this work, as
                            representatives of the Christian people of America, so long as they do
                            not violate the letter or the spirit of the law; and we confidently hope
                            that Mr. Schuyler will have instructions from the Department of State to
                            give no less support to this work of pure philanthropy than he would to
                            commercial enterprises conducted solely with a view to pecuniary
                            profit.</p>
                        <p>With renewed thanks for the invitation given us to express an opinion on
                            these points,</p>

                            to an extract from a recent letter from Dr. Bliss, under date of May 5,
                            having special reference to the embarrassments which Turkish officials
                            throw in the way of circulating books which are expressly sanctioned by
                            the Government censor. The cases are parallel to those occurring in
                            Greece, and their importance is such as to justify our reference to the
                            State Department, with the request that Mr. Wallace may be suitably
                            instructed to secure protection for our interests so far as it may be in
                            his power.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Word has just come that our excellent
                            colporteur in the Smyrna district was arrested at Denizlu, half way
                            between Aidiu and Isbarta, and sent to Smyrna under guard. Mr. Bowen at
                            once went to Consul Stevens, and the young man was released about 9
                            o’clock at night. His crime was selling books which had received the
                            sanction of the Government and had passed the censor.</p>
                        <p>A letter from Erzeroom informs me, under date of April 18, that a
                            telegram had just been received from Khanoos stating that our colporteur
                            there had been imprisoned for book-selling. Rev. Mr. Chambers went
                            immediately to the governor, and he promised to telegraph for him to be
                            released. Mr. Chambers had no assurance that it would be done. The head
                            of the censorship in Erzeroom was present at the interview with the
                            governor, and interposed his word to the effect that we had already been
                            forbidden to sell books in the villages. The question which has been
                            slumbering in that region since the fall of 1882 will very likely be
                            reopened. Now, what are we to do if an order shall be issued forbidding
                                <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi> our colporteurs to hawk books in the
                            villages? All our Bibles have the permit of the censor and of the
                            central Government in one form or another. All the books of the mission
                            have been approved, also, by the same departments. We have paid duty,
                            &amp;c.</p>

                        February 23, and No. 68, dated March 10, 1884, about the importation of

                        May 19 (31).</p>
                    <p>It will be seen by this note that the importation of American pork is
                        permitted only on a certificate of a Greek consul that no disease exists in
                        the place of origin. This rule is applicable to all importations of pork
                        from every country, and, as it existed at the time when the restriction on
                        American pork was abolished, I had already taken it for granted that it
                        applied also to importations from the United States.</p>

                            viz, that for importing these articles of food it is necessary to have a
                            certificate of the local authorities, approved by the consul of Greece,
                            stating that neither trichinosis nor any contagious malady to which

                        been gathered statements of the registered births and deaths in the Hawaiian
                        Kingdom for the years 1879, 1880, 1881, 1882,” and the first half of 1883.

                        </table></p>
                    <p>Although the deaths above enumerated include the victims of the small-pox
                        visitation in 1881 and 583 lepers at the leper settlement on Molokai, it is
                        nevertheless manifest that the native population is steadily decreasing.
                        There has been a very considerable increase in permanent population,
                        however, since 1878. In addition to a small but steady increase from Europe
                        and America during that time, and the coming of perhaps not less than 10,000
                        Chinese laborers, there have arrived 7,733 Portuguese, principally from the
                        Azores, the most of them during the past eighteen months. A very
                        considerable proportion of the latter are women and children. They are a
                        peaceful, industrious, and prolific people; and as the most of them have
                        come to remain, it is probable that the natural decrease in population
                        (averaging about 400 per annum durring the past four and one-half years)
                        will soon cease.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to apprise you that, on the
                        petition of William R. Castle and other Hawaiian taxpayers, Chief Justice
                        Judd yesterday ordered a writ of mandamus to issue restraining the minister
                        of finance from accepting for the 6 per cent, bonds of the $2,000,000 loan
                        act of 1882 any of the recently coined Hawaiian silver currency, the first
                        installment of which, amounting to $130,000, arrived here from San Francisco
                        on the 9th instant.</p>
                    <p>The loan act authorizes the issuance, for specific purposes, of bonds to the
                        amount of $2,000,000. The bonds are to bear interest at the rate of 6 per
                        cent, per annum, are to be issued at not less than par, and are made
                        payable, principal and interest, “in United States gold coin or its
                        equivalent.” As the bonds did not find ready sale, the Government finally
                        entered into an arrangement with Mr. Claus Spreckels, giving him the
                        privilege of taking the bonds to the amount of a million dollars and paying
                        for them in Hawaiian silver coins at their face value. And it seems to have
                        been further agreed that these Hawaiian coins should be made on the order of
                        Mr. Spreckels, from bullion provided by Mr. Spreckels, and (as authorized by
                        the Legislative Assembly of 1880) “be of equal weight and fineness with
                        United States gold and silver coins of the same value.”</p>
                    <p>Provision was made for this coinage at the United States mints, and on the
                        9th instant the sum of $130,000 in Hawaiian silver coins, principally
                        half-dollars, I believe, was received here by the agents of Mr. Spreckels,
                        to be paid over to the Government for an equal amount in bonds. But the
                        transaction was resisted by certains taxpayers, and a hearing on their
                        petition resulted, as mentioned, in an order to the minister of finance from
                        the chief justice to issue the bonds only for United States gold coin or its
                        equivalent. An appeal to a full bench was noted, but it is not believed that
                        the judgment will be disturbed.</p>
                    <p>Further shipments of the same coinage are expected, and the matter is
                        attracting general attention.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Agreeably to the instruction embraced in your
                        dispatch of November 15, 1883 (No. 38), on the 7th instant (No. 242) I
                        addressed a communication to His Hawaiian Majesty’s minister of foreign
                        affairs, briefly referring to the exclusive permission for the
                        transportation of Chinese laborers to these islands accorded by the Hawaiian
                        Government to the Pacific Mail and Occidental and Oriental Steamship
                        Companies some time in July last; to the transfer of that permission, about
                            <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0367"/>three months thereafter, to the
                        Oceanic Steamship Company; of the alleged proffer by the latter to assign
                        the concession, first, to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, for a
                        consideration, and subsequently to the Occidental and Oriental Steamship
                        Company, a corporation organized under the laws of Great Britain; and
                        claiming that provisions of the treaty of 1849 between the United States and
                        Hawaii forbidding discrimination against the vessels or commerce of the
                        United States had thereby been contravened, and asking the Hawaiian
                        Government to take such measures as would repair and in the future prevent
                        such discrimination.</p>
                    <p>Replying under date of the 10th instant, his excellency the minister of
                        foreign affairs expresses surprise that the Pacific Mail Steamship Company
                        should have appealed to the United States Government for relief. He refers
                        to the many favors accorded that company by the Hawaiian Government; claims
                        that no contract or agreement with that corporation has been violated; that
                        the privilege of transporting Chinese laborers to these islands was
                        transferred to the Oceanic Steamship Company for sanitary and industrial
                        reasons; that the agreement with the Oceanic Steamship Company carried with
                        it no right or warrant of transfer, nor is the Hawaiian Government aware
                        that any such transfer has been proffered; and that he fails to perceive
                        that any discrimination against vessels of the United States has been made
                        by the Hawaiian Government, or that any of the provisions of the treaty of
                        1849 have been contravened.</p>
                    <p>To bring the matter to a more direct issue, I addressed a second
                        communication to his excellency the minister of foreign affairs, on the 13th
                        instant (No. 243), in which, without regarding as essential the facts and
                        circumstances connected with these exclusive contracts, I felt warranted by
                        my instructions in assuming that the substantial cause of complaint was not
                        so much that the agreement had been taken from one company and given to
                        another, either with or without cause, as that it had been made at all; that
                        the making and enforcement of such a contract by the Hawaiian Government
                        with any company owning a particular line of vessels, whether American,
                        Hawaiian, or foreign to both countries,” would be, in the estimation of my
                        Government, repugnant to the covenants of the treaty of 1849, and a hope was
                        expressed that all such discriminating concessions by the Hawaiian
                        Government would be set aside as unauthorized.</p>
                    <p>In reply to this, under date of the 19th instant, his excellency the minister
                        of foreign affairs incloses a copy of the agreement between the Hawaiian
                        Government and the Oceanic Steamship Company, showing that it is not
                        transferable; asserts that the authority for the admission of further
                        Chinese laborers into the Hawaiian Kingdom limits the number to 600 in every
                        three months, and for social, sanitary, and industrial reasons such
                        immigration should be selected by capable and interested agents and
                        transported under Government control; that the Hawaiian Government claims
                        “the right to regulate measures taken for the re-population and industrial
                        development of the Kingdom,” and is not convinced that in so doing it has
                        violated any treaty stipulation with the United States.</p>
                    <p>I inclose a copy of this correspondence, together with the inclosures
                        referred to therein—or, rather, such inclosures as may not already be in
                        your possession.</p>
                    <p>As the Hawaiian Government has placed itself in an attitude where further
                        correspondence with me on the subject, under existing instructions, would be
                        profitless, the attitude of declining to admit that any of <pb n="268"
                            xml:id="pg_268" facs="0368"/>the provisions of the treaty of 1849 have
                        been violated, and claiming the right to make special contracts for the
                        transportation of Chinese laborers to these islands, I respectfully submit
                        the matter to you for further instruction.</p>

                            Mail Steamship Company, a corporation of one of the States of the United
                            States of America, has for some years past maintained a line of
                            steam-vessels between San Francisco and Australia, which, both on
                            outward and homeward trips, have regularly stopped at the Hawaiian
                            Islands for the delivery and reception of freights, passengers, and the
                            public mails; and has also maintained a line of steam vessels between
                            San Francisco and China, which have at intervals stopped at these
                            islands on their outward and homeward voyages. The Occidental and
                            Oriental Steamship Company, a corporation organized under the laws of
                            Great Britain, has likewise maintained a line of steam-vessels between
                            China and San Francisco, which have also at intervals stopped at the
                            Hawaiian Islands on their outward and homeward voyages.</p>
                        <p>On the 13th day of last July, at a meeting of His Majesty’s cabinet, a
                            resolution was adopted rescinding a previous resolution on the subject,
                            and authorizing the admission into the Hawaiian Kingdom of Chinese
                            laborers to the limit of 600 in every three months. About that time a
                            verbal agreement was entered into by the Hawaiian Government and the
                            Honolulu agency of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company conferring upon
                            that company and the Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company the
                            exclusive privilege of transporting such Chinese laborers to these
                            islands. In confirmation of this agreement I respectfully refer to your
                            excellency’s letter of instruction to His Majesty’s consul-general at
                            Hong-Kong under date of July 14, 1883, and to your letter of August 18,
                            1883, to the Honolulu agents of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, in
                            which the agreement is recognized and the assurance given “that unless
                            some emergency at present entirely unforeseen should arise, no change
                            will be made in the arrangements referred to without reasonable warning
                            being given to you,” and that “the permission just granted is likely to
                            remain in force for some time to come if the immigration taking place
                            under it be conducted in the manner and with the discretion which the
                            Government has reason to expect.” This agreement was made with and
                            confirmed to the Pacific Mail and Occidental and Oriental Steamship
                            Companies for the reasons (expressed in your letters to His Majesty’s
                            minister at Washington and His Majesty’s consul-general at Hong-Kong
                            under dates of July 14, 1883) that these companies had “the only
                            established lines of steamers at present in the trade,” and that their
                            “steamers are always well equipped and provided, and kept in a cleanly
                            condition, and carry experienced physicians.”</p>
                        <p>This privilege is regarded as of great consequence by the Pacific Mail
                            Steamship Company, as it would probably enable it to continue, even
                            through the dull season, the regular trips of its vessels bearing the
                            United States mails. But soon after it was granted, and after His
                            Majesty’s consul-general at Hong-Kong had been instructed to give
                            permission only to the vessels of the Pacific Mail and Occidental and
                            Oriental Steamship Companies to convey Chinese laborers to the Hawaiian
                            Islands, the privilege was, without notice and without apparent cause,
                            taken from these companies and given to the Oceanic Steamship Company,
                            embracing a line of two steamers plying between San Francisco and
                            Honolulu, and controlled by Mr. C. Spreckels, of San Francisco. The
                            notice of this change was given to the Honolulu agents of the Pacific
                            Mail Steamship Company on the 15th day of last October, in a
                            communication from your excellency informing them that His Majesty’s
                            consul-general at Hong Kong would “be instructed to issue permits for
                            the transportation of Chinese immigrants to this Kingdom, after 1st of
                            January next, only to vessels of the Oceanic Steamship Company.”</p>
                        <p>Through its attorney, Mr. Lauterbach, the Pacific Mail Steamship Company
                            makes representation that, previous to the transfer of the privilege
                            mentioned to the Oceanic Steamship Company, Mr. Spreckels informed the
                            Pacific Mail Steamship Company that unless its steamers to and from
                            Australia ceased to touch at the Hawaiian Islands he <pb n="269"
                                xml:id="pg_269" facs="0369"/>would procure the annulment of the
                            privilege to the Pacific Mail and Occidental and Oriental Steamship
                            Companies; that after having secured the privilege for the Oceanic
                            Steamship Company, Mr. Spreckels offered to transfer it to the Pacific
                            Mail Steamship Company, in consideration of the withdrawal of its San
                            Francisco and Australian steamers from the Hawaiian trade; and when this
                            offer was declined—owning or controlling no steamers by which he could
                            fulfill his contract with the Hawaiian Government for the transportation
                            of Chinese to these islands—he proffered to transfer it to the
                            Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company, a corporation organized under
                            the laws of Great Britain; and which proffer, although it has not been
                            accepted, is still under consideration.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances, it is assumed by the Pacific Mail Steamship
                            Company that the provisions of treaty obligations between Hawaii and the
                            United States have been contravened, and relief is asked by that
                            corporation.</p>
                        <p>The practical effect of the proposed exclusive grant or concession by the
                            Hawaiian Government to the Oceanic Steamship Company and the transfer of
                            the franchise to the Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company would be
                            to establish and maintain a discrimination against the Pacific Mail
                            Steamship Company in regard to an important and profitable element of
                            its carrying trade, and this, it is conceived by my Government, would be
                            in contravention of the first and second articles of the treaty of
                            December, 1849, between the United States and the Hawaiian Islands, and
                            directly at variance with the letter and spirit of the sixth article of
                            that treaty, the provisions of which are as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Steam-vessels of the United States which may be employed by the
                            Government of said States in the carrying of their public mails across
                            the Pacific Ocean, or from one port in that ocean to another, shall have
                            free access to the ports of the Sandwich Islands, with the privilege of
                            stopping therein to refit, to refresh, to land passengers and their
                            baggage, and for the transaction of any business pertaining to the
                            public mail service of the United States, and shall be subject in such
                            ports to no duties of tonnage, harbor, light-houses, quarantine, or
                            other similar duties of whatever nature or under whatever
                            denomination.”</p>
                        <p>It is true that the Oceanic Steamship Company is an American corporation;
                            but the transfer of its exclusive grant to an English company, and the
                            instruction of the Hawaiian Government to its consul-general at
                            Hong-Kong to grant permits to Chinese laborers to take passage alone on
                            the vessels of the line enjoying the exclusive privilege of receiving
                            them, accomplishes by indirection precisely what the treaty forbids
                            being done directly, that is, the establishing of a discriminating
                            policy in navigation and commerce against steam-vessels of the United
                            States plying between the eastern and western shores of the Pacific
                            Ocean and carrying its mails.</p>
                        <p>The right of the Hawaiian Government to admit to or exclude from its
                            dominions immigrants of any nationality or race is not for a moment
                            questioned by this; but that the exclusive privilege of carrying
                            immigrants who are admitted to Hawaii should be accorded to any one
                            company owning a particular line of vessels, whether American, Hawaiian,
                            or foreign to both countries, is believed to be unjust, and, as already
                            observed, inconsistent with the due maintenance of the treaty of
                            1849.</p>
                        <p>The Pacific Mail Steamship Company has no right to demand an exclusive
                            privilege in such carrying trade, but it may, with manifest propriety,
                            under the treaty, insist that no discriminating measures against its
                            vessels shall be maintained or permitted by the Hawaiian Government.</p>
                        <p>In a spirit of the largest friendship, I am instructed to submit these
                            views to His Majesty’s Government not doubting that, in its enlightened
                            sense of justice, it will adopt such measures in the premises as may be
                            necessary to relieve American vessels and American interests of a
                            threatened discrimination against them.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            excellency’s dispatch of 7th instant, No. 242, in which you recite
                            certain services of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company in the Pacific
                            Ocean in connection with the commerce of this Kingdom, and state that it
                            is assumed by the company that the provisions of treaty obligations
                            between Hawaii and the United States have been contravened, and that
                            relief is asked by that corporation.</p>
                        <p>I cannot refrain, Mr. Minister, from expressing, on the part of His
                            Majesty’s Government, <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0370"/>their
                            feeling of surprise that the Pacific Mail Steamship Company should enter
                            a complaint against this Government and seek relief from the Government
                            of the United States, The company has always received the most generous
                            consideration from this Government, which has gone to the full limit of
                            the means at its command for the purpose of encouraging the company’s
                            enterprise in connection with these islands. Fifteen years ago, when the
                            company proposed to allow the steamers of their China line to touch at
                            this port, the Hawaiian Government, at the urgent request of the manager
                            of the company, built a new and expensive wharf, constructed especially
                            for their use, and therefore unsuitable for the other shipping which at
                            that time used the wharves of Honolulu. Subsequently the contract for
                            the mail line between Australia and San Francisco was taken up by this
                            company, and they applied for a subsidy from the Hawaiian Government, in
                            addition to the other valuble facilities and exemptions which were
                            freely accorded to them. This application met with a ready response, and
                            the Hawaiian Legislature has ever since made provisions for its
                            continuance. From the beginning of the year 1876 up to the present date
                            the company has received on this account $84,500. This I estimate to be
                            equivalent to an annual subsidy of 20 cents per head from the population
                            of these islands, or equal in proportion to what an annual payment of
                            $10,000,000 would be to the people of the United States.</p>
                        <p>In addition to this subsidy the Government has extended the Esplanade
                            wharf for their accommodation, placed extensive sheds upon it, and
                            erected large stone warehouses in connection with it. The wharf and
                            buildings are as entirely at the disposal of the company as if they were
                            their own property, and even, under the circumstances, more advantageous
                            to their interest than if owned by them.</p>
                        <p>In remission of wharfage, of custom-house charges, warehouse rent,
                            storage of coal, and water charges, the company has enjoyed a further
                            advantage equal to a subsidy of $35,600, besides which all cargo
                            arriving by their steamers has been exempt from the wharfage charge of
                            25 cents per ton; and even now the agents of the company, by letter
                            dated the 8th instant, have applied to this Government for an extension
                            of the accommodation for the company’s storage of coal on the Esplanade,
                            which has been granted entirely without charge, in accordance with the
                            liberal spirit that has ever characterized the action of His Majesty’s
                            Government towards this steamship company.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I think, Mr. Minister, that it may be reasonably assumed, in
                            view of this substantial assistance rendered by Hawaii to the Pacific
                            Mail Steamship Company, that the latter might have seen reason to regard
                            this country as enlightened and liberal in its action in the aid and
                            encouragement of steamship enterprises, and might have been expected to
                            submit their complaint directly to this Government for
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government altogether disclaim any purpose of creating or
                            permitting a discrimination against American vessels and American
                            interests. A correct review of the events out of which the present
                            complaint of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company has arisen will not
                            warrant such an inference. About four months ago (August 18) His
                            Majesty’s Government intimated to the agents of the Pacific Mail
                            Steamship Company in Honolulu (and the letter of this date is the only
                            authoritative assurance they ever had) that it would permit the carrying
                            of Chinese immigrants to these islands in the vessels of their company
                            (which are partly British vessels) and of the Oriental and Occidental
                            Company (which are altogether British), on account of their superior
                            character and sanitary management, as in contrast with a certain class
                            that had been transporting immigrants previously. But the Government did
                            not, and could not with propriety, enter into any agreement or contract
                            in respect to this Chinese immigration for any period of time, as it was
                            not an immigration promoted or regulated by the Government, and might
                            (as it had already been) be stopped at any time for considerations of
                            state. The object of thus indicating a preference for the time being was
                            to avoid the risks of the introduction of contagious diseases from
                            Chinese ports by other vessels, as had already happened. No definite
                            agreement was entered into. Some time after this temporary arrangement
                            had been made (subject to termination at any time on notice being
                            given), proposals were addressed to the Government by a new steamship
                            company, exclusively American in capital and in the construction of its
                            vessels, and which engaged to make Honolulu its headquarters and to be
                            in every respect a domestic Hawaiian line, which would afford the most
                            ample opportunity during a period of days for the landing or quarantine
                            control of passengers, and which would not, as in the case of the
                            Pacific Mail and Occidental and Oriental ships sailing from Chinese
                            ports, be too large to enter our harbor, and have to discharge
                            passengers hurriedly, perhaps in the night time, outside the harbor.
                            This new company, the Oceanic Steamship Company, requested to be
                            permitted to undertake the Chinese or other Asiatic immigrant passenger
                            traffic. In reply the Government has engaged that “in the event” of the
                            company placing proper vessels in service for the Chinese trade, to
                            afford them all the opportunity for the transportation of immigrant
                            passengers that may properly be within the discretion of the Government.
                                <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0371"/>Ample notice of this new
                            arrangement was given to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company.</p>
                        <p>The privilege, or rather opportunity, afforded by His Majesty’s
                            Government cannot have been of great consequence to the Pacific Mail
                            Steamship Company, since, after enjoying it for four months, they have
                            not availed themselves of the permission nor brought a single Chinese
                            immigrant directly from Hong-Kong to this Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The statement made by the attorney of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company
                            of an alleged transfer of a certain privilege or assumed franchise for
                            the transportation of immigrant passengers to this Kingdom, I beg to
                            say, is without the cognizance of His Majesty’s Government, and is not
                            warranted by any authorization of this Government. Such a statement
                            should form no part of the complaint of the company.</p>
                        <p>I make bold to submit, Mr. Minister, that there has been no contravention
                            of the sixth or any other article of the treaty with the United States.
                            Steam-vessels of the Republic, whether “employed by the Government of
                            the said States” or” not so employed (as is, I believe, the case with
                            the Pacific Mail Company’s boats, which touch at the ports of this
                            Kingdom), have had “free access to the ports of the Sandwich Islands,
                            with the privilege of stopping therein to refit, to refresh, to land
                            passengers and their baggage, and for the transaction of any business
                            pertaining to the public mail service of the United States,” and have
                            not been subject in such ports to any duties of tonnage, harbor,
                            light-houses, quarantine, or other similar duties; and have, moreover,
                            been favored by the remission of many charges imposed upon other
                            shipping, and have been liberally aided by grants of money that were
                            generous in consideration of the resources of this country; and whatever
                            discrimination has been contemplated was in accordance with the estimate
                            of His Majesty’s Government of what was proper to be considered in
                            connection with the immigration and sanitary measures of this
                            country.</p>
                        <p>I hasten, Mr. Minister, to welcome with cordial regard the assurances
                            that the instructions from your excellency’s Government in respect to a
                            question with this Government are inspired by a spirit of the “largest
                            friendship,” and I recognize that the dispatch of your excellency is the
                            evidence of a friendly solicitude towards Hawaii on the part of the
                            Government of the United States, and I beg to assure you that His
                            Majesty’s Government are ever guided in their public action by a sense
                            of obligation to a great and magnanimous neighboring state; and that it
                            can never enter into their policy to discriminate unfavorably against
                            American interests, or seek to contravene in the slightest degree the
                            treaty obligations so happily maintained between the Republic of the
                            United States and the Hawaiian Kingdom. I venture to believe that the
                            perusal of what I have now had the honor to lay before your excellency
                            will convince your Government that this assurance is not vain, and that
                            the complaint of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company is without
                            foundation.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your excellency’s communication of the 10th instant, in reply
                            to my letter of the 7th, relating to certain exclusive agreements
                            entered into by the Hawaiian Government for the transportation of
                            Chinese laborers to these islands.</p>
                        <p>You admit the essential facts upon which is based the complaint of the
                            Pacific Mail Steamship Company, but deny that any injustice has thereby
                            been suffered by that corporation, or that any treaty obligation with
                            the United States has been contravened by the Hawaiian Government,
                            either in granting to the Pacific Mail and Occidental and Oriental
                            Steamship Companies the exclusive right to transport Chinese laborers to
                            the Hawaiian Islands, or in less than three months thereafter
                            transferring that privilege to the Oceanic Steamship Company, coupled
                            with an alleged disposition and purpose by the latter to re transfer the
                            franchise in its fullness to a line of exclusively English steamers.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency refers at some length to the many favors heretofore
                            granted to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company by the Hawaiian
                            Government, and assumes that gratitude should have closed its mouth of
                            complaint. I fail to observe the pertinence of this recital.</p>
                        <p>The attention of the Hawaiian Government is directed to the exclusive
                            agreement <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0372"/>under notice, not for
                            the benefit solely of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, but in the
                            interest of any and every American steamship or steamship company
                            capable of properly performing a service from the equal advantages of
                            which they would be unjustly debarred by special concessions. Hence, the
                            favors accorded the Pacific Mail Steamship Company by the Hawaiian
                            Government cannot be considered in connection with the broad question
                            involved, nor can the implied ingratitude of that corporation be avenged
                            upon American commerce or be made the pretext for a violation of treaty
                            obligations.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency assumes that “the privilege, or rather opportunity,
                            afforded by His Majesty’s Government cannot have been of great
                            consequence to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, since, after enjoying
                            it for four months, they have not availed themselves of the permission
                            nor brought a single Chinese immigrant directly from Hong-Kong to this
                            Kingdom.” Although but of small consequence, this assumption, I am
                            persuaded, will be found less tenable if your excellency will consider
                            it in connection with a somewhat more concise statement of the facts,
                            namely, that your letter to His Majesty’s consul-general at Hong-Kong,
                            under date of July 14, 1883, giving effect to the agreement with the
                            Pacific Mail Steamship Company, could scarcely have reached that officer
                            before the middle of August, while your note to the Honolulu agents of
                            that company giving notice of a discontinuance of the privilege was
                            dated October 15, 1883.</p>
                        <p>But, however the annulment of this agreement may have affected the
                            Pacific Mail Steamship Company, your excellency seems to find
                            justification for it in the alleged advantage which would accrue to the
                            Hawaiian Government in the transfer of the service to a line of steamers
                            capable of entering the harbor of Honolulu, and which would “be in every
                            respect a domestic Hawaiian line.” Considering that the contract was
                            transferred to a company without steamers to perform the service, and
                            without specific agreement as to the character of the vessels to be
                            constructed or chartered to perform it, and that one of the first acts
                            of that company after securing the contract was to offer it for a
                            consideration to an established line of steamers, the assumed advantages
                            to the Hawaiian Government of the transfer of the agreement can scarcely
                            be regarded as sufficiently substantial to sustain either the breach of
                            a private contract or the violation of a public treaty.</p>
                        <p>The position assumed by your excellency that neither the sixth nor any
                            other article of the treaty of 1849 has been contravened by the Hawaiian
                            Government in entering into and seeking to give force to these exclusive
                            agreements, the last of which involves its probable transfer to a line
                            of English steamers, does not seem to be in harmony with the second
                            article of that treaty, which provides that “the subjects or citizens of
                            any other state shall not enjoy any favor, privilege, or immunity
                            whatever in matters of commerce and navigation which shall not also at
                            the same time be extended to the subjects or citizens of the other
                            contracting party.” Can these stipulations be faithfully observed by the
                            Hawaiian Government in making exclusive contracts with particular lines
                            of vessels for the transportation to these islands of Chinese
                            immigrants—in making exclusive contracts which their holders consider
                            legitimate subjects of barter? It is not enough that a transfer of the
                            contract of the Oceanic Steamship Company to a line of English steamers
                            “is not warranted by any authorization “of the Hawaiian Government. The
                            emergency of the situation would be more completely met by the
                            information that no such transfer would be permitted.</p>
                        <p>But, in dwelling somewhat upon matters of specific complaint, I fear that
                            I have failed to make clear, as was the purpose in my first
                            communication to you on the subject, the views of my Government in
                            relation to these discriminating contracts or agreements. Permit me now
                            to say, without reference to any alleged breach of contract, that it is
                            not asked that the Pacific Mail and Occidental and Oriental Steamship
                            Companies be restored in their agreement with the Hawaiian Government,
                            since it was entered into in derogation of treaty rights affecting
                            American interests. Nor is the contract with the Oceanic Steamship
                            Company any the less repugnant to treaty obligations existing between
                            the United States and the Hawaiian Government.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">gravamen</hi> of the matter at issue is not that
                            the contract was taken, either with or without cause, from one company
                            or two companies and given to another, but that such an agreement was
                            made at all. Nor would an exclusive contract with a Hawaiian company be
                            admissible, since the according of an exclusive and discriminating
                            privilege in the premises to any one company owning a particular line of
                            ships, whether American, Hawaiian, or foreign to both countries, is
                            believed to be unjust, and, I am instructed to say, inconsistent with
                            the due maintenance of the treaty of 1849.</p>
                        <p>It will gratify me to learn that these views accord so closely with those
                            of His Majesty’s Government that it will feel it an act of justice, as
                            well as friendship, to the people of the United States to set aside as
                            unauthorized any discriminating agreement now existing for the exclusive
                            transportation of Chinese immigrants to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your excellency’s dispatch of 13th instant, replying to mine
                            of the 10th, and restating the views of your Government that the
                            arrangement existing between His Majesty’s Government and the Pacific
                            Mail Steamship Company, and that which it is contemplated to make with
                            the Oceanic Steamship Company, for the purpose of the regulation of
                            immigration of Chinese laborers into this Kingdom, is repugnant to
                            treaty obligations existing between the United States and this
                            country.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency refers to the arrangement with the Pacific Mail Steamship
                            Company, which was a permission revokable at will, as one of binding
                            obligation, and speaks of the recall of a temporary permission, after
                            giving due notice, as a “breach of contract.” This arrangement or
                            permission, which is contained in a letter of which I annex a copy (the
                            only authoritative assurance on the subject given to the Pacific Mail
                            Steamship Company), will not, I feel assured, bear such a construction;
                            and I respectfully submit to your excellency that in this matter there
                            has been no agreement or mutual obligation entered into between two
                            contracting parties, and consequently no breach of contract. If the
                            phrase “breach of contract” were admissible in connection with this
                            matter, it would have to be read the other way, since the Pacific Mail
                            Steamship Company, after making frequent application to His Majesty’s
                            Government for leave to bring Chinese laborers into the Kingdom, and
                            promising to do so, have failed to bring any, notwithstanding permission
                            to do so of long standing.</p>
                        <p>There is one point to which your excellency recurs on several occasions,
                            which I think should have no place in the discussion, and that is an
                            alleged probable transfer to a line of English steamers of privileges
                            which are said to be conceded by His Majesty’s Government to the Oceanic
                            Steamship Company. I append herewith copy of the letter to the Oceanic
                            Steamship Company which is the sole warrant or authority for a supposed
                            transferable contract, agreement, or concession from the Government to
                            the company, and I think your excellency will agree with me that the
                            permission assured in this letter is in no sense a negotiable
                            “franchise.” Now, insomuch as the Pacific Mail Steamship Company hold at
                            this time a privilege exactly similar to that which has, under
                            conditions, been promised to the Oceanic Steamship Company, no one
                            should know better than the managers of the former company that the
                            privilege they hold is not of a nature to be transferred. A complaint,
                            therefore, from them about an alleged disposition or purpose on the part
                            of the Oceanic Steamship Company to transfer or barter away an identical
                            privilege or permission, is not a complaint against this Government, and
                            should have no place in the discussion of the international question
                            which your excellency brings forward.</p>
                        <p>In general reply upon the gra<hi rend="italic">v</hi>amen of the question
                            as presented by your excellency, I have the honor to say that His
                            Majesty’s Government recognize that the regulation of immigration,
                            especially of the immigration of Chinese male laborers, into this
                            Kingdom, is a measure of vital national importance, and that such
                            regulation is not repugnant to any treaty obligation, and this I am
                            satisfactorily assured by your excellency is the view of the Government
                            of the United States. Now, the method which has been selected for the
                            exercise of this right cannot be called in question unless it can be
                            clearly shown that it contravenes the actual covenants of a treaty. It
                            is entirely in connection with immigration that the discrimination
                            complained of has been made, and for the purpose of controlling the
                            sanitary conditions of such immigrations.</p>
                        <p>The circumstances that must regulate immigration in the case of Hawaii
                            are extremely different from those which obtain in the United States,
                            where vast territories still wait to be peopled. It is necessary very
                            closely to control the immigration to this country, both as to its
                            character and its numbers, and this is more especially the case in
                            regard to the influx of Chinese. For a while an immigration of Chinese,
                            composed almost exclusively of men, assumed the character of an
                            invasion, and His Majesty’s Government found it necessary to put a stop
                            to it peremptorily. Subsequently evidence was submitted that the Chinese
                            laborers whose engagements on our plantations had expired were returning
                            to their own country at the rate of about two thousand annually, and His
                            Majesty’s Government then decided to permit a limited and regulated
                            immigration of about six hundred Chinese laborers every three months,
                            calculated to replace those that were leaving. In the exercise of their
                            right His Majesty’s Government selected the persons who should be
                            allowed to manage this immigration of Chinese laborers, as it has done
                            in the case of the immigration of laborers and settlers of other
                            nationalities.</p>
                        <p>The Government has not for several years past deemed it wise to create
                            establishments of its own in other countries for the selection of
                            immigrants, but has from time <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0374"
                            />to time empowered responsible persons to make suitable selection, and
                            to provide for the transportation of immigrant passengers to these
                            islands, under engagements or otherwise, as the case might be, and with
                            free passages or otherwise. In this manner large numbers of people have
                            been brought here from the Portuguese dominions, from Germany, Norway,
                            and the islands of the Western Pacific.</p>
                        <p>Circumstances to which I have already alluded have shown the imperative
                            necessity for placing the immigration of Chinese upon the same footing.
                            The arrangements that have been made to secure this end are entirely
                            similar in their character to those by which other immigration has been
                            conducted. In selecting influential corporations like the Pacific Mail
                            Steamship Company and the Oceanic Steamship Company to conduct this
                            immigration, His Majesty’s Government have been actuated by the same
                            motives as guided them in the choice of agents who have managed other
                            immigrations, viz, the desire to deal with responsible persons who have
                            too much at stake to misconduct the work intrusted to them, and who will
                            comply with the wishes of this Government in all such matters as the
                            numbers to be brought, the arrangements to be made with the immigrants,
                            and the sanitary precautions to be taken on the voyage and on
                            arrival.</p>
                        <p>I respectfully submit to your excellency that such arrangements made for
                            the regulation and control of immigration are entirely within the rights
                            of this Government. It is no favor, privilege, or immunity in connection
                            with the ordinary course of commerce and navigation, but an arrangement
                            made by the Government for the conduct and management of affairs which
                            belong exclusively to the domestic interests of the Kingdom. I cannot
                            understand how such discrimination in the carrying out of a national
                            measure of vital importance can be regarded as a violation of treaty
                            obligation. If such were the case, a certain discrimination, heretofore
                            deemed properly warranted, such as the payment of subsidies to steam
                            vessels belonging to United States citizens which trade to our ports,
                            and compete with the sailing vessels, equally the property of Americans,
                            which receive no subsidy, must be regarded as in contravention of treaty
                            obligations; and, pursuing the inference to its just conclusion, so
                            might any contract made by this Government for the transport of cargo
                            the property of the Government be regarded as a discrimination not
                            warranted by treaty.</p>
                        <p>I beg to say in conclusion that His Majesty’s Government have not made a
                            contract or granted a franchise in connection with Chinese immigration
                            capable of being subject to transfer or barter; that they claim the
                            right to regulate measures taken for the repopulation and industrial
                            development of the Kingdom; and I respectfully submit that the views on
                            the question presented by your excellency, and in which you invite His
                            Majesty’s Government to coincide, have been entertained and brought
                            forward under a misconception of the nature of the arrangements entered
                            into and of the circumstances which have guided the action of the
                            Government. I hasten, however, to give the assurance to your excellency
                            that His Majesty’s Government, recognizing the fairness and impartiality
                            of the Government of the United States in the treatment of international
                            questions, is anxious to meet the views of your Government, and will, on
                            being convinced that its action even implies the infraction of any
                            article of a treaty with the United States, at once take such steps as
                            wall obviate the fact or the implication.</p>

                            Steamship Company, desire to call your excellency’s attention to the
                            subject of transportation of Chinese passengers from Hong-Kong and other
                            Asiatic ports to Honolulu under Government permission and
                            regulation.</p>
                        <p>The company are about to place on the route between the ports of this
                            Kingdom and those of Japan and other Asiatic states a line of first
                            class-vessels, fully equal, if not superior, to the Mariposa and
                            Alameda, vessels of their line now plying between the ports of San
                            Francisco and Honolulu. These new vessels will be fitted up in the best
                            manner for the safe and comfortable transportation of immigrant
                            passengers, and will be placed under regulation calculated to insure the

                            therefore, we ask of the Government, in the exercise of its discretion
                            in the control of immigrant Chinese passenger transportation, that it
                            will extend to our company such opportunity for the transportation of
                            Chinese and other Asiatic immigrants as may be within the discretion of
                            the Government, and such as may appear justly warranted by the

                            letter of the 8th instant, in which, on behalf of the Oceanic Steamship
                            Company, you propose to establish a new line of steamships, equal, if
                            not superior, to the Mariposa and Alameda, to run between the ports of
                            Honolulu and Hong-Kong and other Asiatic ports, stating that said line
                            of vessels will be “virtually a domestic Hawaiian line,” and you ask of
                            the Government to “extend to the company such opportunity for the
                            transportation of Chinese and other Asiatic immigrants of this Kingdom
                            as may appear justly warranted by the superiority of the accommodations
                            and conditions which the company offers.”</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to say in reply, by authorization of His Majesty in
                            cabinet council, that in the event of the Oceanic Steamship Company
                            placing in service, for the accommodation of Chinese and other Asiatic
                            immigrant passengers to this Kingdom, a superior new line of vessels
                            which will be virtually a domestic Hawaiian line, that His Majesty’s
                            Government will extend to your company all the opportunity for the
                            transportation of such immigrant passengers as may be within the
                            discretion of the Government, and such as will be justly warranted by
                            the superiority of the accommodations and conditions which your company
                            offers.</p>

                            confirm at once to the company, on the arrival of the pioneer of such

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In relation to the Hawaiian coinage and bond
                        question, to which reference was made in my dispatches Nos. 106 and 110, I
                        have the honor to inform you that a full bench of the supreme court has
                        decided that a mandamus was not a proper writ to restrain the minister of
                        finance from exchanging Hawaiian 6 per cent, bonds for Hawaiian silver
                        currency. Thereupon, to the same end, an injunction was applied for; but it
                        was denied, for the reason that the minister of finance, in his answer,
                        disclaimed any intention to issue the bonds for the consideration objected
                        to by the petitioners. The position of the petitioners has been
                        substantially sustained, however, in the assumption by the court that the
                        face value of the new Hawaiian silver coins does not represent the “par
                        value,” for which the bonds can alone be exchanged. In the mean time an
                        additional $180,000 in Hawaiian subsidiary silver coins arrived here on the
                        8th instant, making $300,000 in all. Mr. Claus Spreckels also arrived from
                        San Francisco at the same time. Reasonably, Mr. Spreckels is by no means
                        disconcerted at the judgment of the supreme court. As the privy council has
                        given to the coinage a legal-tender value, he can use the million dollars he
                        is authorized to coin more advantageously in the payment of plantation
                        expenditure than in exchanging the coin for Hawaiian bonds, especially since
                        the large seigniorage of the coinage accrues to Mr. Spreckels alone.</p>
                    <p>Should the Government find itself unable to purchase these coins, they may
                        readily be put in circulation by a branch of the Anglo-Cali-fornia Bank of
                        San Francisco which is about to be established hereunder the firm-name of
                        Spreckels &amp; Co.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my instruction No. 38, of the
                        15th of November last, in relation to the exclusive privileges recently
                        granted by the Government of Hawaii to the Oceanic Steamship Company, an
                        American line, with regard to carrying and landing of Chinese immigrants, I
                        have now to acknowledge the receipt of your dispatch No. 108, of the 21st of
                        December, on that subject.</p>
                    <p>In my No. 38, just referred to, you were directed to present the subject to
                        His Hawaiian Majesty’s Government in the most friendly spirit, believing as
                        the President then did, and still believes, that the mere suggestion of the
                        matter would at once commend to the justice and friendly feeling of His
                        Hawaiian Majesty toward this Government the propriety of such measures as
                        might be found necessary, remedial, and precautious in regard to the unjust
                        discrimination complained of.</p>
                    <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0377"/>
                    <p>I have read with careful attention the correspondence on the subject between
                        Mr. Gibson, the Hawaiian minister for foreign affairs, and yourself, and, as
                        it appears to this Government, the real question in the case has been
                        misconceived by Mr. Gibson. That question is not the grievance or complaint
                        of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company or of any other American line of
                        steamships, nor the relative rights of such lines, although these questions
                        may be incidentally involved. It is an international question between the
                        two Governments, involving the true construction or interpretation of the
                        sixth article of the treaty of the 20th of December, 1849. For the sake of
                        precision I again quote that article, which reads: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Steam-vessels of the United States which may be employed by the
                                Government of the said States in the carrying of their public mails
                                across the Pacific Ocean, or from one port in that ocean to another,
                                shall have free access to the ports of the Sandwich Islands, with
                                the privilege of stopping therein to refit, to refresh, to land
                                passengers and their baggage, and for the transaction of any
                                business pertaining to the public mail service of the United States,
                                and shall be subject in such ports to no duties of tonnage, harbor,
                                light-houses, quarantine, or other similar duties, of whatever
                                nature or under whatever denomination.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>Nothing can be clearer or plainer than the wording of this article. Steam
                        vessels of the United States means all steam vessels of the United States,
                        with the single qualification that they shall be employed in carrying the
                        mails of the United States, all such vessels, no matter of what line, are
                        equally entitled in the ports of Hawaii to all the privileges stipulated for
                        and secured by the terms of that article. If the immigration of the subjects
                        of China into Hawaii is prohibited by the laws of the latter Kingdom, as
                        Hawaii has, of course, a perfect and complete sovereign right to do, then
                        all American steamships, of whatever line, are bound to respect such
                        prohibitory law. If, on the other hand, Chinese immigrants are permitted to
                        come to Hawaii, either indiscriminately or in limited numbers, or under any
                        other conditions that may be imposed by the laws or regulations of that
                        Kingdom, then such immigrants are passengers within the meaning of the
                        article of the treaty which I have quoted, and all American steamships
                        carrying the mail possess an undoubted right, under the stipulations of the
                        treaty, to take them as passengers and to land them in any of the ports of
                        Hawaii in accordance with such stipulations. To say that Hawaiian vessels
                        shall alone have the right to carry such passengers would be a
                        discrimination against American vessels; to say that the ships of a nation
                        foreign to both the United States and Hawaii shall enjoy such exclusive
                        right would be equally a discrimination against American steamers; and to
                        say that one particular line shall possess such exclusive carrying
                        privilege, to the exclusion of all other American lines or steam vessels of
                        this country, would be no less a discrimination against American steam
                        vessels, and would be held by this Government to be a violation of the plain
                        letter of the sixth article of the treaty of 1849. Such an interpretation of
                        the treaty as would permit any of these discriminations to be put in force
                        and practice by the Government of Hawaii is one that this Government could
                        not for a moment assent to, and yet that is the interpretation which, by
                        fair and irresistible inference, the argument of Mr. Gibson seems to demand
                        for it.</p>
                    <p>This Government seeks no exclusive privilege for the Pacific Mail Steamship
                        Company. On the contrary, it would be equally as ready to denounce any such
                        exclusive privilege granted to that line at any time in the future as it is
                        now to denounce the unjust discrimination in favor <pb n="278"
                            xml:id="pg_278" facs="0378"/>of the Oceanic, which is also an American
                        line. What it does demand is that all American steamships, of whatever line,
                        shall, with respect to the carrying trade and within the limitations of the
                        sixth article of the treaty of 1849 between the two Governments, be placed
                        on a basis of impartial equality with each other, with the vessels of the
                        most favored nation, and with the vessels of the Hawaiian Kingdom. This is
                        the only interpretation of the treaty that seems just to the President, and
                        the only one he is prepared to assent to. Neither the question of sanitary
                        measures nor the rights of any particular line of American steamships are
                        involved, and in your future correspondence with the minister for foreign
                        affairs of Hawaii you will carefully avoid and respectfully decline any
                        discussion on these two latter points. The sole question in the present
                        contention is that the exclusive privilege now already or about to be
                        granted to the Oceanic Line is conceived by this Government to be an unjust
                        discrimination against all other American steamships carrying the mails
                        between the eastern and western shores of the Pacific Ocean; that it is in
                        contravention of the letter and spirit of the article of the treaty referred
                        to; and the President hopes, as he believes, that the Government of Hawaii,
                        noted no less for its high intelligence than for its sense of justice, will
                        speedily adopt the proper measures to rescind the privilege, if granted, and

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: As the legal-tender value of Hawaiian as well
                        as American silver coinage is limited in the Hawaiian Islands, and as Mr.
                        Spreckels, under his contract with the Government, has already put in
                        circulation here $300,000 in half and quarter dollars of Hawaiian mintage,
                        with the probability of adding $700,000 more, partly in silver dollars and
                        partly in subsidiary coinage, the Honolulu Chamber of Commerce has addressed
                        a communication to his excellency the minister of finance, asserting that a
                        greater excess of silver would operate as an embarrassment to business, and
                        asking, in substance, that no further introduction of Hawaiian silver be
                        allowed without a proportionate withdrawal of other silver coins. (Silver
                        coins are legal tender to the extent of 50 per cent, on a hundred dollars,
                        25 per cent, between a hundred and a thousand dollars, and 15 per cent, on
                        all sums in excess of $1,000.) A committee from the Chamber of Commerce also
                        waited upon the ministry in the same behalf, and received an assurance from
                        the minister of foreign affairs that the matter would be accorded the
                        careful consideration of the cabinet.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that the
                        Hawaiian minister of foreign affairs has at length been enabled to make such
                        changes and concessions in relation to the granting of special contracts for
                        the transportation of Chinese laborers to these islands as will harmonize
                        substantially with the interpretation of the treaty of 1849 which I was
                        instructed to present to His Majesty’s Government.</p>
                    <p>Following the receipt of your dispatch of February 2, 1884 (No. 47), I
                        resumed my correspondence on the subject with His Majesty’s minister of
                        foreign affairs, and, with an emphasis warranted by more definite
                        instructions, again advised his excellency of your interpretation of Article
                        VI of the treaty of 1849, and asked His Majesty’s Government to take such
                        measures as might be necessary to relieve American steamships carrying the
                        United States mails of the discrimination against them involved in the
                        continuance of existing or the making of future contracts according to
                        particular lines of steamships the exclusive privilege of bringing Chinese
                        laborers or passengers to the Hawaiian Islands. A copy of this letter,
                        bearing date of March 5, 1884, I have the honor to inclose herewith.</p>
                    <p>On the 13th instant I was favored with a reply from the minister of foreign
                        affairs, a copy of which I also inclose. His excellency conveys the
                        information that no steamship company holds or has lately held any
                        authorization to transport Chinese laborers to the Hawaiian Islands. This
                        will occasion no surprise when it is remembered that the contract with the
                        Pacific Mail Steamship Company, by previous notification of the Hawaiian
                        Government, ceased on the 1st of January last, and that the Oceanic
                        Steamship Company, or Mr. Spreckels, to whom the privilege was to have been
                        transferred, is still without steamers to perform the service.</p>
                    <p>Without fully abandoning its position respecting its right, under its treaty
                        covenants with the United States, to make exclusive contracts for the
                        transportation to these islands of limited numbers and specified classes of
                        Chinese immigrants, the Hawaiian Government has met the emergency with an
                        order, followed with corresponding instructions to its representatives
                        abroad, to the effect that Chinese immigrants in excess of twenty-five in
                        any one vessel will not be admitted hereafter into the Hawaiian Kingdom, and
                        his excellency gives assurance that, pending the consideration of the
                        subject of Chinese immigration by the next Legislative Assembly, “no permits
                        are or will be issued to any steamer lines giving them any exclusive
                        privilege in regard to the transportation of Chinese immigrant laborers from
                        Hong-Kong or elsewhere to this Kingdom.”</p>
                    <p>As the enforcement of these regulations in good faith will put an end to
                        Chinese immigration, as well as to the discrimination complained of in
                        connection with it, I shall be pleased to be confirmed in the judgment that
                        a further discussion of the subject at this time is unnecessary.</p>
                    <p>Very respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your letter of the 19th of
                            December last, relating to the granting by the Hawaiian Government of
                            special and exclusive privileges to the Oceanic Steamship Company in the
                            transportation of Chinese laborers to these islands, I have the honor to
                            advise your excellency that I am now possessed of the specific
                            conclusions of my Government on the subject, with a full consideration
                            of the correspondence in connection therewith between your excellency
                            and this legation.</p>
                        <p>Without reviewing the entire ground covered by the controversy, I beg
                            respectfully to say that the right claimed by your excellency for
                            Hawaii, under its treaty relations with the United States, to grant
                            exclusive privileges for the transportation of Chinese passengers to
                            these islands, either for sanitary or other reasons, cannot be admitted
                            by my Government. As has already been brought to your excellency’s
                            attention, the real question involved is not the grievance of the
                            Pacific Mail Steamship Company or of any other American line of
                            steamships, nor the relative rights of such lines, however they may be
                            incidentally affected.</p>
                        <p>It is strictly an international question between the two Governments,
                            involving the construction or interpretation of Article VI of the treaty
                            of 1849, which guarantees to “steam-vessels of the United States
                            “carrying its mails the right to freely enter Hawaiian ports and “land
                            passengers and their baggage.” All steam-vessels of the United States
                            carrying its mails are entitled to this privilege, without regard to the
                            lines to which they may belong.</p>
                        <p>The sovereign right of Hawaii to prohibit the immigration of Chinese to
                            its shores is not questioned, and American steamships, of whatever line,
                            would be bound to respect such prohibition; but if Chinese immigrants
                            are permitted to come to Hawaii, either indiscriminately or in limited
                            numbers, or under any other condition that may be imposed by the laws or
                            regulations of the Kingdom, then such immigrants are passengers within
                            the meaning of Article VI of the treaty of 1849, and all American
                            steamships carrying the mails possess an undoubted right to take and
                            land them as passengers in any of the ports of Hawaii, in accordance
                            with treaty stipulation.</p>
                        <p>To accord an exclusive right to carry such passengers either to Hawaiian
                            vessels, to vessels of a nation foreign to both the United States and
                            Hawaii, or to vessels of any particular line, whether American,
                            Hawaiian, or foreign, would be equally a discrimination against American
                            steam-vessels, and would be held by my Government to be a violation of
                            the plain letter of Article VI of the treaty of 1849; and neither would
                            my judgment counsel nor my instructions permit me to assent to an
                            interpretation giving warrant to any such discrimination.</p>
                        <p>I beg again to assure your excellency that no exclusive privilege is
                            claimed for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. On the contrary, the
                            granting of such a privilege to that or any other line would be quite as
                            objectionable as the discrimination now sought to be made in favor of
                            the Oceanic Steamship Company.</p>
                        <p>What is asked is that all American steamships, of whatever line, shall,
                            with respect to the carrying trade and within the limitations of treaty
                            provisions, be placed on an equality with each other, with the vessels
                            of the most favored nation, and with the vessels of the Hawaiian
                            Kingdom. This is the only interpretation of the treaty which seems to be
                            just; the only interpretation which my Government is prepared to assent
                            to; and in connection with it the question of sanitary measures or the
                            rights of any particular line of steamships cannot be considered. The
                            treaty must be interpreted in harmony with its spirit and its language,
                            and so long as its provisions are held to be binding the observance of
                            its covenants cannot justly or in good faith be contravened or modified
                            by either party to meet a sanitary or other emergency.</p>
                        <p>To state the point directly, the exclusive privilege already or about to
                            be granted to the Oceanic Steamship Company is conceived by my
                            Government to be an unjust discrimination against all other American
                            steamships carrying the mails between the eastern and western shores of
                            the Pacific Ocean; that it is in contravention of the provisions of the
                            treaty of 1849; and the President hopes, as he believes, that the
                            Hawaiian Government, noted no less for its high intelligence than for
                            its sense of justice, will speedily adopt the proper measures to rescind
                            the privilege, if granted, and if not granted, to prevent its
                            fulfillment.</p>

                            of December 19, conveying to me the specific conclusions of the

                            connected with the transport of Chinese laborers to these islands, to
                            the effect that the right claimed by this Government to grant such
                            exclusive privileges, either for sanitary or other reasons, involves a
                            violation of treaty stipulations.</p>
                        <p>In my dispatch of January 4, which was accompanied by a copy of a letter
                            to His Majesty’s consul-general at Hong Kong, I had the honor to inform
                            your excellency that ho instruction had been sent to authorize any line
                            of steamers, to transport Chinese immigrant laborers to these islands,
                            and at the present time no such authorization exists. Any attempt on the
                            part of any line of steamers to introduce such immigrant laborers is
                            wholly without the warrant of permission or instruction from His

                            of the United States that the sovereign right of His Majesty’s
                            Government to restrict or inhibit Chinese immigration remains
                            unquestioned.</p>
                        <p>This immigration cannot be regarded in the same light as ordinary
                            passenger travel such as was contemplated when the treaty of 1849 was
                            negotiated.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government would not think, even without treaty
                            obligations, of imposing restrictions on ordinary passenger traffic to
                            this Kingdom; but a passenger traffic composed exclusively of male
                            laborers, entirely without means, who show no disposition for settlement
                            or assimilation abroad, is of such a character that the great American
                            Republic itself has found it expedient, as Hawaii now does, to have a
                            complete control of such traffic or immigration. Without such control
                            there would in the case of this country be danger to its autonomy.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, His Majesty’s Government, confirming a resolution of His
                            Majesty in cabinet council of July 13, of last year, have placed in the
                            control of this Department the regulation of Chinese immigration, and I
                            have the honor to inform your excellency that an order has been issued
                            and communicated to His Majesty’s diplomatic and consular
                            representatives at Washington, San Francisco, and elsewhere, that
                            Chinese coming here (not already furnished with official permits) in
                            numbers exceeding twenty-five in any one vessel will not be allowed
                            entrance into this Kingdom. Meantime the whole subject of Chinese
                            immigration will be submitted to the Legislative Assembly at its
                            approaching session with the view of obtaining new and decisive
                            legislation upon the subject. I have therefore the honor to inform your
                            excellency that in the mean time no permits are or will be issued to any
                            steamer lines giving to them any exclusive privileges in regard to the
                            transportation of Chinese immigrant laborers from Hong Kong or elsewhere
                            to this Kingdom.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my dispatch of the 15th instant (No. 132) I
                        referred to recent regulations of the Hawaiian Government limiting Chinese
                        immigration to twenty-five in any one vessel, a measure manifestly designed
                        to put an end to a further increase in the Chinese population of these
                        islands. I have the honor to inclose herewith a copy of these regulations,
                        as officially published.</p>
                    <p>On the 9th of April, 1883, the cabinet in council adopted a resolution
                        protesting against, and taking steps to prevent, a further influx of Chinese
                        male laborers to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
                    <p>At the solicitation of planters this resolution was rescinded on the 13th of
                        July, 1883, and another adopted in its stead, authorizing an <pb n="282"
                            xml:id="pg_282" facs="0382"/>immigration of Chinese laborers to the
                        limit of 600 in any three months. The latter resolution has now given place
                        to regulations restricting such immigration to 25 in any one vessel.</p>
                    <p>As this limit will not warrant the touching of San Francisco and Hong-Kong
                        steamers at Honolulu, very few Chinese immigrants may be looked for under
                        existing regulations. Under the 600 limit, however, more than 1,000 have
                        arrived during the past two weeks, and as many more are expected.</p>
                    <p>As these large shipments are plainly in excess of the prescribed limit, it is
                        not improbable that an attempt to land any considerable number more may be
                        resisted by the Government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my letter of 13th ultimo, dealing with
                            the subject of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company’s complaint, I had the
                            honor to inform your excellency that an order had been issued, and
                            communicated to His Majesty’s diplomatic and consular representatives at
                            Washington, San Francisco, and elsewhere, that Chinese passengers coming
                            here (not already furnished with official permits) in numbers exceeding
                            twenty-five in any one vessel will not be allowed entrance into the
                            Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>I now have the honor to transmit a copy of regulations for the admission
                            of Chinese immigrant laborers, embodying the provisions above alluded
                            to, which have been made and published under the authority of the
                            resolution of His Majesty in cabinet council referred to in my letter
                            already quoted.</p>
                        <p>In doing so I deem it right to address to you, as the representative of a
                            friendly power which always manifests a kindly interest in the welfare
                            of this Kingdom, a few remarks upon the circumstances which have led the
                            Government to issue these regulations.</p>
                        <p>In April of last year I had the honor to send you a copy of a resolution
                            of His Majesty in cabinet council, passed in consequence of the
                            extraordinary influx of Chinese men into the country, with the prospect
                            of an injurious increase.</p>
                        <p>The terms in which you expressed to me your satisfaction at the course
                            taken by the Government assure me that it is not necessary to enlarge
                            upon the undesirability of permitting large numbers of male Chinese to
                            be added to our small population, of which their countrymen already form
                            so large a part, and in which the disproportion of the sexes, chiefly
                            caused by importation of Chinese men, is so very great. The protest made
                            at that time by the Government had the effect of stopping the
                            immigration against which it was directed. At a later period of the
                            year, however, such representations were made by the employers of labor
                            here as led the Government to feel, that it would be well to allow small
                            numbers of Chinese laborers to be brought in from time to time to supply
                            the places of those who return to their native country. An exlusive
                            leave was then granted to the companies running regular lines of
                            steamers between China and San Francisco to bring in this limited number
                            of laborers. Subsequently another company proposed to establish a
                            Hawaiian line of steamers to ply between Honolulu and Asiatic ports, and
                            to encourage such an important domestic enterprise the Government
                            promised the privilege of carrying Chinese immigrant laborers to this
                            country to the new line in the event of its establishment. Notice was
                            then given (under date of October 15, 1883) to the agents of the Pacific
                            Mail Steamship Company and the Oriental and Occidental Steamship Company
                            that their permission to bring such passengers here would cease on the
                            1st of January of this year. The Pacific Mail Steamship Company,
                            regardless of the action of the Government and of the strong public
                            feeling which exists here on the subject, made arrangements to bring to
                            Honolulu between two and three thousand Chinese male laborers within the
                            space of a few weeks. Their example has apparently encouraged other
                            ship-owners to attempt the same course, since, according to the
                            information furnished to the Government, at least one other steamship
                            (not belonging to any established line) is on the way here with a full
                            complement of passengers of the same class.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances the Government deemed it desirable, pending the
                            meeting of the Legislative Assembly, to make and publish new regulations
                            for the control of this traffic, instead of reverting to the absolute
                            prohibition of last year. The Pacific Mail Steamship Company had already
                            in February last been informed that whilst small numbers of Chinese
                            males arriving here in their boats via San Francisco, even up to 100 at
                            a time, would not be interfered with, any larger numbers would be <pb
                                n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0384"/>treated specially, and, if
                            admitted at all, the men would be subjected to a period of quarantine
                            and their effects to fumigation; and the company were further informed
                            that any attempt to bring Chinese coolies in ship-loads would certainly
                            be met by a positive refusal to allow landing.</p>
                        <p>On the 15th of last month a copy of regulations almost identical with
                            those I now forward you was sent to San Francisco, and would be
                            immediately communicated to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, with the
                            intimation that His Majesty’s consul-general at Hong-Kong had received
                            notice by cable of the intention of this Government positively to resist
                            the immigration of coolies. That company has therefore had the most
                            ample warning of the wishes and intentions of the Government. The
                            landing of the Chinese who arrived by the steamers City of Rio de
                            Janeiro and City of Tokio was nevertheless acquiesced in by the
                            Government, because their passengers were represented to have been
                            contracted for previous to the expiring of the permission which the
                            Pacific Mail Steamship Company formerly held. But as that permission
                            expressly stipulated that not more than 600 Chinese laborers should be
                            introduced into the country in any period of three months, there is no
                            valid reason for any further acquiescence. The bringing here in rapid
                            succession of parties of several hundreds of coolies is manifestly an
                            open defiance of the wishes and of the rights of the Government and
                            people of this Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I have to state that measures dealing with the whole
                            subject of Chinese immigration will be submitted for the consideration
                            of the Legislative Assembly at its approaching session.</p>

                        has been submitted to the Legislature, embracing statements in detail of the
                        receipts and expenditures of the Hawaiian Government for the two years
                        ending March 31, 1884, and estimates of the same for a like period ending
                        March 31, 1886.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the report, now printed in an almost unintelligible form, shall
                        have been corrected, copies will be forwarded to you, together with such
                        other department reports as may be presented. Meantime I beg to lay before
                        you a brief synopsis of what is shown by the minister of finance in his
                        biennial communication.</p>
                    <p>The cash receipts of the Hawaiian Government from all sources excepting
                        loans, for two years’ ending March 31, 1884, were considerably less than the
                        expenditures for that period. By these expenditures were absorbed, less
                        $2,220.42 in the treasury March 31, 1884, the following funds: <table

                    <p>From which it will be seen that for the two years ending March 31, 1884, the
                        expenditures of the Government, $3,216,406.05, exceeded the actual receipts,
                        $2,423,185.42 (deducting loans, $668,900, and the difference in the cash
                        balances of 1882 and 1884, $124,321.63, to the large amount of
                        $793,220.63.</p>
                    <p>It is gratifying to note, however, that the estimates of expenditures <pb
                            n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0385"/>for the two years ending March.31,
                        1886, are placed at nearly $1,000,000 below the outlays for the preceding
                        biennial period, and $65,027.08 within the estimated receipts. The receipts
                        are estimated at $2,336,870.42 and the expenditures at $2,271,843.34.</p>
                    <p>The principal reduction is made in the interior department, which during the
                        past two years expended $473,050.86 for the encouragement of immigration,
                        and as much more, perhaps, in public works and improvements.</p>
                    <p>No further appropriations are asked for the encouragement of immigration, and
                        public works will be sparingly undertaken.</p>
                    <p>Should the Legislature manifest a similar spirit of retrenchment, complaints
                        of extravagance wall cease, and there will be less to inspire a larm at the
                        financial outlook of the Kingdom; but this movement in the direction of
                        economy has come none too soon, for the public debt, which on the 31st of
                        March, 1882, was $299,200, had reached $898,800 on the 1st of April, 1884,
                        and is now $1,048,800, $150,000 of bonds of the two million loan having been
                        sold since the latter date.</p>
                    <p>The amount of interest already paid annually is $74,468, and a further
                        increase of the burden is not warranted by any reasonable estimate of the
                        future of these islands. Under the operations of the reciprocity treaty,
                        almost every industry in the Kingdom has prospered greatly during the past
                        seven years. Real property values have advanced from two to ten fold, and
                        general extravagance has been the natural result. It seems that the
                        inevitable reaction of overtrading and overvaluation is now about to follow,
                        largely assisted by what it is not too emphatic to call a calamitous decline
                        in the price of the prominent product of the country—sugar; and the
                        commercial depression with which the islands are threatened calls for the
                        strictest economy in the conduct of the Government. Under the circumstances
                        a further increase in the public indebtedness of the Kingdom, which is in
                        effect a charge upon the sugar industries of the islands, two-thirds of
                        which are sustained by American enterprise and capital, would be alike
                        reckless and unjust, and it is hoped that the two million loan act of the
                        last Legislative Assembly may be repealed before any considerable amount of
                        the remainder of the unsold bonds now in the market can be disposed of.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The commercial and general business outlook of
                        the Hawaiian Islands has been regarded with increasing uneasiness during the
                        past four or five months, and serious financial troubles in the near future
                        are predicted.</p>
                    <p>This condition is due to a steady decline in the prices of raw sugars since
                        the beginning of the year, and to the notorious extravagance and loose
                        management of a majority of the sugar-planters.</p>
                    <p>The most of the plantations are heavily encumbered with indebtedness, paying
                        interest at rates varying from 8 to 12 per cent, per annum and compounding
                        quarterly.</p>
                    <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0386"/>
                    <p>As nearly all the available acreage of the islands has been given to cane,
                        other agricultural industries have been neglected, until almost everything
                        consumed, excepting rice, fruits, fresh meats, and garden products, comes
                        from abroad. This has enhanced the general expenses of living, and impelled
                        a corresponding increase in labor rates, which it is hopeless to expect
                        immigration to more than temporarily affect. Hence, while plantation
                        expenses, even with the practice of unusual economy, have been tending
                        upward for some months, the price of sugar has been steadily declining,
                        until it has become a question whether, taking the plantations as a whole,
                        sugar can be produced and sold without loss at current market rates, even
                        with the advantage of free entry into United States ports.</p>
                    <p>The increased and apparently increasing production of beet sugar in Europe,
                        the opening of competing sugar areas in Mexico, and the growing
                        possibilities of sorghum are all circumstances favorable to a further
                        decline in the price of the commodity to which these islands owe their
                        commercial standing, and planters, as well they may, are watching the market
                        with feverish anxiety.</p>
                    <p>Hawaiian raw sugars, which two years ago were worth from $130 to $140 per ton
                        in San Francisco, are now begging sale at $95 and $97.50. This means about
                        $80 net per ton to the planter. Can he produce sugar without loss at that
                        price? With plantations free from debt and carefully managed, a small profit
                        might possibly be realized at present prices 5 but few of them are in that
                        condition, and the indications are that many of them will be lost to their
                        owners for their mortgages, while the financial stability of their agents
                        and factors will be tested to the utmost by having the plantations thrown
                        upon their hands by foreclosure at double or more of their market value.
                        Other real values would be affected thereby, and the depression would be
                        general and disastrous.</p>
                    <p>As an evidence that such a calamity is not altogether unlooked for by the
                        well informed, I may mention that already land-owners have been recommended
                        by the press to devote a portion of their acres to products other than cane,
                        coupled with the admission that should the price of sugar suffer a further
                        decline, say of 1 cent per pound, it could no longer be cultivated with
                        profit on the Hawaiian Islands. Such an event would at once deprive the
                        group largely of its commercial importance, and place it back in its
                        condition of twenty years ago, for it produces but little to-day besides
                        sugar and rice to exchange for the commodities of other lands.</p>
                    <p>The sugar yield of 1884 will approximate 60,000 tons. What it will amount to

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The throwing into circulation here of nearly
                        $1,000,000 of the new Hawaiian silver coinage has created a demand for gold
                        so pressing, or, rather, has prompted the sugar agents and bankers to keep
                        so large <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0387"/>a part of their gold funds
                        in San Francisco, that other than United States silver suffers a discount of
                        from 5 to 8 per cent, in the purchase of exchange on California. To meet the
                        gold wants of the Government, and possibly in the hope of compelling a
                        return of a reasonable proportion of the gold for which the products of the
                        islands are sold, and which is left in San Francisco for the benefit of
                        exchange, the cabinet council adopted a resolution on the 15th instant
                        instructing the minister of finance to enforce the law of 1876, and on and
                        after the 1st of June proximo compel the payment of all customs duties in
                        United States gold coin.</p>
                    <p>This action occasioned very considerable comment, and the Honolulu Chamber of
                        Commerce took it under consideration; but no means of relief could be
                        devised by that body beyond limiting the silver circulation of the Kingdom
                        to Hawaiian and American coinage, and reducing its legal-tender capacity
                        from $50 to $20.</p>
                    <p>On the 28th instant a resolution was passed by the Legislative Assembly
                        requesting the cabinet council to defer the enforcement of the order for the
                        collection of customs duties in United States gold coin until the currency
                        bills before that body could be more thoroughly considered, and on the 29th
                        instant the cabinet council adopted a resolution according to that
                        request.</p>
                    <p>The failure of the Hawaiian Government for years past to enforce the law of
                        1876, requiring the payment of customs duties in United States gold coin,
                        has been a continued violation of the spirit of the reciprocity treaty of
                        1875, and with silver at a discount of from 5 to 8 per cent., as it now is,
                        the acceptance of such coin in the payment of customs duties is, in effect,
                        an unwarrantable reduction of duty charges to shippers to the extent per
                        cent, of the discount, and to the same extent are the free products of the
                        United States deprived of the benefits accorded by the treaty.</p>
                    <p>Under the circumstances, I feel bound to ask that the law of 1876, requiring
                        the payment of customs duties in United States gold coin, may be hereafter
                        enforced.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform you that the
                        Pacific Mail Steamship Company’s steamers plying between San Francisco and
                        Australia continue to deliver the public mails at this port, but decline all
                        passenger and freight traffic between San Francisco and the Hawaiian
                        Islands.</p>
                    <p>This singular proceeding is regarded with general dissatisfaction here, and
                        is manifestly the result of some business arrangement between that company
                        and the Spreckels firm, controlling the Oceanic Steamship Company. As the
                        financial strength of the former forbids the presumption of coercion in the
                        matter, it is probable that a satisfactory consideration has been the moving
                        power, possibly to the extent of the subsidy of $2,000 per trip ($48,000 per
                        annum) which the Legislature has been asked to vote the Oceanic Steamship
                        Company. But whatever may <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0388"/>have been
                        the controlling motive or consideration, it cannot but be considered
                        unfortunate for Hawaii that individual power has been found to be competent
                        to so embarrass its commerce and choke its channels of trade.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my dispatch of the 31st ultimo (No. 152) I
                        had the honor to refer to the continued collection of Hawaiian customs
                        duties in silver foreign to the United States and Hawaii and of low
                        commercial value, when the existing law on the subject requires all customs
                        payments to be made in gold coin of the United States.</p>
                    <p>As the silver accepted in the payment of customs duties has for some weeks
                        past been selling at a discount of from 5 to 10 per cent, in exchange for
                        gold, I deemed it my duty to direct the attention of His Majesty’s
                        Government to the subject, claiming that the collection of customs duties in
                        such silver operated substantially as a reduction in duty rates, and was not
                        in accord with the spirit and purposes of the treaty of 1875. I inclose a
                        copy of my note to his excellency, the minister of foreign affairs, under
                        date of May 31st ultimo.</p>
                    <p>In his reply of the 3d instant (inclosure No. 2) the minister of foreign
                        affairs, without referring to the question of the good faith of his
                        Government in accepting foreign silver at rates above its commercial value
                        in the payment of customs duties, denies that such silver is accepted at the
                        custom-house, but at the same time admits that the “gold checks “of the bank
                        of Bishop &amp; Co., in which the most of the customs duties are paid, are,
                        through an understanding with the Government, cashed into the treasury in
                        silver.</p>
                    <p>This very unsatisfactory explanation seemed to call for a more specific
                        statement of the situation, and on the 5th instant I addressed a second
                        communication (inclosure No. 3) to the minister of foreign affairs, showing
                        that the “gold checks” of Bishop &amp; Co., are or may be drawn for Mexican
                        dollars at par, and in the same currency may be redeemed into the treasury,
                        thus giving shippers the privilege of paying their customs duties in the
                        face value of silver worth from 10 to 12 per cent, less than gold.</p>
                    <p>To this his excellency promptly replied (inclosure No. 4, June 5), admitting
                        that the acceptance of foreign silver in the payment of customs duties, if
                        import charges are thereby in effect reduced, is a departure from the spirit
                        of the treaty of 1875, which had escaped the attention of His Majesty’s
                        Government, and promising early action by the Legislative Assembly providing
                        for the resumption of the collection of customs duties in gold coin of the
                        United States or its equivalent.</p>
                    <p>My final note on the subject (inclosure No. 5, June 6), accepts with
                        satisfaction the liberal and friendly concessions of His Majesty’s
                        Government, and relies upon the Legislative Assembly to restore the gold
                        standard in the collection of customs duties.</p>
                    <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0389"/>
                    <p>To accomplish this object a number of bills are now before the Legislature,
                        and I feel confident that the payment of duty charges in foreign silver will
                        soon be discontinued.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: When the reciprocity treaty of 1875 was
                            ratified by our respective Governments the legal-tender currency and
                            unit of commercial value in the Hawaiian Kingdom, as fixed by Chapter
                            XXVII of the sessions laws of 1872, were the dollar of the United States
                            and its subsidiary subdivisions. Chapter XLI of the sessions laws of
                            1876 repealed that statute, and, among other currency regulations,
                            provided that the gold coins of the United States should be the standard
                            and legal tender in the Kingdom, and that thereafter all duties on
                            Hawaiian imports should “be paid in the gold coins of the United States
                            or their equivalent.”</p>
                        <p>For reasons not plainly apparent, the law of 1876, so far, at least, as
                            it relates to the payment of customs duties, has not been enforced, but
                            duties on Hawaiian imports have been and are still being paid and
                            received in the debased silver coins of all countries, and accepted by
                            the Hawaiian customs authorities at rates from 10 to 20 per cent, in
                            excess of their real commercial value and as much below their
                            equivalence with the “gold coins of the United States.”</p>
                        <p>I am prone to believe that the great injustice to the commerce of the
                            United States caused by this deviation from the provisions of the law of
                            1876, as also from the provisions of the statute which that law
                            repealed, must have escaped the observation of His Majesty’s
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>If so, I need but direct your excellency’s attention to the fact that the
                            character of silver now being received for customs duties was selling
                            yesterday at a discount, in exchange for United States gold, of 10 per
                            cent, below the value at which it is accepted by the Hawaiian customs
                            authorities in the payment of import duties, arid to the further fact
                            that the acceptance of such silver in the payment of customs charges
                            operates substantially as a reduction of duty rates to shippers to the
                            extent per cent, of the discount, and to the same extent are the
                            products of the United States entitled to free entry deprived of the
                            benefits accorded them by the treaty of 1875. In other words, the
                            shipper who pays his duties in silver purchased at 90 per cent, for
                            gold, in reality pays ho duties at all.</p>
                        <p>Permit me to say that the liability to customs charges of the wares of
                            all other nations is an element of the treaty equally essential with the
                            exemption from duty of certain products of the United States. Hence,
                            since the Hawaiian Government could not in good faith directly remove
                            all duty charges from foreign imports, it will scarcely be claimed that
                            it may do so indirectly by accepting in the payment of duties debased
                            silver at from 8 to 10 per cent, above its current value. In view of the
                            increasing rates of exchange, and the manifest contravention of the
                            spirit of the treaty of 1875 in the acceptance by the Hawaiian
                            Government of debased silver at rates above its value in the payment of
                            import duties, I respectfully present the matter to His Majesty’s
                            Government, and, in a spirit of great friendship, ask that measures may
                            be taken either to enforce the law of 1876, or in some other manner
                            acceptable to His Majesty’s Government provide for the payment of duties
                            on foreign imports in the “gold coins of the United States or their
                            equivalent.”</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your excellency’s letter of 31st ultimo, in which you express
                            the opinion that there has been a contravention of the spirit of the
                            treaty of 1875 between this country and the United States of America in
                                <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0390"/>the acceptance by the
                            Hawaiian Government of debased silver at the rates above its value in
                            payment of import duties, and ask that measures may be taken either to
                            enforce the law of 1876 or in some other manner to provide for the
                            payment of duties in the “gold coins of the United States or their
                            equivalent.”</p>
                        <p>In reply, I have to assure your excellency that you have been misinformed
                            as to the facts in regard to the subject-matter of your letter. Silver
                            and silver certificates are not and never have been received by the
                            Hawaiian custom-house in payment for import duties, except for
                            fractional amounts that are not represented in United States gold coin.
                            The Government has for many years past permitted the substitution of
                            what are known as “gold checks” for actual coin. These are checks on the
                            bank of Bishop &amp; Co., bearing on their face the promise of that firm
                            for their payment in United States gold coin. An arrangement has also
                            existed for many years between the Hawaiian treasury and Bishop &amp;
                            Co. for forbearance on both sides to demand gold for payments due from
                            the one to the other until after a reasonable notice. The numerous
                            drafts on the treasury which Messrs. Bishop &amp; Co. have to present
                            are in this way set off against the gold checks for which they are
                            responsible (including bonds and coupons falling due). In this way the
                            Government and the bank have acted the part of a clearing-house for
                            innumerable transactions, and saved the community much inconvenience,
                            and the gold coin, which would otherwise have been in use, much wear and
                            tear. Your excellency will therefore perceive that the Government has
                            all along enforced the law of 1876, and taken measures to provide for
                            the payment of duties on foreign imports in gold coins of the United
                            States or their equivalent.</p>
                        <p>I note that your excellency calls the silver coin which is legal tender
                            here “debased silver.” I am aware that there is a small amount of
                            foreign coin in circulation which is below weight through long wear or
                            from being mutilated. This will occur in any country, and no one is
                            obliged to accept such deficient coin as money. As to the bulk of the
                            silver circulating here as legal tender, I submit that the term “debased
                            silver” is not applicable to it. Some of it is United States silver,
                            some is of more intrinsic value than the American coin with which it is
                            rated to pass, and the rest is legitimate coin of foreign countries,
                            passing at a conventional value which suits the convenience of the
                            public.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your excellency’s note of the 3d instant, in reply to mine of
                            the 31st ultimo, suggesting the justice of the collection of Hawaiian
                            customs duties hereafter in United States gold coin or its
                            equivalent.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency assumes that I “have been misinformed as to the facts in
                            regard to the subject-matter” of my letter, and then ventures the
                            extraordinary declaration that “silver and silver certificates are not
                            and never have been received by the Hawaiian custom-house in payment for
                            import duties except for fractional amounts that are not represented in
                            United States gold coin.”</p>
                        <p>Allow me to assure your excellency that I am perfectly informed as to the
                            methods by which the “gold checks” of Messrs. Bishop &amp; Co. have for
                            years past been issued to shippers for silver, have been received at
                            their face value in the payment of customs duties, and, on presentation,
                            have been cashed in silver or silver certificates. The checks are
                            purchased by shippers for silver, and in silver or silver certificates
                            are they cashed into the treasury, and the word “gold,” playfully
                            mentioned on their face as the medium of their redemption, represents
                            nothing beyond the agreement of the Government with Messrs. Bishop &amp;
                            Co. that payment will not be exacted in that currency.</p>
                        <p>Customs duties, under existing regulations, may be paid as follows: The
                            merchant, having an account with the bank of Messrs. Bishop &amp; Co.,
                            the medium through which the customs authorities largely deal with
                            shippers, may sell his gold for Mexican dollars worth 87½ cents, may
                            deposit those dollars at their face value, may draw his check thereon to
                            the amount required, and receive from the bank in exchange therefor a
                            “gold check” of precisely the same amount, with which he may pay his
                            customs duties. These “gold checks “are turned into the treasury, and,
                            on presentation to the bank, may be cashed either in Mexican dollars or
                            in silver certificates of the Government, which may be issued at par on
                            a deposit of Mexican dollars.</p>
                        <p>Thus the shipper is practically enabled to pay, and the Government may
                            actually receive, his customs dues in Mexican dollars, and while it may
                            be true that “silver <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0391"/>and silver
                            certificates are not and never have been received by the Hawaiian
                            custom-house in payment for import duties except for fractional amounts
                            that are not represented in United States gold coin,” your excellency
                            omits to mention that the collector of customs, who sternly demands gold
                            from the occasional small shipper who pays to him directly, is
                            authorized to accept from the larger and more important importer the
                            “gold checks” of the bank, which are at once redeemed into the treasury
                            in silver or silver certificates, and the obligations of the bank to
                            meet its “gold checks” in gold are canceled as fast as made, by the
                            redemption in silver and return of the checks.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency also omits to mention the purpose of the adoption of a
                            resolution by His Majesty’s cabinet council, on the 15th ultimo,
                            requiring the payment of customs duties in United States gold coin” on
                            and after the 1st day of June, 1884,” the enforcement of which
                            resolution has since been deferred. If silver was not then received for
                            customs duties, why was their payment in gold required after the 1st day
                            of June?</p>
                        <p>“Debased coins” are such as have been punched, bored “sweated,” or
                            intentionally mutilated to such an extent as to deprive them of any
                            portion of their intrinsic value. Thus, the value fixed upon a punched
                            dollar by the United States Treasury is 65 cents, a punched half-dollar
                            35 cents, and a punched quarter-dollar 15 cents. While such mutilations
                            are unusually common among the coins quite freely circulating here, I
                            beg your excellency to relieve me of the intention of stating that such
                            currency constitutes the bulk of the silver legal tender of the Hawaiian
                            Islands. While such mutilated coins may not be accepted at the Hawaiian
                            treasury, they are easily convertible in small sums into a currency for
                            which the bank’s “gold checks “may be obtained at par.</p>
                        <p>As your excellency admits the arrangement with the Messrs. Bishop &amp;
                            Co. by which their so-called “gold checks “are received for customs
                            duties, and as I have shown that such “gold checks” are issued for
                            silver of low commercial value, and in such silver or its certificates
                            are redeemed into the Hawaiian treasury, I respectfully resubmit to His
                            Majesty’s Government the request embodied in my note of the 31st ultimo;
                            and, in doing so, permit me to say that I do not present the matter in
                            the form of a demand either on the part of my Government or myself. The
                            acceptance of foreign silver above its commercial value in the payment
                            of customs duties cannot but operate as a disadvantage to American
                            commerce not contemplated at the time of the ratification of the treaty
                            of reciprocity between the United States and Hawaii, and the continuance
                            of the treaty relations now happily existing between the two countries
                            must depend largely upon the disposition and efforts of both to carry
                            out the spirit no less than the letter of their mutual covenants.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your letter of this day’s date, in which your excellency
                            informs me that the “gold checks” issued by merchants for customs
                            duties, and indorsed as such by Messrs. Bishop &amp; Co., are obtained
                            for Mexican dollars at equal face value, or for other silver coin or
                            silver certificates, and are paid by the bank to the treasury in the
                            same forms of currency, and repeats there-quest that duties on foreign
                            imports be collected by the Government in United States gold coin or its
                            equivalent.</p>
                        <p>In reply I have to inform your excellency that this subject is under the
                            consideration of the Legislature, and is likely to receive a prompt
                            solution in accord with the views and wishes expressed in your
                            letter.</p>
                        <p>I may at the same time remind your excellency that when the reciprocity
                            treaty between this Kingdom and the United States was negotiated the
                            currency law of 1872 was in force, and silver was the only standard
                            here. I do not think that the possibility of the occurrence of the
                            exceptional circumstances of the present day was foreseen on either side
                            at that time, or that when, at a late period, the arrangement as to
                            “gold checks” was made, a probability of its interfering with the
                            protection accorded by the treaty with the United States to the products
                            and manufactures of that country was thought of.</p>
                        <p>So far as the Government and Messrs. Bishop &amp; Co. are concerned, the
                            forbearance to collect gold when the law called for it has been mutual.
                            If, however, the existing arrangement enables importers of dutiable
                            goods virtually to pay 9 per cent, duties instead of 10 per cent., even
                            though this be temporary, there is a manifest departure <pb n="292"
                                xml:id="pg_292" facs="0392"/>from the intention of the treaty—a
                            departure which the Government has no desire to countenance. I trust
                            that I shall be able to communicate to your excellency the decision of
                            the Legislature (at whose express wish the order recently made by the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your excellency’s note of yesterday, conveying your
                            acceptance of the position that the payment of Hawaiian customs duties
                            in foreign silver of low commercial value, as may be done through
                            existing methods, “‘is a manifest departure from the intention of the
                            treaty—a departure which the Government has no desire to countenance,”
                            and the further information that the Legislative Assembly has now under
                            consideration a measure providing for the collection of customs duties
                            in gold coin, upon which you hope to apprise me of favorable action “in
                            the Course of a few days.”</p>
                        <p>Allow me to repeat to your excellency that the collection of customs
                            duties in foreign silver, as it now rates with gold, is not merely a
                            lessening of duty charges from 10 per cent, to 9, but substantially a
                            reduction from 10 per cent, to the per cent, of difference between such
                            silver and gold in exchange for each other, and that the “silver
                            standard “of the law of 1872, which was in force at the time of the
                            ratification of the treaty of 1875, was specifically United States
                            silver, to the collection of duties in which to-day no valid objection
                            could be urged.</p>
                        <p>Thanking your excellency for the very just and liberal spirit in which,
                            after full explanation, you have met my suggestions in the matter,</p>

                        to establish a United States gold standard in the Hawaiian Kingdom has
                        become a law. It provides that after the 1st day of December next United
                        States and <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0393"/>Hawaiian gold and silver
                        coins only shall be legal tender at their nominal value; that all other
                        coins will be received at their bullion value; that the silver certificates
                        of the Government above the denomination of $10 shall be redeemed in gold;
                        and that other than United States and Hawaiian silver coins shall be taken
                        at the treasury at their nominal value and exchanged for United States gold
                        coin. It gives to United States and Hawaiian silver coins a legal-tender
                        capacity to the extent of $10, and provides for the issuance of gold
                        certificates of deposit by the treasury.</p>
                    <p>Formal notification of the passage and approval of the new currency measure
                        was communicated to me on the 8th instant by his excellency the minister of
                        foreign affairs. A friendly interview with the ministry resulted in the
                        acceptance of the view that the passage and approval of the currency act
                        restored to force, without further action, the cabinet council resolution of
                        May 15 last, providing for the payment of customs duties in gold, and the
                        minister of finance was authorized to instruct the collector-general that
                        from and after the 1st day of August proximo gold coin of the United States
                        would alone be received for customs duties. This instruction has been given,
                        and also a notification to the public, and on and after the 1st proximo
                        customs duties will be collected only in United States gold coin or its
                        equivalent.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In transmitting to the Department, as herewith
                        inclosed, the translation of a dispatch of President Salomon, addressed
                        through me to the diplomatic corps, dated as of the 4th instant, I have the
                        honor to invite your attention specially to the fact that after detailing
                        the circumstances of the purchase of the ship Eider at St. Thomas, her
                        change of the British for the Haytien flag on her arrival at Jacmel, her
                        employment in the insurgent service, her probable disturbance of the
                        coasting trade of Hayti, especially as respects the interests of foreigners
                        engaged in commerce in this country, and referring to the fact that his
                        Government, by a decree of the 20th of September last, had declared this
                        vessel, known now in the change of her name as La Patrie, a pirate, the
                        President asks the members of the corps to recognize this ship as in fact a
                        real pirate, and have her pursued accordingly. It will be noticed, also,
                        that the President refers in the closing portion of his dispatch to the
                        circumstance that on the 23d of September last the diplomatic and consular
                        corps had seen fit to land troops in Port au Prince, and even menaced the
                        bombardment of his palace and forts, concluding that, if such action could
                        be justly taken, the request which he made as to the ship in question could
                        not be unreasonable.</p>
                    <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0394"/>
                    <p>The fact as stated by the President in such regard is true. But upon due and
                        careful consideration of the whole subject the corps, asking the counsel of
                        the several commanding officers of the war vessels at the time in this
                        harbor in that behalf, including our own captain of the Swatara, P. H.
                        Cooper, could not agree with the President in his judgment in this matter;
                        and accordingly addressed, through its dean, a reply to his dispatch, a copy
                        of which, dated as of the 13th instant, is, as herewith inclosed,
                        transmitted to you. From the date of the reply it will be perceived that it
                        was somewhat delayed. This was so because the President was asked and
                        promised to furnish facts as regards injuries done in fact by the La Patrie
                        to the merchandise of foreigners found on Haytien coasters. Such facts,
                        however, he did not furnish; and, after the reasonable delay, the reply was
                        made. The corps declines, without presenting formal or extended argument in
                        defense of its position, to take the action suggested by the President.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: The enemies of my Government at
                            St. Thomas bought there an old steamer of the Royal Mail and sent it to
                            the insurgents at Jacmel, where it arrived, at the end of August, under
                            the British flag. On this occasion my consul at Saint Thomas exchanged
                            correspondence with the Danish authorities and the consul of England in
                            that place. But it was in vain that he told them that this steamer, then
                            known by the name of the Eider, was bought on account of the insurgents,
                            and would go to Jacmel to carry trouble and injury to Hayti, the
                            Government of which is in good diplomatic relations with these two
                            powers.</p>
                        <p>At Jacmel, the Eider, taking the name of La Patrie, replaced the English
                            flag by the Haytien flag; and since this ship traverses the coasts of
                            the South, the West, and the Artibonite of the Republic, capturing the
                            crafts which it meets and appropriating to itself the imports and
                            commodities which it finds upon them.</p>
                        <p>A decree of my Government of the 20th of September last declares this
                            vessel a pirate and authorizes that she be pursued.</p>
                        <p>Haytien legislation does not accord to foreigners the right of conducting
                            commerce by the coasting trade (which is exclusively reserved to its
                            citizens). Foreign merchants, then, are obliged to confide to the
                            coasting trade the cash which they forward to the different points for
                            the purchase of commodities, which are sent them by the same means of
                            the coasting trade. Then it results, at this moment, that the coasters
                            which encounter the pirate steamer, being captured, the property of
                            foreign merchants which is found thereupon becomes the booty of the
                            insurgents, From which it follows that to avoid loss of their capital
                            and merchandise, these merchants will be absolutely forced to suspend
                            every commercial operation, which will render immobile their capital and
                            will cause them, by consequence, considerable losses. One could
                            comprehend such a situation if those actually in arms against my
                            Government were recognized as belligerents; but not being, the acts
                            which they commit are piracy.</p>
                        <p>If, the 23d of September, the diplomatic and consular corps, in presence
                            of civil disorder which for the moment I was unable to suppress in this
                            capital, had landed armed men and menaced the bombardment of my palace
                            and the forts to arrest this disorder which brought injury to the
                            interests of their citizens, I am authorized to hope that for the same
                            reasons the diplomatic corps will judge it necessary to interfere to
                            stop the depredations which the steamer of the insurgents commits.</p>
                        <p>In presenting to you these considerations, I am persuaded, Mr. Minister,
                            that in the interest of foreign commerce threatened the diplomatic
                            corps, whose president you are, will decide that it is proper to capture
                            the Eider.</p>

                        relations of this Government, addressed me a dispatch, received on the 14th
                        instant, similar to that addressed to each member of the diplomatic and
                        consular corps of this capital, in which he announces the purpose of his
                        Government, according to the address of the President, a copy of which was
                        transmitted inclosed in his dispatch, to bombard respectively Jacmel on the
                        18th and Jérémie on the 21st instant, provided the rebels in such cities
                        have not sooner surrendered to the constitutional government.</p>
                    <p>In the name of humanity the honorable secretary asks any action that may be
                        deemed wise and necessary on behalf of innocent and neutral persons residing

                        bombardment. I have the honor to transmit, as herewith inclosed, copies of
                        the dispatch and address mentioned, with translations of each, and also a

                            returned to the country, two parties existed, the national party, which
                            is the country of which I am the undoubted chief, and the party called
                            liberal, having at its head Buyer Bazelais. This last party, exclusively
                            aristocratic, has become a faction. This faction has ceased to exist.
                            Boyer Bazelais, wounded in the head on the 22d of September, poisoned
                            himself, and died at Miragoane the 27th of October last. To-day, thanks
                            to Divine Providence, my Government is armed with forces which enables
                            it to confound and annihilate the insurrection; it finds this force in
                            the love of its fellow-citizens, and in the confidence and sympathy of
                            which it is the object as well on the part of foreigners as the
                            representatives and agents of the foreign powers residing in Hayti.</p>
                        <p>The hour for the final struggle has come, but, anxious to spare the blood
                            of my fellow-citizens, I make here a supreme and final appeal to the
                            rebels of Jérémie and Jacmel.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, there is accorded to Jacmel to the 18th instant, and to
                            Jérémie to the 21st instant to lay down their arms and recognize the
                            authority of the constitutional government. These delays passed, these
                            two cities will be subdued by force.</p>
                        <p>They shall have no right to mercy, but shall be sought and prosecuted who
                            have assassinated Generals Joachim Vérequain, Aristide Désiré, &amp;c.,
                            who form the revolutionary committee of Jacmel, namely, K. Hippolite,
                            Lefévre, T. Talmy, J. R. Barjon, Chicoye Jenne, J. C. Maximilien, L. T.

                        <p>Fellow-citizens of Jacmel and Jérémie, to persist in resisting the
                            Government is to condemn you, Jérémie and Jacmel, to the inseparable
                            misfortunes of a city taken by assault.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received your number 593, of the 20th
                        ultimo, in relation to the action of President Salomon in declaring the
                        vessel La Patrie a pirate and asking that she be so regarded by foreign
                        governments. The conclusion reached by you, in company with your colleagues,
                        that the consuls could not properly take the steps suggested, is
                        approved.</p>
                    <p>The expedient of declaring a revolted national vessel to be a “pirate” has
                        often been resorted to among the Spanish-American countries in times of
                        civil tumult, and on late occasions in Europe. At the time of the Murcian
                        rising, in 1873, the insurgents at Cartagena seized the Spanish iron-clads
                        in harbor and cruised with them along the coast, committing hostilities. The
                        Spanish Government proclaimed the vessels pirates and invited their capture
                        by any nation. A German naval commander then in the Mediterranean did in
                        fact capture one of the revolted ships and claimed it as a German prize, but
                        his act was disavowed. The rule is, simply, that a “pirate” is the natural
                        enemy of all men, to be repressed by any, and wherever found, while a
                        revolted vessel is the enemy only of the power against which it acts. While
                        it may be outlawed so far as the outlawing state is concerned, no foreign
                        state is bound to respect or execute such outlawry to the extent of treating
                        the vessel as a public enemy of mankind. Treason is not piracy, and the
                        attitude of foreign governments toward the offender may be negative merely
                        so far as demanded by. a proper observance of the principle of
                        neutrality.</p>

                        594, of the 20th ultimo, relative to the notification made by President
                        Salomon that Jérémie and Jacmel would be bombarded on fixed dates if not
                        sooner surrendered.</p>
                    <p>It is observed that in response to the announcement thereof made to you by
                        the provisional secretary of state, you confined yourself to simple
                        acknowledgment and reservation of the rights of any American citizens in
                        those towns. As a technical precaution this was very good as far as it went,
                        but it does not appear that you took any active measures in their behalf;
                        indeed, it is not known that any American citizens were endangered. But if
                        they were, their first right was the privilege as non-combatants of leaving

                        no national vessel was within your reach to dispatch to Jérémie and Jacmel
                        for the purpose of taking off any Americans known or believed to be there,
                        it might at least have <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0398"/>been proper
                        to make an arrangement through one of your colleagues for the reception of
                        American fugitives and their personal property on a vessel of another
                        nationality.</p>

                        is one to be sedulously guarded in every proper way by their national

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit as herewith
                        inclosed a copy of a despatch, with translation, addressed by the President
                        of this Republic to me, dated November 22, 1883.</p>
                    <p>This dispatch is one in which the consuls of France, England, Germany, Spain,
                        and Italy are invited with myself to call at the national palace to confer
                        with President Salomon upon the matter of the indemnity to be accorded to
                        foreigners who suffered in their interests in consequence of the unfortunate
                        events of the 22d and 23d of September last in this city. The conference was
                        held as requested on the 24th ultimo, all the consuls named being in
                        attendance except the consul of Germany, who was absent at the time from
                        Port au Prince. After the President had explained his desires and purposes
                        in the matter the gentlemen representatives present left the palace, after
                        assuring him that the subject should have their serious consideration and
                        that he should hear from them with respect thereto upon the return of the
                        consul of Germany.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, on the 1st instant, the gentlemen mentioned held a conference at
                        this legation, and after due consideration of the subject the undersigned
                        was requested to write the President, asking his consideration and response
                        as to the several points suggested in my note of the 1st instant, a copy of
                        which is herewith transmitted. In this note it will be perceived that the
                        President is asked whether he proposes, in speaking of the losses occurring
                        on the 22d and 23d of September last, to confine himself in considering the
                        question of indemnity to such losses only, or whether he would adopt a
                        policy comprehensive enough to cover and include losses occurring in other
                        places in connection with the efforts of the Government to put down the
                        rebellion of 1879, as at Port au Prince and Gonaives, and the losses
                        occurring in other places than Port-au-Prince in connection with the efforts
                        of the Government made to put down the present insurrectionary movements of
                        the country; what mode of investigation and settlement he would propose; if
                        a mixed commission, how he would propose to constitute it; and in what way
                        he would propose to pay such reclamations as may be adjudged
                        well-founded.</p>
                    <p>A copy of the President’s dispatch, with a translation, is herewith
                        transmitted. After acknowledging the receipt of my note and stating that the
                        losses of the 22d and 23d of September last in this city should be the
                        subject of special examination, the President proceeds to announce his plan
                        of a mixed commission, one-half to be named by his Government, the other
                        half by the representatives of the countries whose citizens <pb n="299"
                            xml:id="pg_299" facs="0399"/>present claims; such commissioners to be
                        instructed by the honorable secretary of state of foreign relations, his
                        instructions to be approved by the representatives as aforesaid; while the
                        mode of payment is left undetermined by him otherwise than that he would
                        have such matter as well as the payment of claims allowed left to the
                        determination and vote of the corps legislatif. He closes his dispatch by
                        expressing the hope that the plan he suggests may prove to be
                        acceptable.</p>
                    <p>A copy of my reply to this last dispatch of the President is herewith
                        transmitted. In my note I simply acknowledge the receipt of his dispatch,
                        and advise him that after the consideration of the subject the several
                        consuls mentioned by him, all supposed to have citizens here who sustained
                        losses in connection with the occurrences of the 22d and 23d of September
                        last, in this city, would hereafter, each for himself, according to his
                        pleasure or his instructions, make reply with regard thereto to his
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>Six of our citizens, Messrs. C. W. Mossell, E. V. Garrido, and Richard Allen,
                        and Mrs. Adolphus E. Williams, Mrs. Hercules Founder, and Maria Hamilton,
                        have filed claims of the character under discussion, aggregating in property
                        lost and damages in personal injuries and insults received something like
                        $100,000. The amount claimed by the persons named for their property lost is
                        only about, at most, $20,000.</p>
                    <p>The matter of damages sustained in personal injuries and insults received, as
                        demanded, would amount to about $80,000; and this last amount is principally
                        made up of the claim of Mr. Mossell, who, with his wife and family was
                        maltreated in the most barbarous manner.</p>
                    <p>It may be that the plan of a mixed commission as proposed by President
                        Salomon would, as far as the loss of property is concerned, answer very
                        well; but as regards the abuse, the maltreatment of our citizens, it might
                        not prove to be advantageous and satisfactory. But with regard to its
                        approval or otherwise, I await your instructions.</p>

                            as you are aware, duly received, and as you requested therein, the
                            consul of France, of England, of Spain, of Italy, and the undersigned
                            met you on the 24th instant at the national palace in conference with
                            regard to the subject matter thereof.</p>
                        <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0400"/>
                        <p>The gentlemen named, including the consul of Germany, who was not with us
                            at the national palace on the 24th instant, held a conference yesterday
                            at this legation, and after full consideration of your note found it
                            desirable to ask of you certain information.</p>
                        <p>You speak of losses connected with the occurrences of the 22d and 23d of
                            September last simply. Do you mean in considering the matter of
                            indemnity as proposed to confine action to such losses only, or would
                            you propose action in that behalf so comprehensive as to include and
                            cover the investigation and settlement of all claims which may be found
                            to have grown out of the movements of the Government in its efforts to
                            suppress the present rebellion in Port au Prince or elsewhere in the
                            country, and also so comprehensive as to cover and include losses
                            connected with the movements of the Government in its efforts to
                            suppress the rebellion of 1879 at Port au Prince and Gonaives? Besides,
                            it has been deemed wise to ask what mode of investigation and settlement
                            you would propose—whether a mixed commission; and, if so, how you would
                            constitute it, and in what way your excellency would propose to pay such
                            reclamations as may be adjudged well-founded?</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: In your dispatch of the 1st
                            instant, you express to me the desire to have certain information with
                            regard to my note of the 23d of October; information which you require
                            in consequence of a conference held at the legation of the United States
                            of America, and where there were present the gentlemen, consuls of
                            France, of England, of Spain, of Italy, and of the Empire of
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>According to the judgment of my Governmnet the events which took place at
                            Port au Prince the 22d and 23d of September last, provoked evidently by
                            the rioters of those days, should be the subject of a special
                            examination, and my desire would be to put aside from such examination,
                            occurrences which have taken place in Hayti at other periods, as well as
                            those which may have been produced in other localities in consequence of
                            these same events.</p>
                        <p>The principle of indemnity once recognized in favor of foreigners who had
                            sustained real damages on the 22d and 23d days of September last, the
                            estimate of their losses should be confided to mixed commissions, the
                            members whereof should be named, half by my Government, half by the
                            representatives of the countries of the claimants, who should have to
                            present in support of their demands all the necessary justificative
                            documents.</p>
                        <p>My secretary of state of foreign relations should give to such mixed
                            commissions instructions as to the manner of procedure, and, in order to
                            protect the interests of the two parties in interest, such instructions
                            should have force only after the official sanction of the
                            representatives of the powers interested.</p>
                        <p>As to that which concerns the mode to be adopted for the payment of the
                            indemnities which may be accorded, I think that it would be difficult,
                            if not impossible, to be decided, at present, in that regard. This mode
                            of payment could only be settled after the nature of the obligations
                            allowed and their importance shall have become known.</p>
                        <p>With common accord let us name the mixed commissions and give them full
                            and precise instructions. Let these commissions, in their turn, call
                            those who claim to have been injured, that they make, evidence in hand,
                            a scrupulous and rigid examination of their claims and that they present
                            to us their reports.</p>
                        <p>It is then, Mr. Minister, that their decisions, which shall be, I have no
                            doubt, impressed with the seal of justice and impartiality, would be
                            conformably to our constitutional law communicated to the legislative
                            chambers, called to inscribe them upon our budget of expenses and to
                            vote the ways and means applicable to such service.</p>
                        <p>The mode of payment of such obligations would then be fixed by this vote,
                            to which force would be given, from the re-establishment of public
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>Such is, Mr. Minister, my manner of meeting the question which occupies
                            us, and I hope that it will have your approbation, as well as that of
                            your colleagues.</p>
                        <p>Accept, Mr. Minister, the renewed assurances of my very high
                            consideration.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatch No. 602, of the 17th of December
                        last, has been received. It transmits a copy of a note addressed to you by
                        President Salomon on the 22d of November last, inviting you to an interview
                        touching the question of indemnity proposed by Hayti to be accorded to
                        foreigners who suffered through the unfortunate events of the 22d and 23d of
                        September, 1883, and at the same time inviting the consuls of France,
                        England, Germany, Spain, and Italy to be present and take part in the
                        interview. In a subsequent note of the 9th of December, a copy of which also
                        accompanies your dispatch, you communicate the view of President Salomon
                        that, according to the judgment of his Government, the events which took
                        place at Port au Prince on the 22d and 23d of September last, provoked
                        evidently by the riots of those days, should be the subject of a special
                        examination, and that his own desire is to put aside from such examination
                        occurrences which have taken place in Hayti at other periods, as well as
                        those which may have been produced in other localities in consequence of
                        these same events. The President further says in that same dispatch
                        addressed to you: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The principle of indemnity once recognized in favor of foreigners who
                                had sustained real damages on the 22d and 23d days of September
                                last, the estimate of their losses should be confided to mixed
                                commissions, the members whereof should be named, half by my
                                [Haytien] Government and half by the representatives of the
                                countries of the claimants, who should have to present in support of
                                their demands all the necessary justificative documents.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The limitation suggested by the President of Hayti, restricting the subject
                        of indemnity to losses sustained by foreigners in Port au Prince during the
                        events of the 22d and 23d of September, and excluding the consideration of
                        losses in other localities of the Republic, resulting from the same events,
                        appears to me somewhat narrow, but as the claim of American citizens of the
                        class now under discussion are, so far as now known, confined to losses at
                        Port au Prince, this Government is not disposed to press that view or to
                        interpose it as an obstacle to the establishment of the proposed
                        commission.</p>
                    <p>The President also conceives that the submission of the claims of all <pb
                            n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0402"/>foreigners whose Governments shall
                        join in the arrangement to one mixed commission, in which all of these
                        Governments shall be represented is, on the whole, preferable to separate
                        joint commissions with each country, and will tend to facilitate a more
                        speedy and just settlement than could reasonably be hoped for from a
                        separate commission for each, and conscious of the high sense of justice by
                        which the Haytien Government is animated in this as in all other matters, no
                        objection is made to that Government having the power to name one-half of
                        the members of the tribunal.</p>
                    <p>The examination by the commission should also, as suggested by President
                        Salomon, be confined to the consideration of actual and real losses growing
                        out of the events referred to. This Government, however, reserves to itself
                        the right, after full examination by this Department, to present
                        diplomatically any claim of one of its citizens based on the withholding or
                        abuse of any personal rights of such citizen of the United States or
                        indignities to their persons by the officers of the Haytien Government.</p>
                    <p>There is still one other question to which your attention is invited in
                        connection with any proposed agreement for such a commission. President
                        Salomon observes that the mode of payment could only be settled after the
                        nature of the obligations allowed and their importance shall have become
                        known, and that such question must, in conformity to the constitutional law
                        of Hayti, be submitted to the legislative chambers.</p>
                    <p>This Government would not feel disposed to assent to any arrangement for the
                        establishing of a mixed commission, which, after subjecting the citizens to
                        the inconvenience and expense of formulating their claims and collecting and
                        adducing evidence and proofs in support of such claims, and accepting the
                        awards of the commission, would still leave entirely unsettled the question
                        of satisfaction of these awards by Hayti, both as to time and mode of
                        payment. A stipulation should therefore be embraced in the agreement binding
                        that Government to abide by the results of the commission’s labors, and to
                        satisfy the awards made against it by payment to this Government, within a
                        fixed period, the amount of the several awards made on account of the
                        claimants who may be citizens of the United States.</p>
                    <p>I inclose a draft copy of an agreement which may aid you in considering the
                        question in connection with the consuls of the several other powers who may
                        enter into the arrangement.</p>
                    <p>Before concluding or signing any agreement that may be determined upon
                        between the Haytien Government and the representatives of the several
                        Governments concerned, you will forward an authentic copy to this
                        Department.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your dispatch No. 265, dated as
                        of the 7th ultimo, having reference to the settlement of the claims of our
                        citizens who sustained losses in connection with the events taking place in
                        this city on the 22d and 23d days of September last, I have the honor to
                        transmit a copy, with translation herewith inclosed, of a paper addressed by
                        the <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0404"/>honorable secretary of state of
                        foreign relations of this Government to the gentlemen commissioners
                        appointed on its behalf to examine and determine the amount to be allowed to
                        foreigners who present claims for losses as indicated. To the terms and
                        conditions of this paper the secretary has informed me that the
                        representatives of the English and French Governments have given their
                        assent, and the claims of their citizens are being now considered by mixed
                        commissions composed of such number of Haytiens and English and French as
                        may be agreed, according to such terms and conditions. In other words, each
                        representative organizes with the Government a commission to investigate the
                        claims of his citizens and determine what shall be paid them.</p>
                    <p>It will be found that the instructions given the commission, and to which is
                        supposed approval will be given by each representative, unless modifications
                        be made and agreed upon, concern under this paper, the fixing upon competent
                        evidence, the amount which shall be paid a claimant, the same being the
                        direct result of the pillage or fire occurring on the days named; the
                        commission acting as a court of arbitration, whose decisions are not to be
                        revised, but to be final; and in case of an equal division of the commission
                        upon any vote an umpire shall be chosen.</p>
                    <p>Such is in substance the paper inclosed, with this addition, that no limit of
                        the power of inquiry on the part of the commission is fixed so far as the
                        discovery of the facts in a given case is concerned.</p>
                    <p>This paper has been given me in an obliging manner (officieusement) for my
                        consideration and decision as to whether I will consent to have the losses
                        of American citizens determined and settled in the way indicated. To such
                        end I await the instruction of the Department.</p>

                                fellow-citizens:</hi></p>
                        <p>The most important interests of the nation are placed in your hands by
                            the high and delicate mission which has now been confided to you. The
                            Government has, at this juncture, placed its reliance upon your
                            patriotism and enlightenment, and it trusts that you will devore all the
                            activity in your power to its service, to the end that the conferences
                            which you are about to open may be brought to a happy issue.</p>
                        <p>I do not propose to draw up, in these few lines, a complete series of
                            instructions for your guidance in the discharge of your duties; it will
                            suffice for me to call your attention to some points of the question to
                            be settled, and to state how this question has hitherto been regarded by
                            the Government, with whose views and wishes you will “thus be made
                            acquainted.</p>
                        <p>Your task is, as you are aware, to fix the amount of the indemnities to
                            be awarded to foreigners who suffered direct losses at the time of the
                            occurrences which took place at Port au Prince on the 22d and 23d of
                            September last.</p>
                        <p>While leaving the responsibility for those scenes of disorder, pillage,
                            and arson to the rioters of that time, the Government has thought that
                            it is now its duty to avoid all difficulties and annoying complications
                            with foreign powers; it has even anticipated the presentation of claims
                            by declaring that it recognizes them in principle, it being happy to
                            give, under these circumstances, the most convincing evidence of its
                            determination to offer every guarantee to foreigners coming to reside
                            among us, and to foreign capital invested in Hayti.</p>
                        <p>This principle being recognized, it remains for you, taking into
                            consideration all the incontrovertible elements that bear upon the
                            matter, to enter upon the discussion of the amount of the indemnities
                            with the foreign commissions whose members have been appointed by the
                            heads of the legations established in this city.</p>
                        <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0405"/>
                        <p>The English and French commissions now organized are about to begin their
                            work, and I desire that you will come to an immediate understanding with
                            them, and that you will fix the order of your conferences in such a
                            manner as to give full and entire satisfaction to both of them.</p>
                        <p>The work of the mixed commissions will not be subject to revision; you
                            are to decide in the capacity of a soverign body, and from your
                            decisions there is to be no appeal; the statement of this fact will
                            suffice to enable you to form a correct estimate of the great confidence
                            which is reposed in you by the Government, and will thus induce you to
                            use all the care, discernment, tact, and impartiality that will be
                            required in the cases which you will have to decide.</p>
                        <p>You are clothed with the powers of a court of arbitration, and in case of
                            tie on the subject of an indemnity to be granted, you will be obliged to
                            appeal to the decision of an umpire.</p>
                        <p>Your investment with these ample powers renders it your duty, permit me
                            to repeat, to spare no pains for the purpose of collecting the fullest
                            evidence with regard to the facts to be examined and the deplorable
                            consequences which have resulted therefrom.</p>
                        <p>You must have recourse to the best and purest sources of evidence for the
                            purpose of obtaining material on which to base your decision, so that
                            they may inspire absolute confidence.</p>
                        <p>After the preparatory work has been performed, which will necessarily
                            consist in the preparation of the list of claimants, in which the amount
                            of the indemnity claimed must be placed opposite to each name, you will
                            cause a statement of the facts on which the claim is based to be filed,
                            together with all the evidence that may be adduced in corroboration
                            thereof.</p>
                        <p>The discussion of the merits of the claims may then be commenced, and
                            they will be decided by you after conscientious and careful
                            examination.</p>
                        <p>You are not to lose sight of the fact that the object of your mission
                            consists in determining the amounts of the indemnities to be awarded to
                            foreigners whose interests have been directly affected by acts of
                            pillage or by fire growing out of the events which took place at Port au
                            Prince on the 22d and 23d of September last. It is sufficient to remind
                            you that you must reject claims based upon indirect damages growing out
                            of these acts. No controversy exists with regard to the settlement of
                            these questions. Recent examples are at hand to prove this.</p>
                        <p>In addition to your already ample powers, the Government gives you an
                            unlimited right of inquiry. This will be the main pivot of your
                            proceedings; and it is important that you should exercise this right in
                            the broadest manner, so as to secure accurate information in the conduct
                            of your examinations.</p>
                        <p>Seek, by all possible means, the proofs that are lacking to you, summon
                            and examine witnesses, enlighten your judgment by having recourse to all
                            reliable sources, and especially to those official sources of
                            information which cannot fail you.</p>
                        <p>Suppose indemnity is claimed on account of a loss of merchandise. In the
                            absence of a balance-sheet, or of any other satisfactory documentary
                            evidence, will not the custom-house papers furnish you the data
                            necessary to enable you to form a correct estimate of the nature and
                            importance of the claimant’s business?</p>
                        <p>I adduce but this one example, which it will be proper for you to
                            generalize by having recourse to other departments of the public
                            service, if need be. Such are, in substance, the general instructions by
                            which you are to be guided in your proceedings.</p>
                        <p>The detailed report, which you will address to me at the close of your
                            labors, together with the proper accompaniments, reports of your
                            sessions, &amp;c., will enable the Government immediately to begin the
                            work of preparing a bill to be laid before the legislative body,
                            determining the manner of paying the claims allowed.</p>
                        <p>It is proper for me to inform you that these instructions have been
                            communicated to the heads of the legations of England and France, who
                            fully approve them. You may, therefore, begin your labors as soon as you
                            shall have received them.</p>
                        <p>If, in the course of your investigations, any points of detail that I
                            have been unable to foresee shall cause you any embarrassment, you will
                            be pleased to inform me thereof. I shall hasten to come to an
                            understanding on this subject with the heads of the foreign legations,
                            and I feel convinced that, with the spirit of kindness, conciliation and
                            justice whereby they are all actuated, they will not fail to lend me
                            their co-operation in removing the difficulties and enabling you to
                            terminate, to the satisfaction of all parties, the delicate and
                            important task which has been intrusted to you.</p>
                        <p>Accept, gentlemen and esteemed fellow-citizens, the assurances of my
                            distinguished consideration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Honorable Sir</hi>: According to letter I had the
                            honor to receive from your Department in reply to mine, inquiring as to
                            the rights of American citizens before the courts in Hayti, in
                            accordance with Article VI of the treaty between these two countries, I
                            duly filed with the civil court of Port au Prince an assignment of my
                            assets for the benefit of my creditors, this being the sole and only way
                            to a discharge from said obligations, having been informed by your
                            Department that I was entitled to all the rights and privileges accorded
                            to Haytien subjects.</p>
                        <p>I now again ask that our minister resident be informed of these views,
                            and that my rights be protected by him.</p>
                        <p>Having availed myself of these rights, on the 6th day of this month I was
                            arrested and taken to jail upon a warrant, and upon informing the
                            authorities that by an order issued in the official journal it was made
                            obligatory that before a foreigner could be placed in jail, the
                            complaint should first be submitted to the attorney for the Government
                            for his examination and approval, and signed with his signature, with
                            seal attached, I was told that my commitment must stand, and that I must
                            remain in jail, confined with felons, lunatics, and the like, surrounded
                            by filth, and my health endangered. To this last fact I have, and did
                            present, to the authorities the certificates of three physicians, one of
                            them being Dr. Terres, vice-consul of the United States.</p>
                        <p>After argument it was decided on the 18th that my imprisonment was
                            illegal on the original papers, but, being in trouble, had caused others
                            to step in and cause my detention upon other and different claims which
                            have to be argued, and in mean time I am confined.</p>
                        <p>Mr Secretary, I most respectfully ask that protection be afforded me, and
                            that proper satisfaction be obtained for my first illegal imprisonment,
                            and from which followed other troubles, and also for damages that may
                            occur to me from exposure and suffering incurred by my not being allowed
                            to go to hospital or be confined in a suitable place with some sanitary
                            condition, not in a Calcutta hole, the fact being well known, as
                            attested to by the three physicians, of the precarious state of my
                            general health.</p>
                        <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0407"/>
                        <p>In addition I would state that the non-fulfillment by the Haytien
                            Government of its legal obligations is the real cause of my inability to
                            meet my obligations, my family holding its bonds far in excess of my
                            debts, and which bonds, if paid, would be used to liquidate my
                            indebtedness. I notice our minister is pressing a settlement of
                            these.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your dispatch No. 272, dated
                        April 21, 1884, having reference to the arrest and imprisonment of Mr. O. A.
                        Yan Bokkelen in this city, I have to state that I have given such subject
                        due investigation; and beg now to submit that it is true that, in accordance
                        with the law of this country, which permits the imprisonment of debtors, on
                        or about the 6th of March last, Mr. Yan Bokkelen was arrested and
                        imprisoned, upon a judgment rendered against him some months before for some
                        $3,000 in favor of Messrs. Toplitz &amp; Co., of New York City.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the suit of Messrs. Toplitz &amp; Co. against Mr. Yan Bokkelen
                        it is proper to state that it seems to have been thoroughly contested as
                        between the parties thereto in the lower and upper courts of the country,
                        having been commenced in what is called here the court of commerce, and
                        finally reviewed and passed upon in the court of last resort, the court of
                        cassation.</p>
                    <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0408"/>
                    <p>Having been arrested and imprisoned as indicated, other parties to whom Mr.
                        Van Bokkelen was indebted, the National Bank, Louis Nadal, and Saint Aude,
                        instituted proceedings also against him upon their several claims as allowed
                        by Haytien law and usage, which worked other and additional confinement in
                        prison.</p>
                    <p>But after his arrest and confinement upon the judgment of Messrs. Toplitz
                        &amp; Co. it was, upon certain proceedings instituted by Mr. Van Bokkelen in
                        the civil tribunal, decided that his imprisonment upon such judgment was not
                        legal, for the reason that Mr. Archin, the lawyer of such parties, in
                        ordering the arrest and imprisonment of Mr. Yan Bokkelen had done so without
                        special authority in that behalf as required by the law of this country, and
                        so the matter stands to day so far as the judgment of Messrs. Toplitz &amp;
                        Co. is concerned, for no amended proceeding has been instituted in that
                        regard as against Mr. Van Bokkelen. He has been confined since the finding
                        and judgment of the civil tribunal referred to upon the <hi rend="italic"
                            >recommendation</hi>, as the Haytien law phrases the proceeding, of the
                        other creditors named.</p>
                    <p>But subsequently to the rendition of the judgment in favor of Messrs. Toplitz
                        &amp; Co. against Mr. Van Bokkelen, the latter undertook to make, under the
                        laws of Hayti, a judicial assignment of all his property, in favor of his
                        creditors generally, and thus secure for himself what is termed in French
                        law language, <hi rend="italic">le bénefice de la cession de biens</hi>, as
                        provided for all Haytien debtors under the law of this country. Mr. Van
                        Bokkelen in this proceeding would not deny that he is a foreigner, an
                        American citizen, residing in Hajti. But he claims that although he is a
                        foreigner, being an American citizen, under the treaty of 1864, articles 6
                        and 9, in spite of any language contained in the civil code of Hayti
                        discriminating in the particular mentioned, against foreigners, even though
                        the phrase used therein be “<hi rend="italic">les étrangers</hi>,” he is by
                        the treaty put upon the same footing, as to this right and its exercise,
                        with the Haytien himself. The civil tribunal, however, of this city, in
                        which he instituted his procedings, as indicated, has decided against him as
                        to his right.</p>
                    <p>The case is to be appealed, as it is understood, to the court of cassation,
                        where it is possible, though not probable, that the judgment of the under
                        court may be reversed.</p>
                    <p>Meantime Mr. Van Bokkelen, who, at my request, not being well at all, has
                        been permitted to occupy quarters in the military hospital of this city,
                        remains in what is understood to be confinement.</p>
                    <p>I have watched this case of Mr. Van Bokkelen from the very moment of its
                        beginning, I have no doubt that under the law of this country, properly
                        interpreted and applied, in connection with the treaty of 1864 as already
                        mentioned, Mr. Van Bokkelen has a right to make an assignment of his
                        property in the interest of his creditors, as he seeks to do judicially, and
                        should thereupon be released from prison.</p>
                    <p>In a conversation with the President yesterday, with regard to this case, I
                        advised him that I might, at an early day, have occasion to address his
                        Government with relation thereto, having in mind, as I did at the time, that
                        the prison of this city is really not fit for the confinement of a debtor,
                        that the military hospital is very little better, and that Mr. Van Bokkelen
                        is quite unwell, suffering from rheumatism and predisposition to
                        consumption.</p>
                    <p>I await any instructions which the Department may deem it wise to give in
                        this case.</p>
                    <p>I am, &amp;c.,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit, as herewith
                        inclosed, a copy of the exposé or message of President Salomon, presented to
                        the National Assembly on the 7th of last month, as published in the official
                        part of “Le Moniteur,” the organ of the Government, on the 14th, 19th, 21st,
                        26th, and 28th ultimo.</p>
                    <p>In that part of the exposé which concerns foreign relations, the President
                        alludes first of all to the unfortunate insurrectionary events which
                        occurred in Port au Prince on the 22d and 23d days of September, 1883. He
                        claims that such events, in view of the revolutionary condition of the
                        country at the time, the attempts which were made by the insurgents of the
                        capital, calculated to arouse, exasperate, and madden the people of such
                        city loyal to the Government, were natural enough, even when carried to the
                        extent of unhappy popular outbursts, not easily controlled, and a sad strife
                        illuminated by the flames of conflagration. But in the midst of this
                        condition of popular fury and destruction of property he claims that the
                        agents of the Government were seen on every hand exhorting the people to
                        return to order, to become composed, and suspend those reprisals, dictated
                        evidently by a blind but very excusable spirit of retaliation.</p>
                    <p>He refers, then, to the ultumatum which was presented to him on the evening
                        of the 23d of September by certain representatives of foreign powers, when,
                        as he claims, the Government had the upper hand, and order was being
                        restored. He asserts that the enemies of the Government, quick to take
                        advantage of everything, were pleased to declare that it was foreign
                        pressure which had put an end to the disorders in the streets. But this was
                        untrue.</p>
                    <p>Perfectly advised as to the views of the enemies of his Government, who
                        understood that, left to their forces alone, they would certainly succumb,
                        the President declares that he was occupied during the ten months of the
                        insurrection in striving to prevent the addition of the danger of an
                        international conflict to the embarrassments of civil war. He nevertheless
                        avows that he ought to have protested against the ultumatum in question.</p>
                    <p>But, appealing to the senators and deputies as regards this subject, he calls
                        them to judge whether this ultimatum has, in anything, lowered him in public
                        esteem and consideration, who, in 1879, was, upon their free suffrages,
                        elected to the chief magistracy of the state.</p>
                    <p>Thereupon, after stating that the shocks so violent in the capital of the
                        Republic did not fail to wound every interest there concentered, the
                        President announces that, having put aside the universally-admitted
                        principle that, in the case of a riot or of civil troubles in a state, the
                        interest of foreigners cannot have larger privilege than those of the
                        citizens, he did not await, before making up his mind, the production of
                        foreign reclamations. He claims, then, to have advised the diplomatic corps
                        that he admitted the principle thereof, in settling, apart from the
                        examination to which attention was about to be given, all the anterior acts
                        which had taken place in other localities, and in circumscribing <pb n="310"
                            xml:id="pg_310" facs="0410"/>thereto only, the occurrences which had
                        taken place in Port au Prince the 22d and 23d of September.</p>
                    <p>“You will comprehend,” he adds, addressing the members of the national
                        assembly, “for what purpose I have taken the initiative of such
                        proposition.”</p>
                    <p>He continues, in explanation of his purpose: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Besides the desire which animates me, of which it is necessary to
                                take account in the occurrence, that of tightening more and more the
                                bonds which bind us to the great powers of the globe, I wish in
                                acting so to cut short interventions whose design is disclosed more
                                and more under the impulse of certain enmities. More, I conform
                                myself in this to a recent usage adopted by different nations who
                                have accorded similar indemnities under the name of succor.</p>
                            <p>I have therefore restricted the application to the limits demanded by
                                equity and national interest. No necessary precautions have been
                                neglected to restrain the abuses of which the history of our
                                settlements furnishes such unfortunate precedents, and in this I
                                have been strongly sustained by the excellent spirit of the foreign
                                legations.</p>
                            <p>A commission composed of citizens possessing special fitness as well
                                as exalted honesty, designated naturally according to my choice, has
                                been formed, and my secretary of state has fortified it with precise
                                instructions, which ought to guide it in its labors. England,
                                France, and Germany have named also their commissioners, and already
                                they are at work. The United States, I love to believe, will join
                                soon in this mode of settlement, and we will be able to say then
                                that every subject of conflict had been avoided and that the
                                difficulties approach a favorable solution</p>
                            <p>In the course of this session my secretary of state will furnish you
                                a complete book as to this question of indemnities, in which will be
                                found put together the instructions given to our commissioners,
                                judging without appeal and in the last resort the progress of their
                                labors, their decisions, and all the documents which pertain
                                thereto.</p>
                            <p>In concert with his colleague of finance he will also submit for your
                                approval a project of law intended to indemnify the righful holders
                                thereof.</p>
                            <p>As it will be easy for you to attest from this brief preamble, and as
                                you will see from the exposé of facts which follow, the difficulties
                                created by the insurrection which oppressed the country for ten
                                months, and of which the departments of war and the interior will
                                have to make long communication to you, have been numerous; and
                                nevertheless it can be said that in the course of every negotiation
                                undertaken and followed the <hi rend="italic">ensemble</hi> of our
                                relations with the foreign powers has not been subjected to serious
                                breach.</p>
                            <p>The spirit of equity of the generality of the members of the
                                diplomatic and consular corps, the prudence and wisdom of my
                                Government, have prevented all occasions for conflict which our
                                enemies counted upon already as one of the chances of their success.
                                The reserve which is imposed upon me prevents my indicating to you
                                those of the representatives of friendly powers whose sympathy for
                                the country and loyalty in the exercise of their delicate functions
                                have never belied themselves.</p>
                            <p>It is thus that I would be silent as to the negotiations in progress,
                                the favorable issue which we, of right, await depends upon the
                                secret to observe, the tact of our negotiators, and the justice of
                                our friends.</p>
                            <p>And why doubt with regard thereto when it is their own cause that we
                                plead, when we ask them to investigate the truth with relation to
                                suspicions which have arisen, when we support them by the evident
                                manifestation of certain intrigues from that of interested supports
                                which have no reason to be.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>Comment upon this branch of the President’s exposé is only necessary so far
                        as to state that, as concerns the attitude and power of the Government in
                        connection with the insurrectionary movements occurring in this city on the
                        days named; the responsibility of the Government for property destroyed,
                        certainly that of foreign residents even to the full measure of its value,
                        under the circumstances, and the mode proposed for investigation and
                        determining such value, and providing for its settlement upon some
                        indefinite legislative project hereafter to be proposed, and upon some plan
                        merely of succor, as he suggests; and as regards the apparent indisposition
                        on the part of the Government to assume frankly, and without reserve, its
                        responsibility in the premises with relation to all property destroyed in
                        all parts of the country, the result of revolutionary movements, such as the
                        ones described as taking <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0411"/>place at
                        Port au Prince at the time named, there exists on the part of well informed
                        persons, friends even of his administration, representatives of foreign
                        friendly powers, opinions and judgments entirely at disagreement with the
                        views here expressed by him. But the future will develop such opinions and
                        judgments in their power and truth, for these matters will hereafter be made
                        subjects of serious, sober, wise investigation and decision.</p>
                    <p>The President, in passing, mentions next, with satisfaction, the fact that
                        the interest on the double debt of France has been paid up to April 30,
                        1884; that such debt, now over a half century old, will soon be paid in
                        full, but promises that before that is done the figures thereof shall be
                        carefully examined according to the agreement of 1870.</p>
                    <p>He regrets, on the other hand, that satisfaction has not been given to the
                        holders of the obligations of the loan of 1875, and promises, with regard
                        thereto, that the secretary of state of finances will make provision in
                        which the interests of those concerned shall be duly cared for.</p>
                    <p>Then follow, as translated, certain statements in which we have special
                        interest. He says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Thanks to the activity of our minister plenipotentiary at Washington,
                                to that of our consuls of New York and Philadelphia, and of our
                                eminent judicial advisors, the different processes brought before
                                the Federal courts, on the occasion of armaments made by the
                                insurgents, have terminated to our advantage and to our
                                satisfaction. The ships Tropic, Mary N. Hogan, and Irvin, seized by
                                us, were found culpable, and their owners and crews, convicted of
                                the violation of the laws of neutrality, have been condemned to the
                                pains and penalties provided in such regard.</p>
                            <p>In that which concerns the affairs of Pelletier and Lazare, the
                                loyalty of the American Government, in which we have always had
                                confidence, has contributed with our good disposition with regard to
                                a new examination of such questions to lead to an understanding
                                between the two Governments. These affairs will be settled by
                                arbitration. The arbitrator is a learned and impartial citizen of
                                the United States, and we are able to entertain happy hopes upon the
                                result of such questions, which will not probably be delayed.</p>
                            <p>The affair of Potter has been settled.</p>

                        March 7, 1884, having relation to the mode of settling the claims of
                        American citizens sustaining losses in connection with the insurrectionary
                        events of 22d and 23d days of September, 1883, occurring in this city
                        against this Government, I have the honor to advise you that, after due
                        investigation <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0412"/>and consideration, I
                        have presented for settlement the claims named in my note of the 15th
                        instant, addressed to the honorable secretary of state, Air. St. Victor, a
                        copy of which, with copies of its two inclosures, the first being a
                        memorandum of the several claims, in which is given the names of the various
                        parties and the kind and amount of property destroyed, the second being a
                        memorandum of agreement as to the mode, condition, and terms of their
                        settlement, is herewith inclosed.</p>
                    <p>As showing all the correspondence that has been had by this legation with the
                        Haytien Government on this subject, I have the honor also to transmit, as
                        herewith inclosed, a dispatch, with its translation, addressed to our
                        vice-consul-general, Dr. J. B. Terres, by Mr. St. Victor, during my late
                        absence on the 22d of May last, with a copy of Dr. Terres’s reply thereto on
                        the 23d of the month, and a copy of my own reply thereto on the 28th of
                        June, 1884, from which you will perceive that I do not accede to the
                        proposition of Mr. St. Victor.</p>
                    <p>It will be perceived on reading the dispatch of Mr. St. Victor that, for the
                        reasons named by him therein, he desired to have this legation consent to
                        fix the 22d of this month as the day beyond which no claims additional to
                        any that might already have been presented against his Government could be
                        submitted. He writes, too, as if he had been in correspondence with me as to
                        the organization of a commission to investigate and settle our claims. Such
                        is not the case. His dispatch is of the character of a circular and was, as
                        I have been informed, sent to the diplomatic and consular representatives
                        generally, especially those whose citizens had through them presented their
                        claims for such consideration by commissions as had been agreed. This was
                        the case with the chargé d’affaires of France and the consuls of England and
                        Germany, who early agreed to and did join in the selection of mixed
                        commissions, as they were termed, to which they consented to submit the
                        investigation and settlement of the claims of their citizens upon the
                        instructions of the secretary of state, Mr. St. Victor, as contained in a
                        document, a copy of which I sent to the Department as an inclosure to my
                        dispatch Ho. 638, dated April 14, 1884. The commission is mixed in the sense
                        that the Haytien Government names a certain number, two or three of its
                        citizens, to serve thereon, and the representative of the Government the
                        claims of whose citizens are to be considered names an equal number of his
                        citizens to serve with them. Then the persons thus chosen meet and proceed
                        with their work. According to this arrangement no definite and proper work
                        in the premises can be expected, and without agreeing upon the manner of
                        presenting, investigating, and determining and settling the claims no
                        satisfactory results can be reached. So far, then, as might be expected from
                        the first, the proceedings result in nothing but the hurried consideration
                        of the claims presented, their reduction by a sort of general cutting down
                        one-third, one-half, or more, as the case may be, with no time or mode of
                        payment determined. I have not consented to any such arrangement but have
                        presented our claims, though their aggregated amount be small—$29,188.37—in
                        the manner shown in my communication to the Haytien Government, copies of
                        which are herewith transmitted.</p>
                    <p>So far no reply has been made me by the Haytien Government on this
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>I trust my action may meet your approval, and that I may have your
                        instructions in the premises without delay.</p>

                            that in connection with the insurrectionary movement or events occurring
                            in Port au Prince on the 22d and 23d days of September, 1883, certain
                            citizens of the Government of the United States of America, sustained
                            losses of their property, according to the memorandum thereof herewith
                            submitted to the consideration of your Government for examination and
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>In presenting these claims, Mr. Minister, at this time and in this form,
                            it is to be understood that this is done without prejudice to any like
                            claims of American citizens which may be hereafter presented, and
                            without prejudice to any claims of such citizens which may have grown
                            out of any insurrectionary movements or events occurring in any other
                            part of the Republic of Hayti than Port au Prince anterior or during the
                            year 1883.</p>
                        <p>It is to be equally understood that while it is conceded that in
                            examining and adjusting these claims a consideration of actual and real
                            losses growing out of the events referred to may constitute the rule of
                            such procedure, my Government reserves to itself the right, after full
                            examination, to present diplomatically any claim of one of its citizens,
                            based on the withholding or abuse of any personal rights of such
                            citizens of the United States or indignities to their persons by the
                            officers of the Haytien Government,</p>
                        <p>The undersigned fully advised, Mr. Minister, that it is the desire of
                            your Government to have such claims as these herewith presented
                            submitted for examination and adjustment to a fixed commission upon such
                            terms and conditions as you and myself may agree, upon the approval of
                            our respective Governments, has prepared and now has the honor, most
                            respectfully, to present, as transmitted herewith, a memorandum of
                            agreement which is believed may prove to be satisfactory to you, and as
                            approved by our respective Governments would bring us to a speedy and
                            satisfactory settlement of the claims herewith brought to your

                            an important point on which it is indispensable to-come to an

                            informed of the total and definite amount to be paid in order to prepare

                            your attention that on the 22d and 23d days of September, 1883,
                            especially upon the afternoon of the last day named, the Rev. C. W.
                            Mossell, a citizen of the United States of America, a missionary of the
                            African Methodist Episcopal Church, residing in this city, preaching and
                            teaching school, as a missionary, with his house and home situated on
                            the corner of the streets, Bonne Foi, and Grande-Rue, on the northeast
                            corner thereof, where his wife and family dwelt and where, his school
                            was conducted, was with his wife and family, both upon his own premises,
                            in his house and yard and upon the streets, as he, with his family, was
                            compelled to quit the same to seek refuge and protection in this
                            legation, insulted, threatened, abused, assaulted, and maltreated in the
                            most shameful manner, not only by excited and exasperated persons of the
                            populace, but by members of the police force and officers of your
                            Government whose duty it was to protect Mr. Mossell and his family
                            against every abuse of their personal rights as well as against every
                            indignity. Driven thus from his house and home, insulted and abused, as
                            indicated, his house and all his property and effects utterly destroyed
                            by fire set by the same parties who had insulted and abused him, Mr.
                            Mossell has very properly sought redress in an appeal to his Government.
                            And now, Mr. Minister, the undersigned, in submitting this matter to the
                            attention and consideration of your Government, can not doubt that
                            prompt action will be taken by it in the examination and settlement of
                            this case, in the most liberal manner, as the high sense of honor and
                            justice, which must animate it, would dictate.</p>
                        <p>In suggesting the sum of $60,000, as one measuring, in fact, inadequately
                            the damages suffered and sustained in the abuse of his own personal
                            rights and those of his wife and family, and the indignities shown him
                            and them by the officers of your Government as indicated, the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The following is a statement and a matter
                            of fact, which will inform you of what occurred on the afternoon of the
                            23d of September in and around my house facing La Rue Bonne Foi,
                            Port-au-Prince, Hayti; it will also acquaint you of the acts of violence
                            which were perpetrated on myself and family and those of my
                            household.</p>
                        <p>On the forenoon of said date my house was fired upon, entered and
                            pillaged and burned. This was dona by armed men acting under and obeying
                            the orders of the officers of the Government of Hayti; it was done
                            without the slightest provocation on my part or the part of my
                            household; it was not done ignorantly nor through <pb n="317"
                                xml:id="pg_317" facs="0417"/>mistake; it was not an accident. It was
                            done with intent and purpose, arranged and determined beforehand.</p>
                        <p>It was done with the most perfect knowledge; for example, the officers of
                            the Government and the authorities in general knew that I occupied the
                            house in which I’ was found when the attack was made on my house and
                            property, my family, and my person.</p>
                        <p>They passed by my house the day before and the morning of the 23d, and
                            declared’ to me on their honor that if we remained in the house we would
                            not be injured.</p>
                        <p>Not only did we not provoke the attack, but we did, on the other hand,
                            take all the precaution possible to prevent it. We swung from the
                            balcony the American flag, which still waves from the wall and over the
                            ruins of the house in which we lived, bearing silent testimony to the
                            fact that Americans occupied it.</p>
                        <p>We have already said that our house was entered, we repeat, by soldiers
                            armed, with machetes, guns, revolvers, knives, clubs, and swords; more
                            than one hundred thus armed entered my house; they drew their swords on
                            me; they cocked and pointed their guns at me; they avowed with uplifted
                            hands and dreadful oaths their intentions to kill me; but, thanks be to
                            God, through the intervention of Providence and a man who was well
                            disposed, we made our escape into the street.</p>
                        <p>Three persons, however, before we left the house, were shot in it, viz:
                            Mrs. Pizo, a lady engaged to remain with my wife until after her
                            confinement, and her son, both Spanish subjects; also another little boy
                            about six or eight years old, a British subject, who formerly attended
                            our day school, was shot. He died from the effects the next day. We lost
                            everything, house furniture, school furniture, clothes, provisions,
                            piano, books, jewelry, records, and money.</p>
                        <p>What they did not carry off they destroyed and burned. As we were leaving
                            the house, in the greatest distress, they pulled out of our hands small
                            packages containing valuables. They set the house on fire before it was
                            possible to get out of it, and when we did get out it was with the
                            greatest difficulty we reached the American legation.</p>
                        <p>Myself and my wife, who was expecting every day to be confined, and was
                            confined four days later, were abused and assaulted in the streets; our
                            clothes were torn by the hands of soldiers.</p>
                        <p>The few friendly persons who were doing all they could to protect us gave
                            up in despair and pushed us into a house, where the door was open,
                            saying we can protect you no longer. A few moments after we entered the
                            house the soldiers outside began to fire on it.</p>
                        <p>Seeing and believing that our persons and lives were entirely insecure we
                            resolved; to leave the house into which we had been thrust for
                            protection and try, if possible, to reach the American legation.</p>
                        <p>On our way we were surrounded and followed by soldiers crying for our
                            blood and declaring their intention to kill us. They pushed their
                            revolvers in our faces and drew their machetes ever our persons. Two
                            different times I snatched from my breast the muzzle of the gun
                            violently thrust there by the strong arms of the soldiers of the
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>My wife was dragged and hauled in the streets until her strength failed
                            her, and; on reaching the legation she fell from sheer exhaustion.</p>
                        <p>It is impossible to say at the present moment to what extent both my wife
                            and infant baby have been injured by the terrible deeds perpetrated in
                            my house, and; the ill treatment she received in the streets of
                            Port-au-Prince, the details of which are herein recorded.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: The following is a statement of what
                            I passed through during the 22d and 23d September of this present year,
                            while at my post of duty, and which I now bring to your knowledge.</p>
                        <p>On the 22d, at 11.30 a. m., I found myself on the Bord-Lamer on business
                            of my consulate-general, when I was surprised by the people crying out
                            “take up arms!” Soon as I heard those exclamations pronounced, I took a
                            carriage and hurried to my office. I had not been in the office but a
                            few minutes when you sent Francis requesting of me a flag to protect
                            your private house. At that moment our flag had been already hoisted and
                            the other at my private home for <hi rend="italic">repairs</hi>. When I
                            thought everything was quiet I closed the office and went for the flag
                            which was under repairs to enable me to send you the small one already
                            hoisted in honor of Mr. Black’s death. I made but a few moments’ stay.
                            On my return I saw thirty to forty men of the Government well armed
                            before the consulate door. When they saw me they cried out “Qui Vivi.” I
                            presented the American colors. They made signs for my advance with their
                            hands, and also said so. Soon as I advanced they opened <hi
                                rend="italic">fire</hi> at me and continued about twenty to thirty
                            minutes. Thereupon an acquaintance residing near by called me and
                            offered me his house for my protection. On entering, a shot fired by the
                            Government troops entered the very doorway which I passed. The distance
                            between the Government troops and myself not over 100 yards.</p>
                        <p>Now, my dear Mr. Vice-Consul-General, my life was attempted, and the
                            Stars and Stripes disgracefully insulted by a band of the most loose
                            order of ruffians.</p>
                        <p>I therefore request at your hands a demand requisite both for me
                            personally, and that the United States of America’s colors be
                            saluted.</p>
                        <p>About 3 p.m., seeing the town somewhat quiet, I went out, and on my
                            return to the legation I ascertained my private house and all I
                            possessed were consumed, not forgetting some of the most ancient and
                            valuable family relics.</p>
                        <p>Sunday, September 23. On this day my life was again trifled with, in
                            common words, once more attempted. From 5 o’clock a. m. I was standing
                            at the legation door doing acts of charity and humanity in receiving
                            poor, destitute families whose houses were heaped in ashes and some
                            still in flames. About 1 or 2 o’clock p.m. a band of ruffians and
                            soldiers of the Haytien Government, armed with machetes, small arms,
                            knives, and poignards, stopped before the doorway of the legation. I saw
                            coming from the band our poor citizen, Mr. Mossell, along with his wife,
                            being most shamefully treated. Soon as Mr. Mossell reached within the
                            portals a few ladies, already arrived, were seen by this band of
                            ruffians, who cried out, “There they are,” and spoke about the liberal
                            party, and placing their guns, machetes, &amp;c., to my breast, they
                            positively insisting to pass through the legation. They handled me
                            roughly, I assure you. As a matter of course I made the necessary
                            resistance; otherwise they would have passed even through my body. While
                            this was passing, Mr. Van Bokkelen came to my assistance; at that moment
                            General Herard Laforest presented himself, and at my request dispersed
                            the rebel mob.</p>
                        <p>Very respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>

                            occurring in Port au Prince on the 22d and 23d days of September, 1883,
                            besides having all his property destroyed by fire Mr. Eugene V. Garrido,
                            an American citizen at the time referred to, being the clerk of this
                            legation and consulate-general, a person well known in this city, both
                            as regards his character and position, was insulted, abused, assaulted,
                            and otherwise maltreated by officers of your Government upon the
                            streets, even up to the very doors of this legation, when he narrowly
                            escaped the loss of his life. In bringing this matter to the attention
                            of your Government and asking its due investigation and redress, the
                            undersigned cannot doubt that its distinguished lively sense of justice
                            as well as its profound appreciation of the very great wrong done Mr.
                            Garrido, as indicated, will induce its prompt action in the case,
                            leading it to accord in its conclusion, with respect thereto, the
                            amplest redress and compensation in damages.</p>
                        <p>It would seem in view of all the facts in this case, facts showing so
                            clearly the utter denial of every personal consideration, right, and
                            dignity, even by the officers of the law, as regards Mr. Garrido, that
                            it is within the limits of reasonable equitable demand to name at least
                            $10,000 as the measure of damages.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned, renewing to you, Mr. Minister, his most distinguished
                            consideration, awaits your early convenient reply in the premises.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatch, No. 651, of the 21st of July
                        last, in relation to claims of American citizens against Hayti, for losses
                        suffered in consequence of the events of the 22d and 23d of September, 1883,
                        has been received.</p>
                    <p>Your course in the matter, as disclosed in this dispatch, in pursuance of my
                        instructions of the 7th of March last (No. 265), has been discreet and
                        sagacious, and meets with my approval. You will continue to adhere to that
                        instruction, and press for an early settlement of these small claims,
                        amounting, as they do in all, to less than $30,000.</p>
                    <p>While it is not probable that any other claims of that class will be brought
                        forward by citizens of the United States, you were, nevertheless, right in
                        declining to fix the 22d of July as a limitation to the presentation of such
                        claims.</p>
                    <p>The date of the meeting of the proposed mixed commission, as embodied in the
                        memorandum which was forwarded to you by the Department and which you have
                        laid before Mr. St. Victor, as a limitation of the presentation of such
                        claims, seems both reasonable and just. You will, therefore, adhere to
                        it.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Heretofore, in my dispatch, No. 651, dated
                        July 21, 1884, I have had the honor of transmitting to the Department a copy
                        of my note, with its inclosures, addressed to Mr. B. St. Victor, on the 15th
                        July last, having reference to the mode of settling and paying of the claims
                        of American citizens connected with the events occurring at Port au Prince
                        on the 22d and 23d days of September, 1883. I have now the honor of
                        transmitting, as herewith inclosed, a copy of the reply of Mr. St. Victor
                        thereto dated July 30, 1884, with a copy of its inclosure, with translation
                        of each.</p>
                    <p>It will be perceived that after quite a full statement of what Mr. St. Victor
                        conceives to be the international usage, which justifies his opinion that
                        his Government is not liable, under the circumstances, to our citizens whose
                        property was destroyed, and after stating that he had believed and felt that
                        he had a right to believe that I had accepted the doctrine held by his
                        Government on this subject, and had tacitly accepted the mode of settling
                        such claims proposed by it, he concludes his dispatch by declaring that he
                        cannot treat us as a favored nation, but invites attention to a plan of
                        agreement which constitutes the inclosure of his dispatch. In this plan he
                        provides for a mixed commission composed of six persons, who shall have
                        certain powers and discharge certain duties as therein defined and granted,
                        and whose findings shall be final and binding; and the amounts which they
                        shall award shall be paid in money of Hayti, under some special law to be
                        enacted by the corps legislatif.</p>
                    <p>In my dispatch, a copy of which, dated August 7, 1884, is herewith inclosed
                        and transmitted, I offer three objections to his plan: (1) That the
                        commission may not pass upon the question of the nationality or citizenship
                        of an American claimant; (2) that property destroyed should be estimated and
                        paid for in American money or its equivalent; and (3) that a day fixed and
                        certain should be determined, not exceeding <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321"
                            facs="0421"/>a reasonable time after the publication of the findings of
                        the commission, for the payment of the awards which may be made.</p>
                    <p>Then, as you will see, I reserve the full and entire right of our Government
                        to consider and reject any proposition which his Government may make with
                        respect to any one or all of the points submitted.</p>
                    <p>Hoping that my course may receive your approval in the premises,</p>
                    <p>I have, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge
                            the receipt of your dispatch of the 15th instant, No. 273, under the
                            inclosure of which I received two memoranda which you had prepared, one
                            naming the value of the losses sustained by American citizens during the
                            events at Port au Prince, on the 22d and 23d of September of last year,
                            the other fixing the mode which you propose for the settlement of such
                            indemnities.</p>
                        <p>In this same dispatch you declare, 1st, that such reclamations are
                            submitted without prejudice of other similar ones which may be presented
                            in the future, or of others provoked by insurrectionary movements or
                            events taking place in any other locality of the Republic, before or
                            during the year 1883; 2d, that your Government reserves the right, if it
                            should wish to do so, to employ diplomatic means for all reclamations of
                            its citizens injured in their natural rights or outraged in their person
                            by the Haytien authorities.</p>
                        <p>International law being explicit in a manner clear and precise upon all
                            these points, I confine myself, Mr. Minister, to giving you the
                            assurances that my Government will respect the doctrine and the
                            jurisprudence constantly followed in that regard by all the civilized
                            nations of the globe.</p>
                        <p>Thus it is admitted everywhere that Governments are not responsible for
                            losses and damages sustained by foreigners in case of civil war, since
                            sound reason refuses to admit that there is more protection due them
                            than to citizens of the country, who themselves are exposed to all the
                            perils of similar contingencies.</p>
                        <p>There exists no longer any controversy of the above, and you know as I,
                            Mr. Minister, that a number of Governments have not hesitated for some
                            time to consecrate these principles in their treaties.</p>
                        <p>So one is able to affirm to-day, without provoking any discussion on the
                            proposition, that all the nations of Europe and of America, without
                            exception, reject the indemnity and diplomatic intervention in favor of
                            foreigners for injuries suffered in case of internal dissension.</p>
                        <p>I do not doubt at all that the grand Republic which you represent would
                            not fail in honor to respect on this occasion, a doctrine which one of
                            its Secretaries of State has contributed to establish, to affirm, and to
                            generalize by his just refusal to admit the reclamations of Spain in a
                            riot which took place at New Orleans.</p>
                        <p>As regards the reserve which you make as to certain acts of abuse of
                            authority or of personal outrage, I ought besides to assure you that my
                            Government feels too deeply the sense of duty and justice, not to
                            conform itself strictly in such case to the provisions of international
                            law.</p>
                        <p>I hope, Mr. Minister, that this declaration of principles will give you
                            complete satisfaction, so that we will not have again, for the time, to
                            return to the above, disposed as we shall be to apply it vigorously, in
                            all its parts, when the facts shall be presented for our
                            examination,</p>
                        <p>I come to the occurrences at Port au Prince. You know as well as I do the
                            consideration which led the President of the Republic to act when he
                            recognized by a laudable spontaniety, and without any diplomatic
                            pressure, the principles of indemnities to be accorded to foreigners,
                            victims of such occurrences.</p>
                        <p>He had shown it more than once in his dispatches to the diplomatic and
                            consular corps, as well as in his conferences which had taken place at
                            the same time.</p>
                        <p>It is not, I ought to repeat it here, that the chief of state would
                            recognize the responsibility of Governments in case of civil war, but he
                            has followed on this occasion the example of certain great nations which
                            have been well disposed to accord, under form of succor, indemnities for
                            damages sustained in certain exceptional cases of internal troubles.</p>
                        <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0422"/>
                        <p>It is not then certainly a precedent to be invoked, in the future and in
                            sound logic, this appreciation, as of a case determined, cannot at all
                            influence the doctrine above explained.</p>
                        <p>It is necessary now that I tell you in all candor, Mr. Minister, that I
                            was painfully impressed at the reading of your dispatch of the 15th
                            instant. I had a right to think that after the ten months which have
                            passed since the occurrences at Port au Prince, the correspondence which
                            yon have exchanged with the President of the Republic, the conferences
                            held at the national palace, the acceptance of the bases of a definite
                            settlement by all the powers interested, my circular of instructions to
                            the Haytien commission, whose labors are well nigh determined, I had a
                            right to think, I say, that you had tacitly accepted our mode of
                            procedure whereof you yourself, I believe, had from the first suggested
                            the idea.</p>
                        <p>After the reception of your letter of the 28th of May, I commenced to
                            feel the contrary, and I have been completely disabused in receiving
                            your plan of special agreement for the American indemnities.</p>
                        <p>For my Government would this not be to disregard the rules of
                            international law which establishes equality between the states if it
                            take engagement to settle these indemnities in an exceptional manner,
                            and contrary to all that which has been admitted by Great Britain,
                            France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, and Denmark?</p>
                        <p>If I accept your plan of agreement, without any modification, the
                            Government of these countries, will they not be able to make reproach
                            against mine for having considered the United States as a privileged
                            nation, and would they not in that respect be right, in rejecting this
                            inadmissible procedure, to declare that the labor of the mixed
                            commission upon the eve of being closed, in that which concerns them,
                            are annulled, and to demand that they be recommenced upon conditions of
                            justice and equality?</p>
                        <p>If I am compelled to take into consideration your plan of agreement, I am
                            only able to admit and sign it according to the bases arranged with the
                            other powers.</p>
                        <p>I have then the honor to propose the counter-plan herewith inclosed,
                            which embraces within its limits, and in which are found stated, the
                            principle of law, justice, equality, and reciprocity which cannot be
                            possibly rejected.</p>
                        <p>I will await, Mr. Minister, your new communications on this subject, and
                            I take advantage of this occasion to renew to you the assurances of my
                            high consideration.</p>

                        inclosed, copies of the correspondence which has up to this date passed
                        between this legation and the Haytien Government with regard to the abuse
                        and maltreatment <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0424"/>of Rev. C. W.
                        Mossell, on the 23d day of September, 1883, and his demand therefor.</p>
                    <p>You will find among the inclosures hereof first a copy of the dispatch of
                        Hon. B. Saint Victor, dated July 29, 1884, with its translation, in which he
                        acknowledges the receipt of my dispatch of the 15th ultimo, already
                        transmitted to the Department, and, after regretting that this matter had
                        not at once been brought to the attention of his Government, expresses his
                        willingness to investigate it properly, and do that with respect to
                        reparation in the premises which may be sanctioned by international law.</p>
                    <p>You will find next among the inclosures of this dispatch two dispatches,
                        dated respectively August 7 and 13, 1884, addressed by me, according to
                        their dates, to Mr. St. Victor. In the first I acknowledge the receipt of
                        his dispatch, thank him for the kindly spirit he exhibits with regard to the
                        investigation of the case, remind him that he has already the statement of
                        Mr. Mossell, as presented in my first dispatch, on the subject, but promise
                        that he shall hear from me more fully with respect thereto at an early day.
                        Accordingly, on the 13th instant I write him my second dispatch, in which I
                        set out, in precise and detailed manner, the character and standing of Mr.
                        Mossell and his family; their relations to and Christian benevolent labors
                        for the community 5 their success in the building of a church in Port au
                        Prince and establishing a school; claiming that their loyalty to the present
                        administration of the government and country cannot be denied, nor their
                        presence and influence in Hayti be regarded as any otherwise than desirable
                        and beneficial; and, after stating quite at length the abuse and
                        maltreatment of Mr. Mossell and his family at their home, along the streets,
                        to the very doors of this legation, I refer Mr. St. Victor to persons well
                        known in this city with whom he might confer, should he desire, with
                        reference to the facts of the case as presented.</p>
                    <p>As I have investigated this case, and I have done so with great care, I have
                        been led to regard it in the light of the facts pertaining to it as an
                        aggravated and outrageous affair, for which the Government of Hayti, under
                        the circumstances, should be held to strict and thorough accountability, and
                        generous and liberal reparation.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: You advise me for the first time
                            of your dispatch of the 15th July, No. 274, about ten months after the
                            events took place at Port au Prince, in September of last year, that the
                            Rev. C. W. Mossell, a citizen of the United States of America, had been,
                            with his family, insulted, outraged, assaulted, maltreated on the
                            afternoon of the 23d of September by the irritated populace and the
                            authorities of the place up to the doors of your legation, where he
                            found refuge.</p>
                        <p>I ought to regret, first of all, that this notice should have come so
                            tardily to the Government, being persuaded that an immediate inquiry
                            made the next day after the events would have been more efficacious than
                            that which you demand now.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Minister, I am entirely disposed to occupy myself
                            thereof, for it alone, according to my judgment, is able to establish
                            after an impartial manner the nature, the sum of the damages, and the
                            amount of a just reparation, if there be any to be accorded by
                            international law.</p>
                        <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0425"/>
                        <p>Every amount fixed without such previous examination, resting upon no
                            foundation, appears to me to be arbitrary.</p>
                        <p>The Rev. C. W. Mossell is able, without doubt, to put us in the way to
                            indicate, for example, the persons to question upon the bad treatment of
                            which he complains, to furnish us so the first and principal elements of
                            an inquiry which my Government is ready to prosecute to the end, in
                            order that light may be cast upon the facts which interested passion
                            never ceases to exaggerate in moments of civil troubles which aggravate
                            a country.</p>
                        <p>Before, then, giving you upon the question an opinion, I have the honor
                            to ask you to question the Rev. C. W. Mossell upon the points which I
                            have indicated to you above, and to accept at the same time, Mr.
                            Minister, the assurances, &amp;c.</p>

                            addressed to you on the 7th instant, having reference to the case of
                            Rev. C. W. Mossell, I have the honor, in accordance with my promise, to
                            state further in regard to such case that Mr. Mossell, a Christian
                            Protestant missionary, residing and laboring in the city of Port au
                            Prince and the neighboring country as preacher and teacher for the past
                            eight years, supported entirely by Christian friends, residents of the
                            United States of America interested in him and his work in this country,
                            has, not only by his devoted and laborious earnest missionary life among
                            your people, but by many special patriotic acts of self-sacrifice, shown
                            himself the intelligent and constant friend of the present
                            administration of your Government and the country. A man of sound and
                            general education, of rare christian culture and devotion, he found his
                            desires and aspirations satisfied in his labors, freely and graciously
                            given, even under the most difficult and trying circumstances at times,
                            for the religious and educational elevation and advancement of such of
                            our people and youth as happen to come within the circle of his
                            influence. Thus he found himself laboring in his own house, with his
                            wife, a pious, cultured, devoted, self-sacrificing person, remarkable
                            for her efficiency and success both as a teacher and missionary, when,
                            on the 23d of September, 1883, his home, in which the family of the late
                            honorable Edward Pinckombe, had, at the time, found hospitable, cordial,
                            Christian shelter, was entered again and again, first by officers and
                            soldiers and policemen of your Government, who in rudest manner,
                            demanded to know who was there, searched in every part to find out who
                            was there, and, for the considerate and respectful treatment accorded
                            them by Mr. Mossell and his family, who declared that they were all
                            Americans and friendly and loyal to the Government of the country,
                            insulted, threatened, and maltreated them. And finally when the
                            Pinckombe family, well known to be in Mr. Mossell’s house, had been sent
                            for some three times by officers of the Government and others, and was
                            at last conducted thence by an aid-de-camp of the President, as he
                            stated, in obedience to his orders, such officer refusing in positive
                            and offensive terms protection or aid to Mr. Mossell and his family,
                            even to his wife, at the time in the most delicate, feeble, and helpless
                            condition, though demanded, implored, especially for his wife in the
                            condition indicated, and his child, the house was entered, in the
                            presence and through the influence of officers of your Government, by
                            armed soldiery and police, who abusing and maltreating, as it would seem
                            with renewed <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0426"/>devilish, purpose,
                            Mr. Mossell and his family, not sparing his wife nor his little girl,
                            threatening to shoot and kill them, and to such end using their pistols,
                            guns, and swords in the most frightful barbarous way against the person,
                            the face, the head, and body of Mr. Mossell and in the midst of the
                            family, finally throwing kerosene oil about the floors, stairways,
                            doors, and woodwork of the house, set it on fire and thus with smoke and
                            flames and threats of violence drove Mr. Mossell and his family out of
                            his house, from the gallery of which floated at the time his American
                            flag, into the street, where as he attempted to make his way with his
                            wife, whom he sought specially to protect with his family, to this
                            legation, he and they were still abused, maltreated, threatened,
                            assaulted, by the same parties, even to the very doors of the legation,
                            where Mr. and Mrs. Mossell, after some two hours of desperate struggle
                            over every inch of the way, with their child and other members of their
                            family lost from them, arrived, escaping barely with their lives through
                            the energetic and manly conduct of one or two friends, who were good
                            enough to aid them somewhat on the way, and Mr. Garrido on their
                            arrival.</p>
                        <p>The facts, in this case Mr. Minister, are imperfectly stated by me; the
                            aggravation and torment of the incidents so causeless and outrageous,
                            connected with it, cannot be described.</p>
                        <p>The parties, too, Mr. Minister, to this case are well known both by their
                            good name and labors in this city and country. And when we consider the
                            work which they have already accomplished among your people in the
                            erection of a modest but excellent church structure, situated in the
                            southwestern part of this city; the maintenance and conduct of a large
                            and respectable congregation of orderly worshippers assembling regularly
                            therein; and the establishment and support of a flourishing day-school,
                            numbering at the time of the occurrence of the sad events referred to,
                            quite one hundred pupils, all taught free of charge, and without
                            distinction of any sort, we may not doubt as to their loyalty and
                            devotion to your Government and country, nor as to the value and
                            influence of their presence in your midst.</p>
                        <p>But I do not dwell upon such considerations. Mr. Mossell and his family
                            are American citizens residing in this country, pursuing an honest,
                            orderly manner of life; and instead of abuse, maltreatment, threats,
                            assaults, and outrages, they are entitled to due consideration,
                            respectful considerate treatment and protection certainly from officers,
                            soldiers, and policemen of the Government.</p>
                        <p>The statements made, Mr. Minister, as regards this case are, as you must
                            perceive, susceptible of the easiest confirmation. I have indicated to
                            you herein already sources of information with relation thereto. Mr.
                            Mossell and his family were outraged, as stated, on the afternoon of the
                            23d day of September, 1883, at his house near the corner of Rue
                            Bonne-Foi and Grande-Rue; and as they left there along Rue Bonne-Foi to
                            the house of Mr. Etheart in the Rue du Center, which they entered for a
                            few moments, but in hopeless protection against their pursuers; thence
                            they were forced to return and go up Rue Bonne-Foi to Rue de la Croix,
                            along the last named street to Rue des Miracles, down this street to Rue
                            du Center, and thence to this office; making their way as best they
                            might in the presence of and against a large and formidable concourse of
                            people. The outrage upon them was perpetrated in the presence of a
                            multitude.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Mossell himself, Mrs. Mossell, their friends, Messrs. Thomas M.
                            Brown, George L. Brown, Francois Brown, Miss Y. G. Brown, Mrs. J. Puzo,
                            and Miss Alice Bordie, and Messrs. Van Bokkelen and Garrido, not to name
                            others, who were eye-witnesses of the occurrences mentioned, know all
                            about the insults, abuses, and outrages, experienced as stated by this
                            Christian missionary American family.</p>
                        <p>I hope, now, Mr. Minister, that this case will command the immediate
                            serious and just consideration of your Government, and that its definite
                            just solution and settlement may be concluded without unnecessary
                            delay.</p>
                        <p>Renewing to you. &amp;c.,</p>

                        Victor, dated July 29, 1884, with translation, is herewith inclosed.</p>
                    <p>The honorable secretary expresses in his dispatch, while he signifies his
                        regret that the matter was not sooner brought to his attention, his
                        willingness to give it his earnest and thorough investigation, promising to

                        place and circumstances of the abuse and outrage shown Mr. Garrido,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge
                            the receipt of the dispatch of July 15 last, in which you bring for the
                            first time to the knowledge of the Government, about two months after
                            the events took place at the capital, the 22d and 23d September of last
                            year, that during their occurrence Mr. Eugene V. Garrido, American
                            citizen, secretary of the United States legation, had been insulted,
                            outraged, assaulted, and maltreated by the officers of the Government in
                            the streets, and even to the doors of your legation, where he was able
                            to escape barely with his life.</p>
                        <p>Permit me to express to you first, Mr. Minister, the regret that this
                            information should have reached the Government so tardily, for I am
                            positive that an inquiry had the day after the events would have proved
                            more efficacious than that which you now propose.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, I am entirely disposed to occupy myself with such inquiry
                            which alone, according to my judgment, is able to establish in an
                            impartial manner the nature, the extent of the damages, and the amount
                            of a just reparation, if there be any to accord, according to
                            international law.</p>
                        <p>Any amount fixed, without such prior examination, resting upon no
                            foundation, appears to me to be arbitrary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Eugene V. Garrido is, without doubt, able to put us on the track
                            indicated to us, for instance, the person to be questioned upon the bad
                            treatment of which he complains, furnishing us thus the first and
                            indispensable elements of an inquiry which my Government is interested
                            in prosecuting to the end, in order to throw light upon acts which
                            interested passion never fails to exaggerate in moments of civil
                            troubles which agitate a country.</p>
                        <p>Before giving, then, any opinion on the question which occupies us, I
                            pray you to be good enough and question Mr. Garrido upon the points
                            which I have indicated here above.</p>

                            have already submitted to you, is abundantly capable of the fullest
                            support, since he was maltreated in the public streets, and in the
                            presence of a crowd of witnesses. It will not be difficult, Mr.
                            Minister, for you to find upon due examination that his statements as to
                            his abuse are entirely true.</p>

                            addressed to you on the 7th instant, having reference to abuse and
                            maltreatment of Mr. Eugene V. Garrido, on the 22d and 23d days of
                            September, 1883, I have the honor, for your convenience of investigation
                            with regard thereto, to state with greater particularity and fullness
                            the facts as respects the circumstances of place and time thereof:</p>
                        <p>It was about noon, on the 22d of September, 1883, when Dr. J. B. Terres,
                            vice-consul-general of the United States of America, at that time in
                            charge of this office during my absence, sent to Mr. Garrido, then
                            acting as a clerk in the legation and consulate-general, for a United
                            States flag, for use at his residence. The flag which was to be sent to
                            Dr. Terres was at the time being repaired at Mr. Garrido’s house, in the
                            northern part of the city. Not having a boy at hand to send for it, Mr.
                            Garrido went for it himself. He reached his home, secured the flag, and
                            was returning with it in his hands. When he reached the Rue des
                            Miracles, on his way back to the office, he saw in front of him, a short
                            distance down the rue du Centre, some 30 or 40 well-armed men of the
                            Government, who cried qui vive, at first. When the flag carried by him
                            was presented to them, they beckoned to him to come; he advanced, and
                            they immediately opened fire upon him, following him as he retreated
                            back under the gallery of the house of Mr. S. Rouzier, in the Rue du
                            Centre, and from there still back to the house of Dr. Branch, which he
                            entered, situated upon the southwest corner of Rue du Centre and Bourse
                            Foi. In this house, through the kindness of its occupant, Mr. Garrido
                            was obliged to remain for a long time sheltered against these soldiers,
                            who, firing thereupon as he entered, came near overtaking him and his
                            rescuer by their shot; in fact, Dr. Branch was slightly wounded. Mr.
                            Garrido must have been well known to the persons who made such
                            demonstrations of violence and outrage against him, and it requires the
                            largest possible degree of charity to imagine that they did not know his
                            position in connection with this office.</p>
                        <p>But on the 23d day of the same month, as Mr. Garrido was engaged at the
                            door of this legation in the performance of duties which properly enough
                            commanded his attention under the circumstances, he was, between 1 and 2
                            o’clock in the afternoon, again maltreated and abused, being insulted
                            and roughly handled by a crowd of soldiers, from whose violence he was
                            finally saved through the good offices of Mr. C. A. Van Bokkelen, who
                            called General Herard Laforest, who happened to be passing at the time,
                            and who, with the greatest and most violent exertions, dispersed the
                            crowd.</p>
                        <p>The facts as here detailed, Mr. Minister, sustained by the solemn
                            declaration of Mr. Garrido himself, supported by the statement of many
                            others, are not difficult of comprehension, are easily substantiated,
                            and support in the clearest manner the demand which I have had the honor
                            to make already in his behalf. I trust this case may now command, Mr.
                            Minister, your immediate consideration and its solution and settlement
                            be determined at a very early day.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. W. K. Yan Bokkelen, father of Mr. G. A.
                        Yan Bokkelen, whose arrest and imprisonment at Port au Prince for debt has
                        been the subject of recent correspondence with your legation, naturally
                        shows the greatest solicitude for his son, and frequently addresses the
                        Department in his behalf, while your No. 647 of July 7 last, in giving a
                        detailed statement of the case, said that Mr. Yan Bokkelen’s health was not
                        very good, and that in consequence thereof you had succeeded in having him
                        removed from the jail to the military hospital.</p>
                    <p>I am constrained, therefore, to inquire whether the appeal foreshadowed in
                        your No. 647 has been taken, and, if so, whether the decision of the court
                        of cassation has been rendered. If not, and Mr. Yan Bokkelen is still in
                        confinement, you will take every proper step to obtain his immediate
                        release.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit, as herewith
                        inclosed, with its translation, severally, a copy of the law, proposed by
                        the President and passed, on the 3d instant, by the Legislative Assembly of
                        Hayti, with regard to the settlement of the indemnities connected with
                        events of the 22d and 23d days of September, 1883, at Port au Prince, as
                        published in the official section of Le Moniteur of Saturday, October 18,
                        1884.</p>
                    <p>This law recognizes a debt against the state for the payment of indemnities,
                        as therein prescribed, amounting to $588,418.</p>
                    <p>This sum is to be paid upon coupons of indemnity commencing with November 30
                        next, when $98,069.16 shall be paid; and thereafter on September 30 of each
                        year, 1886, 1887, 1888, 1889, and 1890, one-sixth of the amount remaining
                        shall be paid.</p>
                    <p>The amount is to be raised, as provided, by a surtax of 10 per cent, on
                        exports, which is to be collected according to existing laws. Any annual
                        surplus shall be carried to following year, to be employed for the purpose
                        named, or to pay the claims of any persons whose right has not yet been
                        determined.</p>
                    <p>It is provided in the last two articles of the law that the reports of the
                        commissions, the documents and the diplomatic correspondence pertaining to
                        the claims shall be published, and that its provisions shall be executed by
                        the secretary of state of foreign relations and of finances as regards that
                        which concerns the one and the other.</p>
                    <p>It will be perceived from article 1st of the law that the indemnities
                        specifically mentioned as having been verified and admitted are the English,
                        German, Belgian, Danish, French, and Spanish.</p>
                    <p>Ours have not as yet been settled, as up to this time I have refused to <pb
                            n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0430"/>accept the terms of settlement
                        offered by the Haytien Government. It has been stated to me, however, by the
                        secretary of state of foreign relations that the appropriation is ample to
                        include our claims when settled as his Government proposes.</p>
                    <p>It has been stated also that the representatives, diplomatic and consular, of
                        the several nations mentioned in the law, are not willing to accept the
                        settlement as far as the term of six years for the payment of the indemnity
                        is concerned. In fact, the gentleman who is at present representing the
                        English Government has made written formal protest against it. I await the
                        result thereof, and in the mean time I shall insist upon the settlement and
                        payment of our claims in the manner heretofore demanded of this Government,
                        and of which I have fully advised you.</p>

                        reference to the reclamations and claims of American citizens connected with
                        the occurrences of the 22d and 23d days of September, 1883.</p>
                    <p>In his dispatch the honorable secretary of state mentions the fact,
                        incidentally, that we have had two conferences at the national palace in the
                        presence of the President, in which the reclamations and claims referred to
                        constituted the subject of debate. He forgets to state, however, that I
                        consented to such conferences, and in the presence of the President, in view
                        of the declaration of such high functionary, that he very much desired to
                        settle all the matters in difference between us amicably, if possible, but
                        especially the reclamations of Messrs. Mossell and Garrido. It was to test
                        the sincerity of such profession that I did offer to settle the claim of the
                        last-named person for $5,000 in cash, and that of Mr. Mossell for $25,000 in
                        cash, a perpetual annuity of $200 per month, for his school-church
                        (Protestant) located in this city, and the release of the man whom he
                        supposed to be a political prisoner, who served his family so signally on
                        the 23d of September, 1883, by taking care of and saving his little
                        daughter.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>You will perceive that the secretary advises me in his dispatch that he
                        proposes to institute a special commission for the investigation of the
                        cases of Messrs. Mossell and Garrido, and promises to let me have notice of
                        the time to be hereafter fixed for its meeting. He hopes thus <pb n="332"
                            xml:id="pg_332" facs="0432"/>to find the facts of the cases so as to be
                        able in the light thereof to determine the amount which his Government ought
                        to pay.</p>
                    <p>Thereafter he passes to the discussion of the three points of difference
                        between us, as regards the money in which estimates and payments shall be
                        made of the claims of our citizens for their property destroyed, the time
                        when the payments, shall be made, and that it shall be determined by the
                        Corps Legislatif of his Government; and finally of the mode of determining
                        the nationality or citizenship of a claimant, he holding that, as shown in
                        connection with mixed commissions constituted by our own with other
                        Governments named, the commission is alone competent to determine such
                        question. He does, however, at last, as it would seem, agree to discuss with
                        me and determine, before any of the claims be presented to the commission
                        which may be constituted, any question that may present itself having
                        reference to the nationality of any one or all of the claimants.</p>
                    <p>The ease with which the secretary passes over the matter of time of paying
                        any amount which may be found due one or all of our citizens, claimant or
                        claimants, might lead one to think that that was not one of the points upon
                        which I do and shall insist with vigor and decision. The Corps Legislatif
                        has no right after this Government has destroyed an American citizen’s
                        property to put the day of paying therefor off beyond a time which is
                        reasonable and just.</p>
                    <p>I have deemed it wise to transmit this dispatch to the Department, covering,
                        as it does in its way, and from the Haytien standpoint, all the matters of
                        law and equity claimed by this Government to effect the questions in debate
                        by this legation with the department of state of foreign relations, and ask
                        the final and full instructions of the Department with regard thereto.</p>
                    <p>Of course, the Department will perceive that this legation labors under some
                        little embarrassment by reason of the fact that it appears that other
                        Governments represented near this, other than our own, have consented to the
                        mode of settling the claims under consideration proposed by this Government.
                        I await, therefore, any early additional instructions which, in view of the
                        positions taken in this dispatch, the Department may be pleased to give.</p>
                    <p>I have also the honor to transmit, as herewith inclosed, my note, dated to
                        day, addressed to Mr. St. Victor, in which I acknowledge the receipt of his
                        dispatch, and while I insist upon his acceptance of the memorandum which I
                        submitted, on the 15th of July last, to his Government as constituting a
                        just basis upon which to examine and settle our claims and reserve all the
                        rights and interests that pertain to our citizens, both as regards their
                        claims and reclamations, demanding their immediate settlement, I advise him
                        that I shall bring his dispatch in communication to your attention.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>. I was about to reply to your two
                            dispatches of the 23d of September, Nos. 294 and 296, when it was agreed
                            between us that we would attempt by verbal conferences to arrive at a
                            definite understanding upon the points which divided us <pb n="333"
                                xml:id="pg_333" facs="0433"/>relative to the Mossell and Garrido
                            reclamations and to those of American citizens in general connected with
                            the events at Port au Prince last year.</p>
                        <p>Our first conference took place at the national palace in presence of His
                            Excellency the President of the Republic, and I had right to hope that a
                            second would place us in complete accord.</p>
                        <p>I have the regret to witness that it has not done so.</p>
                        <p>In fact, Mr. Minister, in this second conference, after we had occupied
                            ourselves with the different reclamations upon which I shall have to
                            revert with you in other dispatches, we were occupied with those of
                            Messrs. Mossell and Garrido.</p>
                        <p>You remember that in the purpose of my Government they ought to form the
                            object of a special inquiry which should verify the correctness of the
                            complaints of Messrs. Mossell and Garrido, in order to establish in an
                            impartial manner the amount of the indemnity to be accorded them, such
                            being the case.</p>
                        <p>In our interview you consented to reduce by one-half the figure of
                            $10,000, which previously you had demanded for Mr. Garrido, and in that
                            which concerns Mr. Mossell you brought his first figures from $60,000 to
                            $25,000, provided that the Government would engage itself to allow him a
                            monthly sum of $200 as a subvention of a Protestant school which he
                            would establish at Port au Prince, and would liberate upon his demand a
                            person detained in the prison of this city, whom he should
                            designate.</p>
                        <p>I have not deemed it necessary to dwell upon this proposition which
                            seemed to confer upon Mr. Mossell one of the highest governmental
                            attributes, and whereof the chief of state himself is only in part
                            possessed.</p>
                        <p>I confirm to you then, Mr. Minister, that my Government is disposed to
                            pursue the projected inquiry, and I pray you to to inform Mr. Mossell
                            and Mr. Garrido, who will be called at the proper time by the
                            examiners.</p>
                        <p>I will have the honor to advise you of such time.</p>
                        <p>Permit me to hope that in view of their report our two Governments will
                            be able to regulate the question after a manner just and equitable.</p>
                        <p>Relatively to the reclamations generally of American citizens, with
                            respect to the events at Port au Prince of last year, you told me in
                            this second conference that in view of the smallness of your figure,
                            very inferior to that France, amounting to $400,000, I ought to accept
                            without discussion your first memorandum.</p>
                        <p>I would pray you to remark, Mr. Minister, that the examination of all
                            similar reclamations to those which occupy us had been confined to mixed
                            commissions upon basis assuredly less advantageous than those which I
                            have had the honor to propose to you. In all of these questions of
                            equity and justice they had there was made abstraction of the number and
                            of the amount of the reclamations.</p>
                        <p>Thus, although the Spanish claimants have obtained only $7,850; the
                            Belgian, $3,056; the Danish, $1,160.75; procedure was had with them in
                            the same manner for the French, to whom there has been allowed
                            $413,399.50; the English, $87,403; and the Germans, $77,350.</p>
                        <p>All these reclamations passed through the same formalities.</p>
                        <p>If certain figures are higher than others, it is evidently in consequence
                            of the number of the claimants and of the extent of the damages
                            attested.</p>
                        <p>In the second analysis you have added, Mr. Minister, that for the reasons
                            which you express, you could not change in any respect your memorandum
                            of the 15th of July.</p>
                        <p>That was exactly that which you wrote me the 23d of September (dispatch
                            No. 296).</p>
                        <p>I had always thought, nevertheless, and I continue to be of the same mind
                            since our correspondence establishes it fully, that you had agreed with
                            me upon <hi rend="italic">the counter-project which I have had the honor
                                to submit to you</hi>, except upon the three points which follow: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Denomination of the money in which the indemnities are to be
                                    adjudged.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The time of payment.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Establishment of the nationality of the claimants.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>It does appear to me necessary to determine this point of departure, upon
                            which I desire to be informed in a precise and definite manner.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless it is my duty to remark to you that the fixing of the term
                            of payment pertains exclusively to the powers of our Corps Legislatif,
                            and that it does not pertain to me to trespass upon its rights.</p>
                        <p>I believe besides that the denomination of the money of the indemnities
                            to be adjudged ought not to be made the object of discussion between
                            us.</p>
                        <p>You demand American money or “its equivalent.”</p>
                        <p>So that one determining the indemnities in American money, or its
                            equivalent, attains exactly the same results.</p>
                        <p>In that which concerns the nationality, since you do not desire to leave
                            the determination thereof to the mixed commission, I have admitted that
                            the two Governments <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0434"/>interested
                            should occupy themselves thereof before the presentation of all the
                            reclamations.</p>
                        <p>In this regard I remind you of my dispatch of the 18th of September, in
                            which a modification to my counter project is found presented.</p>
                        <p>This modification I have thought would be accepted without discussion,
                            for it constitutes, without doubt, a privilege; since the other
                            commissions have had to pronounce themselves upon the nationality of the
                            claimants.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, persuaded that in invoking the facts drawn from the doings of
                            mixed commissions which have sat since fifteen years at Washington, I
                            would have arrived with you in a definite understanding, I have had the
                            honor to present to you a note in which I have shown that all these
                            commissions have had the exclusive right of interpreting the text of the
                            treaty or of the protocol which constituted them and to decide if they
                            had jurisdiction of the claimant, with regard to his nationality or upon
                            the subject of the reclamation.</p>
                        <p>Thus the two first questions proposed have always been these: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The commissioners, have they jurisdiction of the
                                    claimant?</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Have they jurisdiction of the subject of the
                                    reclamation?</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Permit me to repeat to you, Mr. Minister, that from the commencement of
                            the doings of the Franco-American Commission, the United States have
                            submitted these questions, have even demanded of the claimant to prove
                            that he had not lost his quality of Frenchman, in repelling every
                            diplomatic action whatever upon the subject. Two hundred French
                            claimants were defeated by the commission either because they had not
                            made choice in view of the treaty of Frankfort, made between France and
                            Germany, or because they had formed in the United States establishments
                            without the purpose of return, or voted in the general elections.</p>
                        <p>It stands proved that the question of personal status of the claimant has
                            always been the first discussed in these cases, and one can without
                            hesitation give to it the form following:</p>
                        <p>The claimant, is he a citizen or subject of the country of which he
                            claims nationality and protection?</p>
                        <p>It is this which is incumbent upon him to prove legally before the
                            commission which ought to take cognizance of his reclamation.</p>
                        <p>It is then the desire only of my Government to arrive at a settlement of
                            American reclamations, which has caused it to take from the
                            Americo-Haytien Commission a right established by the United States
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>The good will which you have always shown for our young Republic gives me
                            the hope that our Government will not have to address itself to the
                            Cabinet at Washington for the solution of those questions which it had
                            been able to settle here without difficulty with the representatives of
                            other foreign powers.</p>
                        <p>In closing, I desire to express to you the regret that I experience in
                            not being able to separate, as you have asked of me, the different parts
                            of this dispatch. They are bound together closely, and have been the
                            object of two conferences which I desired to speak of in their
                            entirety.</p>

                        last, accompanied by a copy of a law recently passed by the Legislative
                        Assembly of Hayti, appropriating $588,418 to pay claims against that
                        Republic on account of the riots of September 22 and 23, 1883, at Port au
                        Prince. You add that no provision has been made in this sum to compensate
                        American citizens for their losses on that occasion, and say that the
                        proposed method of liquidating those claims covered by that appropriation
                        has been the subject of a formal protest by the representative of Great
                        Britain. The result of this you are awaiting with interest, and meanwhile
                        you declare your intention to insist upon the payment of all American claims
                        in the manner heretofore demanded by this Government.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I herewith transmit a copy of a letter from
                        Mr. William A. Van Bokkelen, of the 15th instant, stating that according to
                        his latest advices from Hayti, his son, Mr. C. A. Van Bokkelen, was still
                        confined in prison where he was placed September 19 last, fox having made an
                        assignment of his property, and asking that you bring the matter urgently to
                        the attention of the President of Hayti, and demand the immediate release of
                        Mr. C. A. Van Bokkelen. It will be observed that the writer states that the
                        time has expired when, under the law, those having the right to raise
                        objection to the assignment should have done so, and that no objection
                        whatever was made.</p>
                    <p>The Department has no reason to expect that you will omit any proper step to
                        aid Mr. Van Bokkelen, whose imprisonment, under all the circumstances of his
                        case, appears unduly harsh. It is desired, therefore, that you will continue
                        every proper effort in his behalf looking to his release.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: I last addressed you on the
                            subject of my son’s arbitrary arrest and confinement at Port au Prince,
                            on the 19th September. Since then I have advices from Port au Prince of
                            date November 1. It appears that on October 21, the <pb n="336"
                                xml:id="pg_336" facs="0436"/>time (for parties interested in the
                            assignment made by my son, and who had the right under the law to make
                            objections to such assignment) expired and no objections were made by
                            any one, not even by the parties upon whose application the illegal
                            arrest and confinement was made, they refusing to claim that a right of
                            arrest existed against an American citizen, which by the laws of the
                            country secure Haytiens from an arrest in similar cases.</p>
                        <p>On September 27, our minister had occupied himself with the minister of
                            foreign affairs and of justice in the case, but finds great opposition
                            made by them as they have already taken the stand that an American
                            citizen is not entitled to the same privilege as an Haytien.</p>
                        <p>I also learn that as the last resort our minister has addressed himself
                            to the President of Hayti, who if he follows in the footsteps of his
                            predecessors will sustain the action of his ministers, and like
                            Dominique in the canal matter only yield at the presence of a
                            man-of-war, or the knowledge of the fact that one is to leave to enforce
                            the rights of our citizens.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time he is confined in a hospital amongst incurable, liable
                            at any time to be returned to the vile prison, from which through the
                            kindness of Mr. Langston he was removed.</p>
                        <p>The case resolves itself into these simple facts. By the laws of Hayti,
                            Haytians are allowed to make an assignment of all their property to pay
                            debts when they find themselves from honest losses unable to liquidate
                            in full all claims against them. The law says distinctly and clearly
                            that the benefit allowed of non-arrest and confinement is a privilege
                            accorded to persons of good faith allowing them their liberty, but not
                            releasing them from their indebtedness.</p>
                        <p>Now, having been illegally arrested and confined, my son is by the
                            highest tribunal refused his restoration to liberty solely on the ground
                            that being an American citizen the law does not give him the rights
                            accorded an Haytien.</p>
                        <p>Having every reason to believe from your letters and conversation with
                            Mr. Langston, that no doubt exists that by virtue of articles 6 and 9 of
                            our treaty an American is entitled to the same rights of an Haytien, I
                            most earnestly ask that our minister be instructed to at once bring the
                            matter to the attention of the President of Hayti and not only demand
                            but see that my son is at once given his liberty, and due and prompt
                            reparation made for non-fulfillment of treaty obligations in thus
                            insulting through its citizen the American Government, and that my son
                            be indemnified for loss of business, health, and otherwise.</p>
                        <p>I have not called in the aid of other parties, wholly relying on the
                            Department; I can refer you to Mr. Nathaniel Niles, of Madison, N. J.,
                            and others if necessary.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to inclose herewith for your
                        information copies of communications addressed to the President from the
                        Hon. J. B. Beck, United States Senator from Kentucky, his excellency
                        Governor Knott, of Kentucky, and the Hon. S. B. Berry, also of Kentucky,
                        requesting that steps be taken to obtain permission from the Italian
                        Government for the Reverend Father Valentine Theodore Lanciotti, a native of
                        Ciciliano, Italy, to visit his aged father, who still resides at that
                        place.</p>
                    <p>It appears that the reverend father, after being called upon to perform
                        military service in the Italian army, secretly left Italy in 1870 for the
                        United States, and has since become a citizen of this country.</p>
                    <p>He very naturally anticipates trouble upon his contemplated visit to Italy,
                        and has, through his friends in Kentucky where he is engaged as
                        vice-president of St. Mary’s College, requested the President to intervene
                            <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0437"/>with the Italian Government and
                        request that he be permitted to visit his native land unmolested.</p>
                    <p>It is represented that Biagio Lanciotti, the father of the applicant, is now
                        eighty years of age, and is anxious to see his son in order to arrange his
                        worldly affairs.</p>
                    <p>It is also represented that Biagio Lanciotti furnished the Italian army with
                        a son who performed the services due from the reverend father.</p>

                            Ky., and from Governor Knott and myself, which I would be much obliged
                            if you would lay before the President and give us such aid in obtaining
                            favorable action from him as you consistently can.</p>

                            directly to the President, first because I wanted your advice and
                            assistance, not knowing what power the President has in regard to such
                            matters, and thinking that he as well as myself might need your advice
                            as to what could be done and bow to do it. Secondly, I did not know
                            whether the President was in Washington, and as the matter required
                            action through the State Department I thought it would more certainly be
                            attended through you than any one else.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Your Excellency</hi>: As a kindness to my friend and
                            former preceptor, I beg leave to submit the following to your Excellency
                            for consideration:</p>
                        <p>Valentine Theodore Lanciotti, a native of Ciciliano, near Tivoli, Italy,
                            left his country and came to Marion County, Kentucky, where he now
                            resides. He left Italy in 1870, being then eighteen years of age, and
                            his absenting himself was necessary to the accomplishment of his purpose
                            in life. He had been designed by his parents for the priesthood in the
                            Roman Catholic Church, and his studies up to that time were so
                            directed.</p>
                        <p>Early in 1870 he was called upon by the Italian army to enter its ranks.
                            As this would forever defeat his ambition to be a priest, he secretly
                            left his country and came here, and is now (having taken all legal
                            steps) a citizen of the United States. Once safe under our protection he
                            pursued his studies and became a priest, and is now the efficient
                            vice-president of St. Mary’s College, Marion County, Kentucky, an
                            institution of learning of great value in this section. That he might be
                            better described to the Italian Government, I will say he is the son of
                            Biagio Lanciotti, of Ciciliano, Italy. Mr. Lanciotti furnished the army
                            of Italy with a son who took the place of Valentine.</p>
                        <p>This is his history in brief. Now comes his petition to your Excellency.
                            His father is now old (being nearly eighty) and very anxious to see his
                            priest boy again; besides he wants his son at home for a short time to
                            arrange his few worldly goods before his death. Father Valentine has
                            applied to the Secretary of State for information as to his safety in
                            visiting Italy, and is informed, and correctly so, too, that the United
                            States can give him no protection should he be molested in Italy. He
                            therefore humbly asks your Excellency, <hi rend="italic">if it be proper
                                for you to do so</hi>, to request, through your Secretary of State,
                            and through the Italian minister of the King of Italy, that he be
                            allowed to visit his home for a few months this fall, hoping to be in
                            Rome by the middle of September. If the Italian Government will send him
                            letters of protection in this matter he will sail immediately; if not he
                            must forever remain away. Your Excellency will observe from the
                            prominent support Father Valentine is receiving before your Excellency
                            that he is no criminal either of high or low degree, but simply the
                            favorite son of an humble Italian farmer. He has been long and favorably
                            known by Hon. J. Proctor Knott, our governor, who incloses a letter in
                            this to your Excellency. <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0439"
                            />Messrs. Beck and Williams, to whom I am personally known, together
                            with. Messrs. Clay, Thompson, Robertson, of the lower house of Congress
                            from Kentucky, will testify to my honesty in the matter; and all things
                            considered I am strongly in hopes that your Excellency will grant this
                            favor to the reverend gentleman, because it is the only solution to the
                            difficulty. He would not trouble you in your many duties if the matter
                            could be attended to or the object accomplished otherwise.</p>
                        <p>I know you will be willing to do all in your power, under the
                            circumstances, consistent with your own personal dignity and that of the
                            liberty-loving country over which you rule.</p>

                        <p>I know Father Lanciotti intimately, and can commend him as a most
                            excellent and exemplary gentleman, if, indeed, his position as second

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: I received the note of the 16th
                            August last that this legation of the United States has done me the
                            honor of addressing to me in order to obtain that the Rev. Valentine
                            Teodoro Lanciotti, born at Ciciliano (Rome) and now a naturalized
                            citizen of the United States, might come to Italy to attend to his
                            affairs without any molestation, although he has failed to render
                            military service.</p>
                        <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0440"/>
                        <p>I have immediately communicated the subject of the note to my colleague,
                            the minister of war, who has replied to me that it is not possible to
                            grant any authorization to this effect, because the fact of having
                            become a citizen of the United States does not exempt Mr. Lanciotti from
                            the obligations that he has towards the military laws of Italy, and for
                            not having complied with them, returning to his native country he cannot
                            be treated otherwise than as one who has willfully failed to perform
                            military duty. (Art. 12, <hi rend="italic">C. Civile.</hi>)</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Lanciotti may return to Italy without being molested,
                            in case only that he means to make his position regular in regard to the
                            conscription. To this end it would be necessary for him to procure from
                            the consul of the place where he resides, and if there is none there
                            from the nearer consulate, a special paper for Italy. On his arrival in
                            Italy he should present himself to the military authority, and after the
                            visit he will be by the same authority referred for trial to the
                            judiciary authority that has the power to judge him. Before this
                            authority he will be able to bring forth all those reasons that he shall
                            deem useful to obtain a diminution of the penalty, or acquittal. After
                            the judgment, if absolved, or after having undergone the punishment if
                            condemned, Mr. Lanciotti must present himself to the recruiting board,
                            and if found able for military service, he will be enrolled according to
                            article 160 of the laws of enrollment.</p>
                        <p>I regret, Mr. Minister, not to be able to give a more favorable reply to
                            the note of this legation, but the military laws are very severe and
                            admit no exception whatever.</p>
                        <p>I avail, &amp;c.,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring you to your dispatch No. 361,
                        January 31, 1883 to my dispatch No. 583, March 6, 1883, and the inclosure
                        therein, all relating to the schooner Daylight, sunk in the harbor of
                        Tampico by the Mexican gunboat Independencia, and the claim for damages
                        resulting therefrom, I have to inform you that on the 11th of April last, in
                        obedience to instructions contained in your No. 382, March 24 last, I
                        addressed a note to Señor Mariscal, in which I asked further information on
                        the subject discussed by him in his reply to my note of the 15th February
                        last, a copy of which is inclosed in my No. 583.</p>
                    <p>On the 14th August last, not having received an answer thereto, I addressed a
                        note to Señor Fernandez asking for one. This answer I have this day
                        received, dated the 18th instant. A copy and translation thereof I
                        inclose.</p>
                    <p>Señor Fernandez recalls to me that the principle has been invariably
                        maintained by the Mexican department for foreign affairs that diplomatic
                        intervention on behalf of foreigners is not admitted except in cases where
                        there has been a denial of justice. He says that the case of the Daylight
                        is, primarily, one of the competence of the department of war and marine,
                        before which the parties in interest should present their claim, taking
                        occasion to inform me that before that department the claim cannot be
                        presented through this legation, as foreign ministers can only address the
                        Government to which they are accredited through the department of foreign
                        affairs. If that department, he says, does not admit the responsibility of
                        the Government in the premises, <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0441"
                        />they have their recourse in the courts. He finds authority for this in
                        article 8 of the federal constitution, which provides: “Es inviolable el
                        derectio de peticion ejercido por escrito, de una manera pacifica y
                        respetuosa.” (The right of petition by writing, couched in peaceable and
                        respectful terms, shall be inviolable.) And as the succeeding phrase in the
                        article above quoted from qualifies the above right, as follows, “pero en
                        materias politicas solo pueden ejerculo los ciudadanos de la Republica” (but
                        in political affairs this right can only be exercised by citizens of the
                        Republic), he assumes that foreigners may bring the Mexican Government into
                        court; in other words, that the right of petition for a redress of
                        grievances includes the right to sue a nation in its own courts.</p>
                    <p>The question which I propounded to him, as suggested in your dispatch No.
                        382, viz, whether an individual has the power, in Mexico, to proceed at law
                        against a national vessel of war for damages inflicted upon him, he does not
                        consider it necessary to discuss, as he finds an answer thereto in article
                        97 of the constitution, which confers jurisdiction on the Federal courts,
                        “De las que versen sobre directio maritimo” (small cases arising under
                        maritime law).</p>
                    <p>Therefore, according to Señor Fernandez, because cases arising under maritime
                        law come under the jurisdiction of the Mexican federal courts, a national
                        vessel may be brought into court to respond for damages inflicted by
                        her.</p>
                    <p>From his note it results, first, that a claim for the reparation of damages
                        caused to a citizen of the United States by the running down of his vessel
                        by a Mexican man-of-war, in a Mexican port, must be first presented for
                        adjustment to the department of war and marine; second, in case the decision
                        of that department is adverse to him, he must appeal to the courts of the
                        country for redress; and, third, that diplomatic intervention in his behalf
                        is not to be admitted except in the case of a denial of justice.</p>

                            and your excellency’s note to me of the 3d March, relating to the claim
                            for compensation presented against your excellency’s Government by the
                            owners of the American schooner Daylight, for the sinking of that vessel
                            in the port of Tampico by the Mexican gunboat Independencia.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency declined, as you will remember, to consider the claim on
                            two grounds— <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>Because if the captain of the schooner thinks that the
                                    responsibility of the collision rests upon the Mexican
                                    Government, he should apply directly to the department of war
                                    and marine for redress.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>If that department denies its responsibility, you (I) know
                                    that in cases of maritime disaster, giving rise to controversies
                                    between parties, it is for the tribunals of the country having
                                    jurisdiction over the waters where the disaster occurred to
                                    declare whether the disaster occurred through neglect or not,
                                    and upon whom the responsibility falls, and therefore the claim
                                    cannot, at the present stage thereof, be considered
                                    diplomatically.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>My Government is. at a loss to understand the first point assumed by your
                            excellency, as, by the custom of nations, a complaint of an alien, when
                            not cognizable by the courts of law, can only be presented in the mode
                            recognized by diplomatic usage, <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0442"
                            />through the proper officers of his own Government, and he is not
                            permitted to appeal directly to any of the political departments of the
                            Government against whom the complaint is made.</p>
                        <p>The propriety and the reasons for this course are so apparent and are so
                            well known to your excellency that my Government presumes that there is
                            some peculiar feature in the administrative powers of the Mexican
                            department of war and marine of which my Government is ignorant which
                            caused your excellency’s suggestion, which, on its face, does not seem
                            to be in harmony with diplomatic usage and precedents.</p>
                        <p>If your excellency’s second point is intended to intimate that an alien
                            may proceed in the courts of Mexico against a national vessel in the
                            usual form prescribed for suits against private vessels owned by
                            individuals, not used for the national protection but in the peaceful
                            operations of commerce, my Government may be disposed to concede that
                            the owner of the Daylight must in this, as in other cases of collision,
                            first exhaust his judicial remedy, after which the case might, or might
                            not, become a proper one for diplomatic representations. My Government,
                            however, considers that your excellency’s statement is not so explicit
                            as to leave the subject entirely without doubt, and as such a power in
                            an individual to proceed at law against a national vessel of war does
                            not exist in the United States, nor, so far as is known, elsewhere,
                            unless in Mexico, my Government would be glad to receive further
                            information on the subject, and this information I have been instructed

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: Your excellency’s note of the
                            11th April, in reply to one addressed to you by Señor Mariscal on the 3d
                            of March, with reference to the reclamation made by the owners of the
                            American schooner Daylight, who allege that said vessel was run down in
                            the port of Tampico by the Mexican gunboat Independencia, was duly
                            received by this department.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency’s note of the 14th of August upon the same subject has
                            been also received. Your excellency is pleased to observe, in the first
                            place, that a foreigner has no recourse to any of the political
                            departments of the Government for the presenting of a claim which is not
                            of the competence of the tribunals of justice, except through the medium
                            of the Government of which the foreigner is a citizen, and that there
                            does not exist in the United States, or in any other country that you
                            are aware of, the right in an individual to proceed judicially against a
                            national vessel; for which reason your excellency’s Government desires
                            further information upon these points.</p>
                        <p>Complying with your request I proceed to make such additions as are by
                            this department considered pertinent in confirmation of the decision
                            which it has heretofore announced to your excellency in the case.</p>
                        <p>In respect of the first observation, your excellency will permit me to
                            recall to you the principle which has been invariably maintained by this
                            department, that diplomatic intervention on behalf of foreigners, except
                            where there has been a denial of justice, is not admitted.</p>
                        <p>In conformity with this principle, and considering that the department of
                            war and marine is the department which has jurisdiction over cases such
                            as the one under <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0443"/>consideration,
                            I have to say to your excellency that the parties in interest may make
                            their claim directly to that department, and that if that department
                            dues not admit the responsibility of the Government, then it will
                            devolve upon the tribunals to decide the controversy.</p>
                        <p>In any event I may say this, that the owners of the Daylight cannot
                            present their claim through your excellency, the department under my
                            charge not ignoring that foreign ministers should only address the
                            Government to which they are accredited through the department of
                            foreign relations.</p>
                        <p>Article 8 of the constitution of this Republic gives to citizens of the
                            country, as well as foreigners, the right of petition done by writing
                            and in respectful terms, and therefore the second (foreigners) have free
                            access to the different departments of the public authority to seek for
                            justice when they consider themselves aggrieved by its agents or
                            subalterns.</p>
                        <p>I do not consider it necessary to examine your excellency’s assertion
                            that according to the customs of nations an individual cannot take
                            judicial proceedings against a national vessel; it is sufficient for my
                            purpose to say that, according to article 97 of the political
                            constitution of the Republic, tribunals of the federation have
                            jurisdiction, among other matters, of controversies arising under
                            maritime law, and of those to which the federation is a party, and that,
                            in consequence thereof, not only because of the marine disaster which
                            occurred to the Daylight, but because of the responsibility of the
                            Government, more or less affected in this case by reason of the
                            intervention therein of a war vessel, a double reason exists why the
                            parties complaining should submit their case to the said tribunals, if,
                            having first applied for redress to the department of war, they have not
                            had a decision in their favor.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatch No. 690, of the 21st September,
                        in relation to the claim of Capt. Fred. L. Blair, of the American schooner
                        Daylight, has been received.</p>
                    <p>The note of the 18th of September addressed to you by Mr. Fernandez, a copy
                        of which accompanies your dispatch, has been carefully considered; I regret
                        to find that the inquiry made in my instruction of the 24th of March last
                        (No. 382), and which it is perceived you submitted to Mr. Fernandez, has
                        not, as I conceive, been explicitly answered by the minister. The gunboat
                        Independencia is a war vessel of the Mexican Government; if liability to the
                        party injured attaches as a result of the Independencia’s action in running
                        down the American schooner, such liability is imputable, not to the
                        commander of the gunboat, but to the Mexican Government; if Mr. Fernandez is
                        to be understood as saying that an American citizen may, in such a case,
                        maintain legal proceedings for the recovery of the damages thus claimed
                        directly against the Government of Mexico in the courts of that Republic, I
                        have only to observe that I have not heretofore understood that under the
                        laws of Mexico the Government of that country might be sued in its own
                        courts either by a citizen of the Republic or a foreigner, without special
                        permission having first been given for that purpose, and before I could
                        consent to submit the claimant in the present case to the expense and delay
                        of such a proceeding it is desirable that I should be exactly informed on
                        that point.</p>
                    <p>In Mr. Mariscal’s note to you of the 3d of March last, that minister, amongst
                        other observations in regard to the claim, says: “If Captain Blair
                        considered that the Mexican Government is responsible for tile disaster
                        which his vessel suffered, he should apply directly to the department <pb
                            n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0444"/>of war and marine, under whose
                        jurisdiction the Independencia is. If that department admits the
                        responsibility of the Government in the matter, all difficulties will at
                        once disappear,” and the same sentiment is reiterated by Mr. Fernandez in
                        his note to you of the 15th ultimo. With reference to these suggestions I
                        have only to remark that the claim in question is presented by this
                        Government in behalf of its injured citizen through the ordinary and only
                        recognized channels of communication between it and that of Mexico, and if
                        by the laws or administrative regulations of that Republic it is made
                        essential that the facts should be first investigated by the ministry of war
                        and marine, it is conceived that the subject should be referred to that
                        department by the minister of foreign affairs. Such would be the course
                        pursued by this Government were a similar demand to be made on it by that of
                        Mexico. You will at as early a day as may be convenient bring these
                        suggestions to the attention of the Mexican minister of foreign affairs, and
                        you will say at the same time that, upon a careful examination of the facts,
                        this department reached the conclusion that the Mexican Government was
                        properly responsible for the damages resulting from the disaster in
                        question, and that the hope is entertained that the minister will see the
                        propriety and equity of an early adjustment of the claim.</p>

                            word, either from the city of Mexico or the United States, since July

                            the world now, and ought to be satisfied. I have been in prison and the
                            doctors have taken me out again. I have been a great sufferer in body
                            and mind. This is the first time I ever had any trouble with a vessel. I
                            have been master twenty-five years, served the Government in the Mexican
                            war and the late rebellion till the close.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Beach, the gentleman that came from Washington, was satisfied that I
                            had no fair trial in the courts at this place. My lawyer claims that
                            fact. All the Mexicans who were in this affair have their liberty and
                            are permitted to go away. I must some way try and get to some other
                            place, or die soon. I don’t know what news the United States consul
                            gets; he keeps all things secret from me, and I am left in darkness; no
                            one to tell me anything. I hope that I am not forgotten and will hear
                            something soon. I am thankful to you and remain,</p>

                        your No. 470, 15th November, 1883, I addressed a note to Señor Fernandez on
                        the 8th of December last, in which I again called his attention to the claim
                        of the owners of the schooner Daylight, by reason of the sinking of that
                        vessel by the Independencia, a Mexican national vessel.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to direct your honor’s attention to
                            the case of the schooner Daylight, which was sunk in the harbor of
                            Tampico by the Mexican gunboat Independencia, and with the details of
                            which your honor is familiar.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State at Washington, to which your honor’s note to me
                            of the 18th September was transmitted, does not find that the inquiry
                            which I made of his-excellency Señor Mariscal, in my note of the 11th
                            April last, has been explicitly answered by your honor, and I beg that
                            you will inform me whether the owners of the Daylight are entitled to
                            bring an action for damages resulting from the sinking of that vessel by
                            the Mexican gunboat Independencia against the Mexican Government, <pb
                                n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0446"/>directly before the Mexican
                            federal tribunal, without a special permission having been given for
                            that purpose?</p>
                        <p>I am aware that in your honor’s note of the 18th September you say that
                            under article 8 of the federal constitution the right of petition is
                            declared to be inviolable, and that under article 97 of the same charter
                            cases arising under maritime law are under the jurisdiction of the
                            federal tribunals. But I do not understand that the right of petition
                            covers the right to demand compensation for damages, or that because
                            ordinary cases arising under maritime law are placed under the
                            jurisdiction of the federal courts of the country, therefore the Mexican
                            Government may be sued therein by any person who has a claim against
                            that Government. I believe the general rule of law to be that a
                            sovereign cannot be sued in his own court without express permission,
                            and I see nothing in either of the articles of the Mexican constitution
                            to which your honor has referred me which takes the sovereignty rights
                            of Mexico out of the general rule to which I have referred.</p>
                        <p>I am also aware that, in his excellency, Señor Mariscal’s note to me of
                            the 3d of March last, in reference to the claim, he said, “If Captain
                            Blair considered that the Mexican Government is responsible for the
                            disaster which his vessel suffered, he should apply to the department of
                            war and marine to whose jurisdiction the Independencia belongs. If that
                            department admits the responsibility of the Government in the matter all
                            difficulties will at once disappear,” and that the same sentiment is
                            reiterated in your honor’s note to me of the 18th of September last.
                            Upon this point my Government is of the opinion that it has presented
                            the claim in question in behalf of its injured citizen through the
                            ordinary and only recognized channel of communication between it and
                            that of Mexico, and that if, by the laws or administrative regulations
                            of that Republic, it is made essential that the facts should be first
                            investigated by the ministry of war and marine, it conceives that the
                            subject should be referred to that department by the minister of foreign
                            affairs, which would be the course pursued by my Government were a
                            similar demand to be made on it by that of Mexico.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing suggestions I have been instructed to make to your honor,
                            and I have also been instructed to say that upon a careful examination
                            of the facts the Department of State at Washington has reached the
                            conclusion that the Mexican Government is properly responsible for the
                            damages resulting from the disaster in question and to express the hope
                            that your honor will see the propriety and equity of an early adjustment
                            of the claim.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I transmit herewith a copy of a dispatch from
                        the consul at La Paz, of the 19th ultimo, concerning the case of Captain
                        Caleb, late master of the American schooner Adriana. It will be perceived
                        that the Mexican circuit court at Culiacan has confirmed the sentence
                        pronounced upon Captain Caleb by the district court at La Paz, and that he
                        has now to suffer five years’ imprisonment, commencing from the date of his
                        arrest. It is also shown that the Adriana has been sold, and reported that
                        Captain Caleb has, through his attorney, petitioned the President of Mexico
                        for a pardon.</p>
                    <p>Your familiarity with the facts of Captain Caleb’s arrest, trial, and
                        conviction, from the papers which have from time to time been sent to you,
                        renders unnecessary any extended remarks upon these points. They afford,
                        however, in the judgment of the Department, good and sufficient grounds upon
                        which to present his case anew, with all its attendant circumstances and
                        hardships, to the Mexican Government, in support of the prisoner’s
                        application for a pardon. It is thought also that as a measure of justice to
                        Captain Caleb, who has assuredly suffered much, the President of Mexico
                        might be induced, upon proper <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0447"
                        />representations, to remit the balance of the sentence which that
                        unfortunate man is compelled to undergo.</p>
                    <p>While not disposed to interfere with the due course of law in Mexico, yet I
                        am induced to believe, from a thorough knowledge of all the facts of Captain
                        Caleb’s case, that the ends of justice will have been sufficiently met by
                        the punishment he has already borne, and that by the exercise of his
                        prerogative in that case the President of Mexico will afford a strong proof
                        of his friendship for this Government and at the same time be guilty of no
                        measure of injustice to his own Government.</p>
                    <p>You will, therefore, suitably present Captain Caleb’s case to the Mexican
                        Government and invoke executive clemency on his behalf.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In acknowledging the receipt of dispatch
                            No. 34, dated November 27 of this year, wherein I am directed that the
                            Department of State desires a report of the present condition of the
                            case of Captain Caleb, late master of American schooner Adriana,
                            arrested and tried for smuggling, and of any further proceedings therein
                            held since Mr. Beach’s investigation of the affair, I have the honor to
                            inform the Department that nothing of consequence has transpired in the
                            referred matter from the time of Mr. Beach leaving this place, except
                            what already has been reported in my dispatch No. 44 of August 16 last,
                            relative to the Mexican circuit court at Culiacan, Sinaloa, having
                            confirmed the sentence of the district court of this city; therefore
                            Captain Caleb is now confined to suffer the penalty of five years’
                            imprisonment, commencing from the first day of his arrest.</p>
                        <p>The schooner Adriana was sold at public auction on the 23d and 26th of
                            October, 1883, as per accompanying notice, published in the Weekly Voz
                            de California of the 17th, also of its corresponding translation.</p>
                        <p>On the 21st of the above said month Captain Caleb, convicted, was
                            officially transferred from the jurisdiction of the federal court to
                            that of the governor, who is to put in execution the penalty decreed of
                            five years’ imprisonment; consequently, the governor issued orders at
                            once for the removal of Captain Caleb from his private residence into
                            the public jail, where he remained until the 30th of said October, when,
                            at my instance, the governor released him under parole of his keeping
                            within the boundary of the private residence he now occupies. I have
                            also been informed that subsequently, and through his attorney, Captain
                            Caleb has petitioned to the President of the Republic of Mexico
                            requesting pardon.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatches Nos. 477, 12th December, 1883;
                        492, 17th January, 1884; 494, 19th January, 1884, with their inclosures,
                        have been received. They all refer to the case of Capt. George Caleb, late
                        master of the Adriana.</p>
                    <p>I regret to see that the Hon. John F. Miller, a Senator from California,
                        appears to be of the opinion that the case of Captain Caleb has been
                        neglected by me. I think I have done everything in my power to protect him
                        in his rights.</p>
                    <p>You will remember that the investigation of his case was intrusted to a
                        special agent of the Department of State, and that in transmitting to me a
                        copy of that agent’s report to you, you informed me that Captain Caleb was
                        represented in the appeal by counsel who appeared zealous in his behalf, and
                        that the future legal proceedings which might be taken in his behalf would
                        be reported directly to you. (See your dispatch No. 441, 16th August,
                        1883.)</p>
                    <p>When that dispatch was received Captain Caleb’s case was pending on appeal in
                        the court at Culiacan. I was subsequently informed by Consul Viosca that the
                        appellate court had affirmed the sentence of the court below, and this I
                        communicated to you in my dispatch No. 683, 3d September, 1883.</p>
                    <p>Whether any appeal was taken by Captain Caleb from the judgment of the court
                        at Culiacan or not I have not been informed.</p>
                    <p>When I knew that the case was before the Culiacan court I requested Consul
                        Kelton, at Mazatlan, within whose consular district Culiacan is, to send me
                        a copy of the record of the case should the judgment of the lower court be
                        affirmed, in order that I might be able to ascertain whether the proceedings
                        against him had been legally conducted. (See my dispatch No. 662, 9th July,
                        1883.) The copy of the record asked for has never been received by me. An
                        inspection of the records of the judicial proceedings against him was the
                        only “investigation” of his case possible to me. However, on the receipt of
                        your dispatch, No. 447, I telegraphed Consul Kelton to inform me whether
                        Captain Caleb was in prison still 5 and, if so, where.</p>
                    <p>Consul Kelton replied that Captain Caleb was still at La Paz; that the
                        “expediente” (record) of his case had been sent to the supreme court here,
                        and that Captain Caleb, through the minister of justice, had applied to the
                        President for a pardon.</p>
                    <p>Before receiving the consul’s reply I had, in an interview with Señor
                        Fernandez, again called his attention to Captain Caleb’s case, and urged
                        upon him his release. I called his attention to the man’s age, his
                        helplessness, his ill health, the necessity he was to his family, and to the
                        fact that the Adriana having been confiscated and sold, everything he had
                        had been taken from him, and that this, added to the fact that he had
                        already been in prison a year, appeared to be a sufficient punishment for
                        the offence which he was charged with having committed. Señor Fernandez then
                        informed me (and I learned it for the first time) that Captain Caleb had
                        petitioned for a pardon, and that in his petition he had confessed his
                        guilt.</p>
                    <p>I then urged upon him that even if he were guilty (upon which I expressed no
                        opinion) still he was not more guilty than were the Mexicans <pb n="349"
                            xml:id="pg_349" facs="0449"/>engaged with him in the enterprise which
                        resulted in his capture and the sentence against him, and that it appeared
                        to me the height of injustice that he (an American) should be punished for
                        an offense while his partners (Mexicans) who had been arrested with him had
                        not even been prosecuted therefor. Señor Fernandez said that he would
                        converse with the President upon the subject and see what could be done. In
                        this interview” I asked him if he would procure and furnish me with a copy
                        of Captain Caleb’s petition to the minister of justice for a pardon. He
                        promised me he would do so. The main difficulty which Señor Fernandez
                        appeared to find in the way of Caleb’s discharge was the apprehension that
                        as soon as he was set at liberty he would present a claim through this
                        legation for damages.</p>
                    <p>On the 1st of January, 1884, I saw Señor Fernandez again. He informed me that
                        he had brought Captain Caleb’s case to the notice of the President, who was
                        favorably disposed to granting him relief, but that he could not pardon him,
                        because, by the law of Mexico, no pardon can be granted until two fifths of
                        the sentence pronounced against the applicant has been executed. I again
                        urged upon Señor Fernandez such further reasons as occurred to me for his
                        release, and again asked him for a copy of Caleb’s petition for pardon,
                        which he again promised to send me as soon as he had received it.</p>
                    <p>In the mean time I called on Señor Romero Rubio and asked him what steps
                        could be taken for Caleb’s protection in court in case he had appealed, or
                        before the minister of justice in case he had asked for a pardon.</p>
                    <p>Subsequently he informed me that he had had an interview with the minister of
                        justice, who was favorably disposed, but that his application for pardon
                        could not be acted upon unless the judgment was final, and he did not know
                        whether it was final or not. Even if it were, however, it would not be in
                        the power of the President to grant it for the reasons which Señor Fernandez
                        gave me, and which I have set forth above. But he said that the President
                        had it in his power to commute the sentence, and that if such an application
                        were made it would be favorably considered, and, in his opinion, that was
                        the best course to pursue. This application, he said, could be made by any
                        person. In this interview I asked Señor Rubio if the minister of justice had
                        shown him Captain Caleb’s petition for pardon, and if it really contained an
                        acknowledgment of his guilt. He replied that he had been shown the petition,
                        and that it did contain the acknowledgment.</p>
                    <p>It was after this interview with Señor Rubio that I received Consul Kelton’s
                        telegram of the 29th December, 1883, referred to above, informing me that
                        Captain Caleb was still at La Paz; that the “expediente” (record) of his
                        case had been sent to the supreme court here; and that he had applied to the
                        President, through the minister of justice, for a pardon, so that I was
                        assured of his having petitioned for clemency by Señor Fernandez, Señor
                        Rubio, and Consul Kelton, while his acknowledgment of guilt was stated to
                        have been made by the two parties first named.</p>
                    <p>I then employed Mr. Arthur P. Cushing, a member of the Boston bar and a
                        practitioner here, to examine the files of the supreme court with the view
                        of ascertaining whether the record in Captain Caleb’s case was on them, as I
                        wished to be informed whether it was there on appeal by Caleb, or whether it
                        had been sent there in the usual course of the judicial proceedings as
                        practiced in the country.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cushing informed me that after diligent search he could not find that the
                        record had ever been sent to the supreme court.</p>
                    <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0450"/>
                    <p>I then asked Mr. Gushing whether, under his own responsibility, he would
                        present a petition to the minister of justice asking on behalf of Caleb a
                        commutation of his sentence. This, it appeared to me, would be the shortest
                        and most practical way of getting him out of his trouble, for if his
                        sentence could be commuted to a fine, to be paid in the obligations of the
                        Government (as I am assured it could be managed), it will amount to only a
                        small sum in reality. Mr. Cushing agreed to do so, and he did so. Then he
                        called on me and said that the minister of justice desired that I should
                        authorize him to appear for Caleb. This I declined to do, for the reason
                        that, although it had been positively stated to me, both by Señor Fernandez
                        and Señor Rubio, that they had seen his admission of guilt, I could not
                        bring myself to believe that after all his protestations of innocence to
                        this legation he could acknowledge that the offense for which he was
                        suffering had been properly charged against him, and I did not propose to do
                        anything which would have the appearance of an acknowledgment of his guilt.
                        It was then stated to Mr. Cushing that a telegram from Caleb to him
                        authorizing him to make the appearance above referred to would suffice. Mr.
                        Cushing caused Caleb to be telegraphed on the 21st ultimo to that effect. To
                        this telegram no answer has been made, except that Caleb telegraphed me on
                        the 8th instant that he had telegraphed the minister of justice ratifying
                        his petition for a pardon made in October last, and asking me to second
                        it.</p>
                    <p>In my dispatch No. 662, July 9 last, I informed you that I had requested
                        Consul Kelton to procure and transmit to me, if possible, a copy of the
                        record of the proceedings in the court of Culiacan, in case the judgment of
                        the court at La Paz should be affirmed. Consul Kelton has not complied with
                        my request. I inquired of him the reason why, in a dispatch which I
                        addressed to him on the 5th of January, 1884. Consul Kelton, in his dispatch
                        of the 4th of February, explains how it is that my request was not complied
                        with. His residence is 200 miles distant from Culiacan, which prevented him
                        from giving it his personal attention. He, however, wrote to the consular
                        agent at Altata, as well as to a party at Culiacan, upon the subject. The
                        consular agent at Altata had resigned, and the correspondent at Culiacan had
                        left the place.</p>
                    <p>Neither have I been informed nor have I been able to ascertain whether Caleb
                        appealed from the judgment of that court.</p>
                    <p>As in in your dispatch No. 441, August 16, 1883, I was told that Mr. Galan,
                        Caleb’s counsel, would correspond directly with the Department upon the
                        result of that trial and any subsequent proceedings in the case, I assumed
                        that he would comply with his instructions, and that I would receive
                        instructions in respect thereto, but I have received none; nor have I heard
                        from him in respect thereto. It was therefore impossible for me to take any
                        further official steps in the matter.</p>
                    <p>Thinking that Señor Fernandez had forgotten to send me the copy of Captain
                        Caleb’s petition for a pardon, which he had promised, I addressed him a note
                        on the 21st of January, reminding him of his promise.</p>
                    <p>On the 7th instant I received his note of the 4th, transmitting to me a copy
                        of the petition for pardon, in the concluding part of which Caleb says:
                            <quote rend="blockquote">

                                the schooner Adriana, in the bay of Pulmo, to Los Frailes, in Lower

                        that he transported effects from his vessel while in the bay of Pulmo to Los

                                by a person who has rendered important services to the nation, when
                                the Government considers it necessary to the public peace, or when
                                it appears that the prisoner is innocent Captain Caleb does not come
                                under either of these categories, according to his own
                                admissions.</item>

                            <item>In all other cases it may be granted when the prisoner has
                                completed two-fifths of his sentence. Under this law, then, the
                                President would have no authority to pardon, as Captain Caleb has
                                not been in confinement that length of his sentence.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>I have not felt myself at liberty, under my instructions, to ask for anything
                        else than his pardon, and this I did the day after I received a copy of his
                        petition therefor. As the power to pardon necessarily includes the power to
                        commute, I am in hopes that the President, if he finds it impossible to
                        liberate him absolutely, will commute his sentence to the payment of a sum
                        of money. Whatever the President may do in the matter I will inform you by
                        telegraph. Should the sentence be commuted to the payment of a sum of money,
                        in what manner can it be procured?</p>
                    <p>In the meanwhile I deem it only proper that you should be informed how far
                        your instructions respecting Captain Caleb have been carried out.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">of the Republic of Mexico:</hi></p>
                        <p>Arthur P. Cushing, an American citizen domiciled in this city,
                            respectfully comes before you and says: That my fellow-citizen, the
                            American citizen George Caleb, captain of the American schooner the
                            Adriana, was taken prisoner in the Gulf of California, and taken, with
                            the Adriana to the port of La Paz.</p>
                        <p>The alleged motive for his arrest was that he intended to smuggle. The
                            case was submitted to a competent tribunal, which resulted in a judgment
                            of first and second instance, which condemned the vessel and sentenced
                            Caleb to five years’ imprisonment.</p>
                        <p>As well as his representative as on my own account every confidence is
                            placed in the tribunal; but as Captain Caleb is an old man, who has a
                            family to support who are dependent upon his labor; and as, besides, he
                            has already been a year in prison, and as he is very infirm, and if his
                            imprisonment continues he will likely die, leaving a numerous family in
                            poverty, it appears to me proper that I should, knowing the justice and
                            rectitude of the supreme magistrate of this nation, bring to your
                            knowledge that this being the first time Captain Caleb has been in
                            Mexico he was ignorant of the customs and laws of the country; that he
                            came here for account of other parties, <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352"
                                facs="0452"/>and that he could not suppose that those whose
                            merchandise he had on his vessel intended to violate the laws of the
                            country. Captain Caleb’s situation is so anomalous that two judgments
                            were pronounced against him, while the authors of the smuggling who
                            escaped were not prosecuted, from which results the legal absurdity that
                            the really guilty parties, Mexican citizens are at liberty, while the
                            foreigner alone, who was only a passive and innocent instrument, has
                            been punished with the loss of his entire fortune, and condemned to a
                            long imprisonment.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons, and from the sentiments of humanity which it is well
                            known are entertained by the chief of the Mexican nation, I appear in
                            Captain Caleb’s behalf to beg for a commutation of the sentence which
                            has been passed upon him, and to ask you to grant to an old man, a
                            foreigner, ill to such an extent that if his imprisonment is prolonged
                            he will die far from his home and family.</p>
                        <p>In the name of this unhappy family, afflicted with grief and soon to
                            become orphans, I ask whether you, Mr. President, will not furnish
                            another proof that the good and philanthropic feelings of the heart know
                            no nationality, but that they are the same for foreigners and Mexicans
                            alike when they need them. In the name also of this aged man, who has
                            grown gray in a constant strife with the waves to obtain a support for
                            his numerous family, I appeal to you, and beg that you will grant the
                            commutation which Captain Caleb has prayed for.</p>
                        <p>He will owe to you more than his pardon. He will be your debtor for his
                            life, his tranquillity, and the support of his numerous family.</p>

                    <p>George Caleb, a native of the State of Massachusetts, United States of
                        America, and a citizen thereof, respectfully represents: That in December of
                        the year last past he came to Lower California in command of the American
                        schooner Adriana, of which he was a part owner, in the acquisition of which
                        he had invested the savings of years and had pledged his credit, and that on
                        his first voyage he was arrested, with his vessel, in Mexican waters,
                        accused of smuggling, imprisoned, tried, convicted, and sentenced to lose
                        his vessel and to five years’ imprisonment, after having expended for the
                        maintenance of the crew of his vessel the freight which he had earned.</p>
                    <p>It would be useless to recapitulate the facts which have brought me to the
                        prison in which I am languishing and perishing, and besides, to do so I
                        should have to criminate others, and thus, besides being a prisoner, I
                        should become an informer.</p>
                    <p>But, sir, I am fifty-six years of age. I have a family to support. I have
                        lost everything I possessed, besides my credit, and the ten months
                        imprisonment which I have suffered has reduced me to such a miserable state
                        of health, that the doctors (who generally give hope to their patients) will
                        not say that I will recover.</p>
                    <p>The ends which the legislator had in view have been sufficiently answered by
                        the severe punishment which I am suffering, without its being aggravated by
                        the death to which I shall be exposed if I am kept in prison during the
                        whole time to which I have been sentenced, and I have faith that the
                        President will look with humane eyes upon my position, and will exercise the
                        holy prerogative which the law gives him to pardon offenses committed
                        against the federal laws.</p>
                    <p>I beg you to pardon me for the smuggling committed in December of the year
                        last passed in transporting goods from the schooner Adriana, in the bay of
                        Pulmo, to Los Frailes, in Lower California, and that I may receive the mercy
                        and pardon which I implore.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have been instructed by the Department
                            of State at Washington to bring to the consideration of your honor’s
                            Government the case of Capt. George Caleb, of the American schooner
                            Adriana.</p>
                        <p>Captain Caleb, as the correspondence between this legation and the
                            department for foreign relations shows, was on a voyage with his vessel
                            from San Francisco to La Paz, Lower California. Having reached the Gulf
                            of California, he was, on or about the 1st of January, 1883, arrested by
                            Mexican officials and, with his vessel and crew, taken to La Paz, where
                            they, as well as the vessel itself, were prosecuted for smuggling. The
                            goods which it was said it was the intention of Captain Caleb to smuggle
                            were condemned, as was also his vessel. The crew were discharged and
                            Captain Caleb was condemned by the court at La Paz to live years’
                            imprisonment. The case was appealed to the court at Culiacan, where the
                            judgment of the lower court was affirmed. He is now in confinement.</p>
                        <p>My Government has been informed that Captain Caleb has applied to his
                            excellency the President of Mexico for a pardon, and it is with the view
                            of obtaining executive clemency in his behalf that I have been
                            instructed to bring his case again before you.</p>
                        <p>Captain Caleb is a man advanced in years and infirm. He was ill when he
                            was taken prisoner, and is, I am informed, now in a suffering state of
                            health. So infirm is he that from the day of his arrest, through the
                            humanity of the authorities at La Paz, he was permitted to lodge in a
                            private house, and after his sentence, and when he was sent to the
                            common jail, such was his condition that the authorities removed him
                            thereupon and again allowed him to remain in a private dwelling.</p>
                        <p>He has a family entirely dependent upon him for support. All the property
                            he had was his interest in the schooner Adriana, and, that vessel having
                            been confiscated, he is now destitute. His ruin is therefore complete,
                            and if the balance of the sentence to which he has been sentenced be
                            remitted, he and his family would be dependent upon his daily labor for
                            his daily bread. Surely this would appear to be punishment enough for so
                            trifling an offense as he was found guilty of.</p>
                        <p>But it is not probable that he will survive his imprisonment. He has been
                            in confinement now for more than a year. Assuming him to be guilty of
                            the offense which he is charged with having committed, my Government is
                            induced to believe that the ends of justice will have been sufficiently
                            met by the punishment he has already borne, and that by the exercise of
                            his prerogative in the case his excellency the President of Mexico will
                            afford a strong proof of his friendship to the Government of the United
                            States and at the same time be guilty of no measure of injustice to the
                            Government of Mexico.</p>
                        <p>There are circumstances connected with this case which would seem to
                            insure the favorable consideration of his excellency the President to
                            the application of Captain Caleb for pardon, which I have been
                            instructed to join in. When the Adriana was first boarded by Mexican
                            officials she was lying at anchor, and there was nothing to indicate
                            that she had been engaged in an illicit trade.</p>
                        <p>It was after the Mexican officers had left her that they discovered a
                            small vessel heading for the coast. They intercepted her and found on
                            her a trifling amount of merchandise which her crew said had been
                            transshipped from the Adriana. This vessel was seized and conveyed to
                            where the Adriana was anchored, and both vessels, with their crews, were
                            taken in custody to La Paz. Both vessels were prosecuted and both were
                            condemned. But only Captain Caleb and the crew of the Adriana were
                            prosecuted.</p>
                        <p>The crew of the Mexican vessel, whose guilt was certainly equal to that
                            of Captain Caleb, have never been punished.</p>
                        <p>Considering all the circumstances of the case, I hope that his excellency
                            the President will find it in his power to comply with the appeal of my
                            Government in support of the petition which this aged, infirm, and
                            unfortunate man has made for a remission of the punishment which he has
                            been subjected to.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Having acted as interpreter during Captain
                            Caleb’s trial, I deem it a duty to that gentleman to make an impartial
                            statement of the facts as they came under my cognizance. It was known in
                            this place, and commented upon, that a schooner, name unknown, had been
                            seen for fully a week or ten days previous to the Adriana’s arrival
                            standing off and on, going out to sea at daylight and toward land at
                            night. This can be proved when the time comes, but no mention was made
                            of this circumstance during the trial. An inquiry into the matter would
                            have brought out the true facts and led to the conviction of the truly
                            guilty parties. Before the Adriana was brought into port, Napoleon Savin
                            lodged information in writing in the custom-house, stating that he had
                            found some cases of goods on the shore of a place called Frailes Bay.
                            This point was also overlooked in the investigation. As to the
                            depositions given in, the witnesses thereto being, to a certain extent,
                            subject to control or pressure, I place no reliance on them legally and
                            morally speaking, as they [the witnesses] were not free agents in this
                            matter, and were not cross-examined to my knowledge.</p>
                        <p>On the 27th December, 1882, the Adriana was at anchor in Frailes Bay,
                            into which anchorage she had been driven by stress of weather, it being
                            unsafe to keep to sea in the state she was in, sails torn, cargo
                            shifted, leaking badly, and crew used up. Here it was that the revenue
                            sloop found her at anchor. The officer boarded her and demanded the
                            ship’s papers, and, after having examined them, remarked that they were
                            in due form and he would report them as such. At daylight of the same
                            day a boat in which the smuggled goods were found was inshore, fully 2
                            miles away, as the mate and crew have repeatedly told me, the chart
                            bearing them out, said boat remaining at anchor from 9 a. in. to 4 p.m.,
                            when she was seized. After the seizure the boat was brought alongside
                            the Adriana.</p>
                        <p>During the examinations; at no time did the crew in the slightest manner
                            vary their statements, and one and all from first to last said the same
                            thing, and unanimously bear witness to Caleb’s mental derangement for
                            some time previous. This important fact was completely ignored during
                            the trial. Had due consideration been taken, it would have materially
                            changed the face of the affair. The animus was not concealed, as the men
                            in whose possession were found the goods, <hi rend="italic">corpus
                                delicti</hi>, were allowed to escape, and the statement of an insane
                            man was considered sufficient for conviction.</p>
                        <p>The law deems a man innocent until his guilt has been conclusively
                            proved, and lays down certain fixed principles, which are so many
                            finger-posts laying out our road. On the morning of the 28th the men
                            were put ashore. Now arises the question if, as the officer says, he
                            found a boat alongside, why were the receivers allowed to go? According
                            to the definition of crime—“doing what the law forbids or failing to do
                            what it commands”—it is unaccountable and exceedingly strange, the
                            action taken in this matter, and more so if we call to mind the pains
                            and penalties attached to receivers of goods which are dutiable. And,
                            furthermore, as the interested party claimed that he was tempted to
                            betray his trust, in this arises a question of veracity between the two.
                            As they were taken ashore one of them remarked, “Good-bye, captain; they
                            have taken all our money and are letting us go,” which tallies with the
                            officer’s statement regarding bribery. In all laws the principle is laid
                            down, first find who will derive the greatest benefit from the crime
                            committed and yon will find the true criminal. Comment is
                            unnecessary.</p>
                        <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0455"/>
                        <p>If in the laws of evidence certain rules are laid down in regard to
                            witnesses, they have been totally disregarded, and in common law their
                            testimony would have been overruled if the judge knew his duty and
                            wanted to do it. Vattel lays down the principle that we are bound to
                            obey the laws of the country we may happen to be in. Granted, but any
                            infraction thereof must be remedied, pursuant to the same, by the action
                            of the home government, as absence does not dissolve the tie that exists
                            between the citizen and his country.</p>
                        <p>It is the duty of every judge before passing sentence to take into
                            consideration the standing and character of the accused, his previous
                            reputation in a word, to pass in review the past life of the accused,
                            and then weigh the facts impartially ere he can arrive at a final
                            decision. This was not done, or, if it was, it does not appear, as the
                            sentence was to the full extent of the law.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, at the time the statement was made in the custom-house the
                            sailors protested against it as the action of an insane man. This was
                            not heeded, as it should have been, and their subsequent testimony bears
                            out the fact, corroborated by the medical certificate of Drs. Hidalgo
                            and Martinez. These gentlemen examined Captain Caleb, and said
                            certificate is in the trial papers. It may be safely affirmed that it is
                            the first time that the admission of one suffering temporary derangement
                            has been used for conviction, and in all likelihood it will never happen
                            again, as it is hard to believe that the law will ever be twisted in
                            such a way as it has been under pressure. This is proved on the appeal
                            and letter from Culiacan, which has been seen by many parties here. In
                            this letter the statement is made that the case has been fixed to suit
                            the wishes of the party to whom it was addressed.</p>
                        <p>The twentieth article of the constitution of 1857, in the definition of
                            the rights of man, lays down the guarantees which in this case have been
                            foully wronged. Fraction third declares “that he shall be brought before
                            his accuser, and shall know the parties testifying against him.” This
                            was not done, and therefore the whole proceeding is null and void, as no
                            unconstitutional act can be considered legal. This being a violation
                            which involves official responsibility, I am not bound to abide by a
                            decision, when the guarantees accorded to criminals have been denied
                            me.</p>
                        <p>The true animus was plainly demonstrated during the trial, and the
                            sentence has proved it beyond doubt. The crew were not brought face to
                            face with the captors, nor were they, the witnesses for the prosecution,
                            examined in the presence of the accused, if at all, save in the
                            preliminary examination, and then not in his presence.</p>
                        <p>Fraction fourth declares that “he shall be furnished with all the data
                            necessary for his defense.” This was not done, as only garbled copies
                            were furnished to the defense; another infraction, to which attention is
                            most respectfully called. As we are bound to obey the laws of the
                            country in which we may happen to be, we are justified in protesting
                            against any violation thereof. Such are the facts in this case, and the
                            statement here made can be verified by the copy of the proceedings sent
                            to Washington.</p>
                        <p>We shall now review the case and judge it accordingly.</p>
                        <p>Smuggling is the act of introducing goods clandestinely. No substantial
                            proof was brought forward during the trial. The crew denied the
                            allegation made by the cook and boy, and then the defense was not
                            allowed to cross-question the witnesses for the prosecution; thereby the
                            defense was made a farce, as the means to make it good were denied. In
                            all laws the accused or defendant has undoubted right, through his
                            attorney, to cross-question, and by those means arrive at the truth. But
                            in this case it was not so, as has been shown. Had the vessel been
                            consigned to any other house, in this port she would never have been
                            seized, and this is the opinion of many, if not all, of the inhabitants
                            of this place. Said house has made many enemies, and they are watching
                            for an opening to injure it, should opportunity occur. The goods that
                            were seized at Frailes’ Bay were marked P. H. &amp; Co.; the numbers did
                            not agree with the manifest nor with the description of goods it called
                            for, and the duties were paid on the cargo and the cases seized were the
                            only ones that were contraband. Another point. The sentence called for
                            the imprisonment of the guilty parties, and they are at large, and, so
                            far as known, no effort has been made for their arrest. The only
                            sufferer throughout is an American citizen, who claims, and justly so,
                            the protection of his country.</p>

                            United States consul, as I am well aware that there has been some foul
                            play against me, and have good reason to believe the United States
                            consul has been deceiving me all this time and working in the interest
                            of some Mexican relatives of his. He will not tell me anything that
                            passes in my case, and will not answer my letters. It is said that I am
                            kept here as a sacrifice to save some Mexican’s reputation and losses.
                            It is about time for me to open my eyes and to know who has done his
                            duty by me. I don’t consider that I have been treated like an American
                            citizen at this place or as a gentleman, and if the United States consul
                            don’t inform me as to whom to look to for my right, I cannot see
                            anything he has done to help me out of this deep distress. He never
                            looked for testimony in my behalf to send to the State Department, and
                            never was present in court while the trial was going on to see justice
                            done me. He did not interest himself about me or the crew, and got on
                            bad terms with my lawyer. I had no one to look to, I being sick in bed
                            and not able to defend myself. I don’t know who the parties were who
                            testified against me, as I never saw them. My trial never was read to me
                            and my sentence was not pronounced by the judge who committed me. I have
                            not heard one word about the appeal of my case, and there is no one to
                            inform me. I could say much more but I am in the power of a certain set
                            of men at this place who might make things more uncomfortable for me.
                            Mr. Beach was not long enough in this place to give out the true facts
                            of this case and that is why I wish to know of his report, or the part
                            of it he got from the United States consul. All the men who were accused
                            with me were at large all the time the trial was going on. When sentence
                            was passed they left, and some of them are here now on the streets, no
                            attempt being made to detain them. Is that right? A man cannot smuggle
                            alone. I am about sixty years old, forty years at sea, twenty-five years
                            master, and this is my first trouble with a vessel. Three years ago my
                            vessel lost about $900. W. Ward, Sacramento street, paid the bill. I was
                            half owner of the vessel when signed, besides $105 tonnage, dues, and
                            pilotage. The men were paid three and a half months after seizure of
                            vessel, their board while in prison, and three months extra wages and
                            sent home. Is all this right? I am sick and I cannot gain my health. I
                            have had the yellow fever and the effects of it are in me, with my other
                            complaints, and God only knows what I have suffered in body and mind
                            these thirteen months. No friends, never a kind word, and not a sight of
                            the consul. If there is a vice-consul I have never seen him. General R.
                            M. Rangil, governor, has treated me kindly so far. He is a fine
                            gentleman. If any testimony is required, the interpreter in the case
                            will give details. His name is F. R. Maytorena. He knows all the facts
                            about the case. Please excuse a badly written letter, as I am not in a
                            condition to write, and have no one to write for me. I beg to be excused
                            for taking up your valuable time, and allow me to remain your humble
                            servant,</p>

                            <p>Mr. Beach told me not to write any more to the Department. I would
                                not have done so, but I don’t think things are going right about my
                                case at this place.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Yours duly received. As it would take too long
                        to go into details to show just when and where the infractions of law
                        occurred, I will give you a plain statement of the facts of the case from
                        notes taken during the trial and from information given me by the mate and
                        crew of the Adriana.</p>
                    <p>The schooner Adriana, George Caleb master, on a voyage from San Francisco to
                        La Paz, was compelled by stress of weather to put into Frailes Bay with her
                        sails torn and deck-load shifted, and leaking badly, as is shown by
                        reference to her log-book. While she was at anchor at this place, with two
                        anchors down with sixty fathoms of chain to each, the revenue sloop came up
                        and the officer in charge asked to see the ship’s papers. These were
                        examined by him in the presence of the crew, and were declared to be all
                        right, and you were told that you might go when and where you pleased. At
                        the same time he gave you a letter to the collector of this port, which,
                        after the sloop on which the goods were found had been seized, he called for
                        and destroyed.</p>
                    <p>At the time of her seizure this sloop was fully two miles away, inshore.
                        Immediately after her seizure, however, she was brought over to the Adriana,
                        and permission was asked and obtained to put the cases that were on board on
                        the schooner’s deck. These circumstances the men were not permitted to
                        relate, being told that they were irrelevant. It may also be stated that
                        only one man of this sloop’s crew was brought to this place, being brought
                        here on the 7th day of January, 1883, and set at liberty, a proceeding for
                        which I have so far been unable to find a precedent.</p>
                    <p>As the two sloops were being towed by the Adriana from Frailes Bay to this
                        place the schooner was boarded, when 30 miles at sea, her papers seized, and
                        command assumed by the captors. It is stated by the mate, who was in command
                        at the time, you being sick and unable to keep on deck, that no order was
                        shown him, and that when the vessel got into port he was forbidden to hoist
                        the Hag. You were made a prisoner in your cabin, and were not allowed to
                        hold intercourse with any one.</p>
                    <p>By such procedure two rules of the Ley de Partida were infringed. As to
                        receivers it is provided:</p>
                    <p>“To all those guilty of the commission of crime, of counseling it, and of
                        concealing it shall be applied the same penalty” [translation]. Regla 19,
                        tit. 24, Partida 7.</p>
                    <p>When you were taken to the custom-house you were temporarily deranged by
                        illness. In such case it is provided:</p>
                    <p>“A man is out of his wits when he does nothing straightforwardly, and
                        therefore he cannot bind himself, because he neither knows nor can
                        distinguish between that which injures and that which benefits him”
                        [translation]. Regla 4, tit. 34, Partida—.</p>
                    <p>Such are the facts in regard to your case. I could enlarge upon them, but it
                        would take too much time, as the mail is about to close. But should you
                        desire me at any future time as a witness, I shall always be ready, law in
                        hand, to bear witness to what I have stated; and I am confident that I could
                        show that no opportunity was given you to present your defense.</p>
                    <p>With the greatest regard, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p>P. S.—Having been appointed interpreter by the court, I am cognizant of
                            all that took place. One of the parties sentenced is now at large, the
                            true animus being to injure you. When Mr. Beach was here I expected to
                            be called upon for information, but was not, nor can I say that the
                            consul or vice-consul were in court, although the crew often said they
                            wanted the consul present. He took no interest in the case, and made no
                            effort for the release of the crew, who were kept in jail seventy-five
                            days. The judge bade me tell them that their detention was illegal.</p>

                        while at anchor outside of the bar near the harbor of Tampico, being then on
                        her voyage from Key West, Fla., with a cargo of lumber for Tampico, was, on
                        the 21st of March, 1882, at night, run into by the Mexican gunboat
                        Independencia, the vessel and cargo becoming a total loss; with that

                        month on the subject, addressed to you by Mr. Fernandez, the secretary for
                        foreign relations of Mexico.</p>
                    <p>I have given to the suggestions of that minister’s note such consideration as
                        its importance and the high source from which these suggestions emanate
                        demand. Mr. Fernandez, conceiving that the views of his Government as
                        heretofore presented by him had not been fully understood by this
                        Department, reiterates the essential points of his previous arguments,
                        stating, in a categorical form, the grounds upon which they rest. These, for
                        convenience, I briefly restate. They are: “That the owners of the Daylight
                        can make their direct demand on the Mexican Government before the Mexican
                        tribunals without previous permission. That the Mexican Government is
                        considered as a person, and as such can sue and be sued before the proper
                        tribunals.”</p>
                    <p>From these grounds Mr. Fernandez concludes that should the Government deem it
                        best that the matter of the Daylight be settled between the two Governments,
                        the United States minister and the Mexican department of foreign affairs
                        will be the medium through which the settlement <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359"
                            facs="0459"/>will be made, the department of war and navy acting as
                        witnesses only of the facts. “But,” says Mr. Fernandez, “it having been a
                        practice constantly sustained by the Government that a diplomatic course
                        cannot be taken when it interferes in favor of persons, except in case of a
                        denial of justice, Señor Mariscal and I had the honor to notify your
                        excellency that the complainant (or complainants) must himself appear before
                        the department of war and navy, regretting that such a course is
                        necessary.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. Fernandez’s sixth and last conclusion is that “the disaster of the
                        Daylight having occurred in Mexican waters the Mexican tribunals are the
                        proper ones to hear this case, as well as any other which treats of the
                        defining of civil or criminal responsibility, and decide what grade or form
                        of responsibility must be laid upon the delinquents in the deplorable
                        case.”</p>
                    <p>Upon a careful examination of these several propositions of the distinguished
                        secretary for foreign relations of Mexico, I find myself wholly unable to
                        agree with him in the conclusion that the doctrine embraced in them can,
                        with any legal propriety, be considered applicable to the case of the
                        Daylight. In his note to you of the same date regarding the case of the
                        Sidbury, a copy of which accompanies your 776, referring to this same
                        jurisdictional contention, Mr. Fernandez says: “This opinion does not merely
                        rest upon the principle that the courts are called upon to redress injuries
                        which are suffered by the inhabitants of the country or those who are
                        transiently therein, for the purpose for which they are established is to
                        administer justice.” Giving to this proposition the interpretation which it
                        has received from all writers on public law, and hitherto accepted by all
                        civilized governments, that is, that the municipal civil laws can only be
                        held applicable to and operative on the rights, property, and persons of the
                        citizens of the country and foreigners who may be either permanently or
                        temporarily residing in the country, I find no difficulty in acceding to it.
                        This, however, is all that can be claimed for it—all, as it is believed,
                        that is claimed for it by the governments of Christian nations—and all that
                        is allowed to it by the uniform declaration of writers on public law.
                        “Considered,” says Halleck, “in an international point of view, either the
                        thing or the person made the subject of the jurisdiction must be within the
                        territory, for no sovereignty can extend its process beyond its own
                        territorial limits so as to subject either persons or property to its
                        judicial decisions, and every exertion of authority of its sort beyond its
                        limits is a mere nullity and incapable of binding such persons or property
                        in any other tribunals.”</p>
                    <p>The same doctrine is found stated in different forms of expression in
                        Phillimore, in Wheaton, in Westlake, and in Woolsey. I am not aware that it
                        has ever been questioned.</p>
                    <p>The owners of the Daylight were never residents of Mexico, either permanent
                        or temporary. They are not known to have ever been in that country. The
                        master of the vessel was not a resident of Mexico, either permanent or
                        temporary, and was never in the country beyond the port at which his vessel
                        might touch. At the time of the occurrence which gave rise to the claim the
                        vessel could scarcely be said, with strict propriety, to have been in
                        Mexican waters. She was anchored outside the bar, near the harbor of
                        Tampico, in an exceptionally rough sea, at the close of a severe storm,
                        which rendered it unsafe for her to attempt to cross the bar or enter the
                        harbor. To insist that those claimants shall go from Maine to Tampico to
                        seek redress in the Mexican tribunals for a grievous wrong suffered at the
                        hands of a high <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0460"/>officer of the navy
                        of that Republic, and in such proceedings to be met by the evidence which
                        the commander of the Independencia would readily be able to elicit from the
                        ship’s crew, would, in the estimation of this Government, be a practical
                        denial of justice. The Mexican Government is conceived to be justly
                        responsible to this for the act of that officer, and consequently the views
                        put forth by Mr. Fernandez in behalf of his Government cannot be accepted or
                        acceded to by this.</p>
                    <p>Guided by the suggestions of my former instructions in regard to the matter,
                        you will again, in the light of the observations made in this, bring the
                        subject to the attention of the minister for foreign affairs, and you will
                        say at the same time that the President hopes and expects that so just a
                        claim as this is deemed to be will receive early consideration, followed by
                        prompt and speedy adjustment at the hands of the Government of Mexico.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 13th instant I received a dispatch from
                        Joseph D. Hoff, consular agent of the United States at Coatzacoalcos (the
                        dispatch is without date), in which he informed me that H. C. Walker, a
                        citizen of the United States, was under a false accusation of having stolen
                        wood, in prison at Minatitlan, and had been confined since the 19th of
                        March, 1883, without a trial and without any proofs of guilt having been
                        brought forward against him.</p>
                    <p>Accompanying Mr. Hoff’s dispatch was the protest made by Mr. Walker before
                        that officer, a copy of which I inclose.</p>
                    <p>On the same day I addressed a note to Señor Fernandez, in which I called his
                        attention to the case, and asked for a speedy investigation thereof.</p>
                    <p>From his reply of the 17th instant you will observe that he has asked for
                        information upon the subject from the governor of the state of Vera
                        Cruz.</p>

                        <p>There is an American citizen here by the name of H. C. Walker, who has
                            been falsely accused of having stolen wood, and been a prisoner here
                            since March 19, 1883, during which time he has never been brought to
                            trial, nor has his accuser ever presented any proofs whatever against
                            him.</p>
                        <p>He is at present in jail and seriously sick, and although two physicians
                            here have examined him and given their certificates that his life is in
                            imminent danger if longer detained in jail, and that it is impossible to
                            cure him where he is confined, the judge here has refused to permit him
                            to leave the jail to get cured, although he has been offered hail to any
                            amount he required to present himself for trial whenever required by
                            said <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0461"/>judge to do so, and it
                            appears that the judge keeps him in jail because of his personal enmity
                            to said Walker, who has accused said judge to the superior court of this
                            state of injustice.</p>
                        <p>Accompanying this, I send you a copy of Walker’s protest made before

                            Coatzacoalcos and dependencies thereof, on this 29th day of February, A.
                            D. 1884, at Minatitlan, protesting as follows: <list>

                                <item>That he, the said Walker, is now, and has been since 19th day
                                    of March, A. D. 1883, a prisoner, and is now confined in jail
                                    and under arrest, without trial and only upon accusation, no
                                    proof of his guilt having been produced or offered, and that he
                                    is still so confined without bail or mainprise.</item>

                                    punishment than has been applied to convicted murderers who have
                                    been incarcerated in the same prison at the same time with
                                    himself.</item>

                                <item>That the court by whose order he has been so confined has been
                                    guilty of the grossest partiality, in that, although bail has
                                    been offered, in any amount desired, for his temporary release,
                                    the said court has refused to admit him to bail, although it is
                                    a notorious fact that a convicted murderer has been admitted to
                                    bail by said court, and is now at large.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>That the said court has been guilty of great injustice and
                                    disregard of the laws of the country, in that, although
                                    protestor has repeatedly applied for a hearing of his case, no
                                    such hearing or trial has been granted by said court.</item>

                                    the certificates of two well-known and competent physicians,
                                    which are hereunto attached), which render it necessary, for the
                                    preservation of his life, that he should be removed from his
                                    present prison where he occupies a cell in common with, at
                                    times, upwards of fifty other prisoners, to some place where he
                                    can receive the care, quiet, and attention which his condition
                                    demands.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Admission to his presence has been denied to his wife, as also permission
                            to furnish him with proper food and medicines.</p>
                        <p>Against all of which acts of arrest, restraint, punishment, and
                            partiality and injustice of court, the said Walker protests; and I,
                            Joseph D. Hoff, consular agent of the United States of America for
                            Coatzacoalcos and dependencies, having myself seen said Walker, and
                            recognizing the injustice and inhumanity of his treatment, do also
                            protest that his confinement is an outrage against humanity and common

                        <p>In due course this department received your official communication of the
                            18th of February last, in which was inclosed the translation of a note
                            which the minister of the United States of America in behalf of his
                            Government addressed to your department asking for the pardon of Capt.
                            George Caleb, who was sentenced by the Mexican tribunals to five years’
                            imprisonment for the offense of smuggling.</p>
                        <p>These notes, as well as the one addressed to me by you in reply to the
                            one which in conformity with the circular of the 31st of January, 1871,
                            was made on the 29th of January of the present year, were submitted to
                            the consideration of the chief of the judicial section of this
                            department, who had under consideration, and for the same object,
                            Caleb’s application for pardon, as well as the petition subsequently
                            presented in his name by the American citizen, Arthur P. Cushing, to the
                            effect that the pardon being denied a commutation of his sentence might
                            be granted.</p>
                        <p>As far back as the 1st of December of last year the chief of the bureau
                            had concluded that nothing could be determined in respect of Caleb’s
                            petition, as it was not accompanied by the conditions of the law, and
                            because there was no reason nor faculty to dispense with them in
                            accordance with the requirements which have been always exacted in all
                            similar cases which have been presented.</p>
                        <p>The first of these requirements consists in a copy of the sentence
                            pronounced against the petitioner, because, according to article 284 of
                            the penal code, no pardons can be granted except upon a sentence imposed
                            by a final judgment, and this condition of things was not and has not
                            been stated to exist, although he has always been in possession of a
                            copy of the judgment. The other requirements of the case, to conform
                            with article 287 of the penal code, are: <list>
                                <label>I.</label>
                                <item>That the prisoner should have served two-fifths of the
                                    sentence pronounced against him;</item>
                                <label>II.</label>
                                <item>That during that time his conduct has been good;</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">and in neither of these categories is Caleb.</p>
                        <p>In reference to the commutation of sentence asked for by Mr. Cushing and
                            subsequently by telegraph by Caleb, the chief of the section meets with
                            the same legal difficulties which apply to the pardon, because there was
                            not, even then, presented a copy of the sentence, and article 240 of the
                            code provides: That no reduction or commutation of a penalty can be made
                            except by the executive power, <hi rend="italic">and after it has been
                                irrevocably pronounced</hi> (after final judgment).</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cushing, pursuaded of the necessity of removing these difficulties,
                            presented another application on the 14th of the present month, in which
                            he said that a copy of the sentence pronounced against Caleb was in the
                            department of hacienda, and he requested that it might be added to the
                            record. With the view of facilitating the proceedings, his request was
                            at once complied with, and within the shortest delay the minister of
                            hacienda sent a copy of the judgment pronounced against Caleb on the
                            16th of April of last year by the district court of Lower California;
                            but this judgment was not the one which the law required, as it was not
                            a final one, as is established by the fact that it had been appealed
                            against and was pending before the circuit court of Culiacan, from which
                            it resulted that matters remained in the condition that they were in
                            before the copy was received.</p>
                        <p>These circumstances show that the delay in the matter under consideration
                            is not attributable to this department, but are due exclusively to the
                            fact that the application made here was not made in conformity with the
                            positive requirements of the penal code, which do not on this point
                            innovate upon the old principle that applications for pardon to
                            individuals should not be made, except in cases where a sentence has
                            been pronounced which can be executed.</p>
                        <p>Having transmitted to you the communication addressed to Mr. Cushing,
                            asking for the judgment, you occupied yourself with the matter, and,
                            animated by the desire to expedite a decision of the Executive, you sent
                            me on the 19th of the present month a copy of the judgments rendered by
                            the district court of Lower California on the proceedings had against
                            the American schooner Adriana, and in the criminal incident <pb n="365"
                                xml:id="pg_365" facs="0465"/>against the captain of said vessel, a
                            copy of the judgment of the circuit court of Culiacan, and a copy of the
                            judgment of the same tribunal refusing the application for a rehearing
                            applied for by Caleb’s counsel. This was a compliance with the first
                            requirement of the law, and authorized a study of the question.</p>
                        <p>From the report made by the section it appears that George Caleb was
                            tried before the competent tribunals of the Republic in strict
                            conformity with the laws, the accused having availed himself of all the
                            rights guaranteed to him thereby, and that on the 30th of July; 1883,
                            sentence was pronounced against him condemning him to five years’
                            imprisonment, counting from the day when he was declared a prisoner as
                            responsible for the offense of smuggling. These facts established, the
                            section, considering the text of the code is of the opinion that George
                            Caleb can be granted neither a pardon nor a commutation of the sentence
                            pronounced upon him, except in the sense of modifying the circumstances
                            which are incompatible with his age and the state of his health.</p>
                        <p>The fundamental principles upon which this opinion rests are the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>That article 287 of the penal code, permits an unconditional pardon when
                            he who solicits it has rendered important services to the nation: when
                            the President is of opinion that it will tend to the preservation of the
                            public tranquillity or security; or when it appears that the party
                            condemned is innocent.</p>
                        <p>In other cases, under the following requisites: When the prisoner has
                            served two-fifths of his sentence; when, during that term, his conduct
                            has been continuously good and his reform complete in the form required,
                            and that he has complied with his civil responsibility, giving security
                            that he will not become absolutely insolvent; and as Caleb, as has been
                            said, has not established that he comes under either of the conditions
                            of said article, it is evident that a pardon cannot be granted to
                            him.</p>
                        <p>As regards the commutation, the article 242 of the code establishes the
                            rules which are to be observed in order to grant it, and the only one
                            applicable to the case when the sentence is one of imprisonment is found
                            in Section IV of said article, which says: <hi rend="italic">Only when
                                from any circumstance the punishment is incompatible with the age,
                                sex, health, or physical constitution of the prisoner the
                                circumstances may be modified</hi>. And when Caleb shall allege and
                            prove by the certificate of two competent parties that the climate in
                            which he finds himself will be fatal to him (extinguendo la pena), is
                            detrimental to his health, this circumstance may be modified by allowing
                            him to come to this capital or to go some other place of the
                            Republic.</p>
                        <p>The President considering that in effect George Caleb has rendered no
                            important services to the nation; that there is no ground to believe
                            that his pardon would be conducive to the public tranquillity or
                            security, but on the contrary, that the impunity of crime would
                            compromise the public tranquillity and security, particularly of crimes
                            which affect the public revenues; that the prisoner does not appear to
                            be innocent, and that according to his petition for pardon he is
                            convicted of and confesses to having committed the offense for which he
                            has been condemned; and, lastly, that the prisoner has not completed
                            two-fifths of his sentence—refuses the pardon for the powerful reason
                            that he has no power to grant it, and considers that the dispositions of
                            the code upon the subject of the commutation of the sentence limits the
                            concession thereof to modifying the circumstances of the imprisonment to
                            the condition most favorable to the health of the prisoner.</p>
                        <p>To more fully appreciate the order in Caleb’s case, it appears proper to
                            state that the constitution of the United States of Mexico does not vest
                            in the President the discretionary power to pardon, but restricts it,
                            and declares that it can only be done in conformity with the law, which
                            is clearly shown in fraction xv, article 85, of said constitution, which
                            is not drawn up in the fall and unconditional terms used in the
                            respective Section II, Article II, of the Constitution of the United
                            States of America.</p>
                        <p>The law which governs the President, in compliance with the fraction of
                            the constitution cited, is the penal code of the federal district and
                            territory of Lower California upon offenses at common law, and in all of
                            the Republic upon offenses against the federation; and it has been
                            abundantly established that according to that law the executive cannot
                            grant a pardon in the case of George Caleb.</p>
                        <p>The President would have been well pleased if it had been possible for
                            him to have decided otherwise, and to have granted the pardon asked for,
                            as well because it would have been in conformity with his acknowledged
                            sentiments in favor of clemency, as because it would have furnished him
                            with an opportunity of giving another proof of the friendship which he
                            feels for the United States, whose active intervention in this matter
                            has been considered with the respect and consideration which it
                            deserves; but within the circle of his legal attributes he has been
                            obliged to govern his conduct by his duty.</p>
                        <p>All of which, by order of the President, and in answer to the
                            communications referred to, I have the honor to inform you of, that it
                            may have its corresponding effect.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: My dispatch No. 773, 21st March last, and its
                        inclosures, informed you of the steps I had taken to procure an
                        investigation of the case of Howard C. Walker, charged by the Mexican
                        authorities at Minatitlan with having stolen wood.</p>
                    <p>I have now to report to you that on the 15th of May last I received a letter
                        from Mr. Walker, dated the 3d of that month, in which he stated his case to
                        me and asked for such assistance as it might be in my power to render him.
                        To this letter I replied on the 16th.</p>
                    <p>Señor Fernandez not having furnished me the information he said he had asked
                        for from the governor of Vera Cruz (see inclosure 4 in my dispatch No. 773),
                        and as Mr. Walker’s case, as stated by him, appeared to me to be a
                        particularly hard one, I addressed another note to Señor Fernandez on the
                        15th of May, 1884, reiterating the request contained in my note to him of
                        the 13th March last (inclosure 3 in No. 773).</p>
                    <p>On the 31st May I received Señor Fernandez’s reply (28th May), a copy and
                        translation of which I inclose.</p>
                    <p>Señor Fernandez states that he had asked for information from the governor of
                        the State of Vera Cruz, who, in turn, had made inquiries of the superior
                        court, but he does not state that the governor has been able, as yet, to
                        furnish him with any information in the case.</p>
                    <p>He further states that while he has made these inquires in this as in other
                        cases which I have brought to his notice, in compliance with my request,
                        with the view of bringing to the knowledge of the courts the irregularities
                        charged therein, it must not be implied therefrom that he has done so under
                        any authority of his department to supervise the action of the courts in
                        judicial proceedings which relate to private individuals, because of the
                        independence of the public powers, Federal and State.</p>
                    <p>And as regards Walker, he informs me that as he does not appear to have been
                        matriculated at the foreign office as a citizen of the United States, he
                        will be prevented from admitting any future official intervention in his
                        behalf.</p>
                    <p>Since my note to Señor Mariscal, of the 25th of September, 1882, written
                        under instructions contained in your No. 298, 24th of July, 1882, I have
                        several times called the attention of the Mexican Government to cases of
                        citizens of the United States held in confinement in the prisons of Mexico,
                        and asked for investigation and speedy trials, to none of which has
                        objection been made to my interposition on the ground that they were not
                        matriculated. I had therefore hoped, as my note of the 25th of September,
                        1882, has never been answered, that the Mexican Government had abandoned
                        that untenable position. It appears that I have been mistaken. Señor
                        Fernandez occupies it again.</p>
                    <p>Unless otherwise instructed I shall pay no attention to Señor Fernandez’s
                        suggestion that he will not accept the intervention of this legation in Mr.
                        Walker’s behalf should he need it, but will act under the opinion expressed
                        by you in your dispatch No. 298, above referred to.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: My name has been previously presented to
                            you by Capt. J. H. Hoff, consular agent at Coatzacoalcos, in connection
                            with the affair of the Norwegian bark Circassian. I am an American
                            citizen, resident of Saint Louis, Mo. My father, Col. Leo D. Walker; my
                            relations there, whom you undoubtedly know—uncles, Samuel B. Churchill
                            and Francis T. Bryan; other members of my family, the Schaumbergs,
                            Smaringins, Goods, Wash, Clarks, and Taylors of the old Taylor
                            homestead. United States Senator Blackburn is a connection of mine;
                            Senators Hampton and Butler warm and intimate friends of my mother’s
                            family, the Turnbulls of South Carolina. I, for the past two years, have
                            been shipping or river clerk for Mr. R. H. Leetch, of this place, the
                            heaviest mahogany merchant in the Republic, and in pursuance of my
                            legitimate business shipped on board the bark Circassian, together with
                            other timber, some hundred and odd logs of mahogany, which I afterwards
                            learned were claimed by one Jose” B. Teran, but all bearing the brand of
                            Mr. Leetch and undoubtedly his property. The ship has been discharged by
                            order of the tribunal and not one log was found with the mark claimed by
                            said Teran, yet from pure maliciousness I am still held a prisoner. I
                            thought no more of the matter until suddenly one day, the 19th of March,
                            1883, while discharging my duties as clerk, I was arrested and thrown
                            into a miserable prison, and an accusation or charge brought against me
                            for robbery of timber.</p>
                        <p>I became very ill with fever, and was taken out of prison and sent to my
                            house. After my recovery nothing more was said to me until the 12th of
                            February last, when I was again arrested on the same charge and again
                            thrown into prison, where I have remained, and from whence I am now
                            writing. Confined here with the most reckless class of criminals, lepers
                            and Indians, with all classes of diseases, I have once come near dying,
                            and am still in wretched health. Mr. Leetch has offered to give any
                            amount of bond required for me, but it is refused. The judges are ail
                            acting in the most illegal and extraordinary manner, and are men of
                            utter irresponsibility, who, outside of their clique have not the
                            respect of the most ignominious Indian. I have formally accused them all
                            before the tribunal. I feel that I am the subject of a deliberate
                            conspiracy, planned to satisfy private malice. Innocent of the
                            accusation brought against me, my character having been hitherto
                            untarnished, and after being a prisoner for more than fourteen months
                            without trial, and a determination being evident not to allow me one,
                            and seeing no end of this matter in the near future, I make a positive
                            and urgent appeal to you, as my minister, to take immediate telegraphic
                            action to secure my liberty and rights as an American citizen, for I
                            will die in this horrible prison, which, from its crowded and unhealthy
                            condition can be truthfully compared to the Black Hole of Calcutta.</p>
                        <p>I ask only a faithful and <hi rend="italic">prompt</hi> execution of the
                            laws of the country, which would set me free, and I appeal to you as the
                            representative of our nation to afford me the assistance which is in
                            your power, and which I feel sure you would have sooner extended had you
                            been fully cognizant of the facts of the case.</p>
                        <p>Awaiting your reply before taking further steps, I am, &amp;c.,</p>

                            yesterday.</p>
                        <p>Consular Agent Hoff’s undated dispatch, which I received on the 15th of
                            March last, was the first intimation made to me of your arrest and
                            imprisonment. On the same day that I received his dispatch I called the
                            attention of the Mexican Government to your case, and asked for a speedy
                            investigation thereof.</p>
                        <p>The secretary for foreign relations replied, on the. 17th March, that he
                            had asked for information upon the subject from the governor of the
                            State of Vera Cruz. On the receipt of your letter of the 3d instant, I
                            addressed another note to the foreign office, again asking that you be
                            afforded a speedy trial, of all of which I informed Mr. Hoff on the 21st

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 15th March last I called your
                            honor’s attention to the case of Howard C. Walker, a citizen of the
                            United States, who had been arrested on the 19th of March, 1883, by the
                            Mexican authorities at Minatitlan (or Coatzacoalcos), and who was, at
                            the date of my note, still in prison upon the charge of having stolen
                            some lumber. I asked that prompt investigation be had of his case in
                            order that, if innocent of the charge under which he was held in
                            confinement, he might be set at liberty. On the 17th of the same month
                            your honor informed me that you had asked for information respecting the
                            case from the governor of Vera Cruz. Two months have elapsed since the
                            date of your note, and I have heard nothing further from you upon the
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>In the meanwhile I have received a letter from Mr. Walker, dated the 3d
                            instant, in which he informs me that he is still in prison. Mr. Walker
                            states that as the shipping agent of Mr. R. H. Leetch he had shipped on
                            the Norwegian bark Circassian some mahogany logs; that these logs were
                            claimed by Mr. José R. Teran; that the vessel was discharged of her
                            cargo by order of the tribunal of the district, and that none of the
                            logs were marked as claimed by Mr. Teran.</p>
                        <p>The date at which the circumstance took place I have not been told, but
                            on the 19th of March, 1883, Mr. Walker was arrested, as above stated,
                            and thrown into prison. He fell ill and was sent to his own house. After
                            his recovery nothing was said to him until the 12th of February last,
                            when he was again arrested upon the same charge and again sent to
                            prison, where he now is “confined,” as he says, “with all classes of
                            criminals, lepers and Indians, with all classes of diseases.” He informs
                            me that since his second arrest he has been once near the point of
                            death, and that he is still in wretched health. He has offered to give
                            bond pending the proceedings -against him, but his offer has been
                            declined.</p>
                        <p>What Mr. Walker asks is a faithful and prompt execution of the laws of
                            Mexico. And this, I think, it must be admitted he is entitled to. It is,
                            therefore, my duty to again call your honor’s attention to Mr. Walker’s
                            case, and to claim for him the speedy trial to which he is entitled.</p>

                            alleged have been committed in Walker’s case, the department under my
                            charge considered it proper to take that step, as it has taken it in
                            other similar cases which your excellency has brought to its notice, but
                            without implying the faculty or the possibility of this department to
                            supervise the judicial proceedings which affect particular individuals,
                            by reason of ‘ the independence of the public powers into which the
                            Government, Federal as well as State, is directed.</p>
                        <p>I consider it the more necessary to make this explanation to your
                            excellency in respect of your note relating to Walker, of the 15th
                            instant, inasmuch as it does not appear from matriculation register that
                            that individual is a citizen of the United States, a circumstance which
                            prevents me from accepting the ulterior official intervention of your
                            excellency in the matter.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatch No. 820, of the 2d instant, has
                        been received. It presents the case of Howard C. Walker, an American
                        citizen, arrested and imprisoned at Minatitlan, the 19th of March last,
                        charged with having stolen some lumber.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Walkers statement to you is that for the past two years he has been
                        shipping or river clerk for Mr. R. H. Leetch, of Minatitlan, the heaviest
                        mahogany merchant in Mexico, and that in pursuance of his, Walker’s,
                        legitimate business, he shipped on board the bark Circassian, together with
                        other timber, some hundred and odd logs of mahogany which, as afterwards
                        learned, were claimed by one José R. Teran, but all bearing the brands of
                        Mr. Leetch, and undoubtedly his property. The ship,” continued Mr. Walker,
                        “has been discharged by order of the tribunal and not one log was found with
                        the mark claimed by said Teran, yet, from pure maliciousness, I (Walker) am
                        still held a prisoner.”</p>
                    <p>You accordingly presented Mr. Walker’s case to the Mexican Government, asking
                        for a speedy investigation thereof. Mr. Fernandez advises you, in reply,
                        that, as a matter of courtesy, he will obtain information upon the subject,
                        but admonishes you that, Mr. Walker not having been registered at the
                        foreign office, diplomatic intervention in his (Walker’s) behalf will not in
                        future be admitted.</p>
                    <p>Like yourself, I confess to not a little surprise that the Mexican Government
                        should have again resorted to so untenable a ground as that herein advanced,
                        especially, too, in view of the fact, which you state, that since your note
                        to Mr. Mariscal of September 25, 1882, based upon my instruction of July 24,
                        1882, No. 298, wherein the question of matriculation was fully discussed,
                        you have had occasion to repeatedly call the attention of the Mexican
                        Government to cases of American citizens imprisoned in Mexico, with a view
                        of securing an investigation and speedy trial, and in not one of which has
                        objection been made to your interposition on the ground that the accused
                        person had not matriculated.</p>
                    <p>In that instruction you were told that this Government declined to recognize
                        the pretension of Mexico to limit the diplomatic intervention in behalf of
                        abused citizens of the United States in Mexico, to those cases in which the
                        injured person had been registered or matriculated, and that the inherent
                        right of such citizen to demand of his Government and its duty to afford him
                        such protection as was possible in a foreign land could not be controlled or
                        abridged by a Mexican municipal statute.</p>
                    <p>Your action and conclusion in respect of Mr. Walker’s case is therefore
                        approved. Until Mexico shall meet our argument as to matriculation on such
                        basis as this Government may accept, with due regard to its constitutional
                        and international right to protect its citizens abroad, you will continue to
                        ignore the Mexican contention that a failure to matriculate necessarily
                        debars a citizen of the United States from the assistance of its diplomatic
                        representative at the Mexican capital.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have again to call your honor’s
                            attention to the case of the American schooner Daylight, which, while at
                            anchor outside of the bar, near Tampico, was, in the night of the 21st
                            March, 1882, sunk by the Mexican gunboat Independencia.</p>
                        <p>The details of the case and the demand made by my Government for
                            compensation to the owners of the Daylight for the sinking of their
                            vessel by the Mexican gunboat are all set forth in the several notes
                            which I have had the honor to address to the department over which you
                            preside, and it is not necessary that I should at the present moment
                            recapitulate them.</p>
                        <p>I take up the case where your honor left it in your note of the 23d of
                            April last.</p>
                        <p>In that note your honor assumes the position that the owners of the
                            Daylight can make their direct demand on the Mexican Government before
                            the Mexican tribunals without permission; that the Mexican Government is
                            considered as a person, and as such can sue and be sued before the
                            proper tribunals; and you conclude that should the Government deem it
                            best that the matter be settled between the two Governments, the United
                            States minister and the Mexican department of foreign affairs will be
                            the medium through which the setlement will be made, the department of
                            war and navy acting as witnesses only of the facts. And your honor adds:
                            “But it having been a practice constantly sustained by the Government
                            that a diplomatic course cannot be taken when it interferes in favor of
                            persons except in case of denial of justice, Señor Mariscal and I had
                            the honor to notify your excellency that the complainant (or
                            complainants) must himself appear before the department of war and navy,
                            regretting that such a course is necessary.” And your honor’s last
                            conclusion is that “the disaster of the Daylight having occurred in
                            Mexican waters, the Mexican tribunals are the proper ones to hear this
                            case as well as any other which treats of the defining of civil or
                            criminal responsibility, and decide what grade or form of responsibility
                            must be laid upon the delinquents in the deplorable case.”</p>
                        <p>This note was transmitted by you to the Department of State at
                            Washington, and the Secretary of State informs me that “upon a careful
                            examination of these several propositions of the distinguished secretary
                            for foreign relations of Mexico, I find myself wholly unable to agree
                            with him in the conclusion that the doctrine embraced in them can, with
                            any legal propriety, be considered applicable to the case of the
                            Daylight.”</p>
                        <p>In your honor’s note to me of the same date, in respect of the steamer
                            Sidbury, you say: “This opinion does not merely rest upon the principle
                            that the courts are called upon to redress injuries which are “suffered
                            by the inhabitants of the country or those who are transiently therein,
                            for the purpose for which they are established is to administer
                            justice.”</p>
                        <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0471"/>
                        <p>Giving to this proposition the interpretation which it has received from
                            all writers on public law, and hitherto accepted by all civilized
                            Governments, that is, that the municipal civil laws of any country can
                            only be held applicable to, and operative in, the rights, property, and
                            persons of the citizens of the country and foreigners who may be either
                            permanently or temporarily residing in the country, the position may be
                            admitted.</p>
                        <p>This, however, is all that can be claimed for it, and, as it is believed,
                            it is all that is claimed for it by the Governments of Christian
                            nations, and all that is allowed to it by the uniform declarations of
                            writers on public law. “Considered,” says Halleck, “in an international
                            point of view, either the thing or the person made the subject of the
                            jurisdiction must be within the territorial limits so as to subject
                            either persons or property to its judicial decisions, and every exertion
                            of authority of its sort beyond its limits is a mere nullity and
                            incapable of binding such persons or property in any other
                            tribunal.”</p>
                        <p>The same doctrine is found stated in different forms of expression in
                            Phillimore, in Wheaton, in Westlake, and in Woolsey. I am not aware that
                            it has ever been questioned.</p>
                        <p>The owners of the Daylight were never residents of Mexico, either
                            permanently or temporarily. They are not known to have ever been in this
                            country. The master of the vessel was not a resident of Mexico, either
                            permanent or temporary, and was never in the country beyond the point at
                            which his vessel might touch. At the time of the occurrence which gave
                            rise to the claim, the vessel could scarcely be said with strict
                            propriety to have been in Mexican waters. She was anchored outside the
                            bar near the harbor of Tampico, in an exceptionally rough sea, at the
                            close of a severe storm, which rendered it unsafe for her to attempt to
                            cross the bar or enter the harbor. To insist that these claimants shall
                            go from Maine to Tampico to seek redress in the Mexican tribunals for a
                            grievous wrong suffered at the hands of a high officer of the navy of
                            that Republic would, in the estimation of my Government, be a practical
                            denial of justice. The Mexican Government is, in the opinion of my
                            Government, conceived to be justly responsible to it for the act of that
                            officer, and consequently the views put forth by your honor in behalf of
                            your Government cannot be accepted by mine.</p>
                        <p>I therefore again bring the case to the consideration of your honor, and
                            I have been instructed to say at the same time that the President of the
                            United States hopes and expects that so just a claim as this is deemed
                            to be will receive early consideration, followed by prompt and speedy
                            adjustment at the hands of the Government of Mexico.</p>
                        <p>I renew, &amp;c.,</p>

                            Caleb deserted the private house wherein he was confined, committing a
                            breach of parole, under which custody he had been kept before and after
                            he was sentenced to suffer the penalty of five years of imprisonment,
                            leaving the said house (from information acquired from outside circles)
                            on the night of the date above mentioned, when he absconded on board of

                            he was conveyed to Guaymas, and that he there took the railroad train

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: By instruction No. 550, of the 23d of April
                        last, you were acquainted with a dispute then lately arisen concerning the
                        legitimate jurisdiction over certain islands in the Rio Grande (Rio Bravo)
                        near Roma, Tex., and you were directed to present the matter to the Mexican
                        Government and ask consideration of our just claim to jurisdiction in the
                        premises.</p>
                    <p>Since then, the Mexican Government has made, through Señor Romero, under date
                        of June 12 last, a counter complaint, claiming Morteritos Island as Mexican
                        territory, with its accretions, and protesting against any attempt on the
                        part of the United States to exercise authority over that island.</p>
                    <p>The note of Mr. Romero and its inclosures, being very voluminous and not yet
                        wholly translated, could not be sent to you herewith without involving
                        inconvenient delay. Copies will, however, go to you as soon as possible, to
                        complete your record.</p>
                    <p>The question appearing to be one of simple fact, to be settled by the records
                        of the Boundary Commission, under the signatures of both commissioners, now
                        on file in this Department, I requested the Secretary of War to direct Brig.
                        Gen. W. H. Emory, U. S. Army, the United States commissioner on the original
                        survey, to examine the records and charts thereof. General Emory has done
                        so, Señor Romero having had at the same time opportunity to personally
                        inspect the records and charts. The general’s report removes all ground for
                        doubt that Morteritos belongs to the United States, under the prescriptions
                        of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.</p>
                    <p>I have accordingly replied to the Mexican contention by a note<note n="*"
                            xml:id="d265fn1">For inclosure see document No. 266 <hi rend="italic"
                                >post.</hi></note> to Señor Romero, of which I inclose a copy for
                        your information.</p>
                    <p>The question would appear to have been in part founded on a case of mistaken
                        identity, in assuming that two small twin islands below and near to Roma,
                        and separated at the time of the survey by a shallow water course now
                        believed to be filled up, were the Morteritos and Sabinos Islands of the
                        Mexican contention and identical with islands Nos. 12 and 13. It seems clear
                        that Sabinitos (or Sabinos) is a large single island, lying some distance
                        above Roma, and is acknowledged Mexican territory both by the records of the
                        survey and in the absence, so far as known here, of any occasion for dispute
                        in respect thereof. Island No. 12, to which Señor Romero refers in one of
                        his notes on the subject, lies lower down the river, near Ringgold Barracks,
                        is styled on the survey charts Green Key Island, and likewise appears to
                        belong to Mexico without dispute.</p>
                    <p>It is apparently in respect only of the small twin islands, known on charts
                        both as “Beaver Islands” and as “Island No. 13,” that any dispute exists.
                        The larger of these, lying nearest to the Mexican shore, appears to be known
                        to the Mexicans as “Morteritos.” The other smaller island of the pair may or
                        may not be locally known as “Sabinos.” It bears no separate name on the
                        charts. The fact is, however, wholly immaterial, for both the islands are by
                        the two commissioners assigned to the United States.</p>
                    <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0474"/>
                    <p>After reading my note to Señor Romero and familiarizing yourself with the
                        ground therein taken, you will seek a conference with the Mexican secretary
                        for foreign affairs on the subject. You will point out to him that under
                        whichever aspect it be viewed, whether as resting on a change in the deepest
                        channel subsequent to the assignment of the survey, or on the allegiance of
                        the reputed Mexican owners of the land and on any agreement among them of
                        which the Mexican courts may have taken cognizance, the Mexican claim is
                        completely at variance with the ground taken by the Mexican Government
                        itself, that the boundary fixed by the survey is definitive, and not to be
                        changed. You may advert to the proposal made to this Government by Mr.
                        Romero (in a note dated 31st May), to review the negotiation proposed in
                        1875 by Señor Mariscal to Mr. Fish for a convention to settle boundary
                        disputes growing out of changes in the channel of the Bravo by declaring
                        that no such change shall affect the actual boundary fixed by the survey,
                        and you may observe that this Government can hardly be expected to attach
                        much weight to that proposition if, in the first case of dispute arising,
                        the Mexican Government is found to adopt a diametrically opposed theory. You
                        may also find it convenient to advert to the circumstance, shown by the
                        inclosures to my No. 550, that the Mexican owners claim the subsequent
                        accretions to Morteritos as belonging to them, and, consequently, to the
                        territorial jurisdiction of Mexico also, and comment on its untenable
                        character; for even if Morteritos Island were Mexican territory, which the
                        record of the survey shows it is not, the annexation of United States
                        territory by accretion or by change of channel could not be recognized.</p>
                    <p>You will further point out that in this contention we have the right to deem
                        ourselves the aggrieved party. The Mexican authorities at Mier have assumed
                        to exercise territorial jurisdiction, not merely over the island of
                        Morteritos, but over part of the territory of the United States which has
                        since accidentally been joined to that island by the closing of a waterway.
                        Our effort to assert the jurisdictional power belonging to us of right, has
                        been resented as an unwarrantable interference and made the occasion of a
                        complaint which proves to be baseless. Notwithstanding this, the Government
                        of the United States promptly acceded to a request of the Mexican minister,
                        and directed its authorities on the frontier to avoid all pretext of
                        conflict with the Mexican authorities until the question of ownership should
                        be amicably settled. In communicating to the Secretaries of the Treasury and
                        of War the conclusion of this Government that Morteritos is wholly of the
                        domain of the United States, the request that the officers of this
                        Government in that quarter should continue to avoid forcible assumption of
                        jurisdiction has been renewed.</p>
                    <p>Under all these circumstances, you will formally ask that the Mexican
                        Government forthwith cease any claim to territorial jurisdiction over the
                        island of Morteritos, and cause to be duly respected the boundary line to
                        the south of that island, and between it and the Mexican bank, as determined
                        by the United States and Mexican commissioners in the survey.</p>
                    <p>Upon the removal of this question from the field of debate, this Government
                        will have pleasure in taking up and considering Señor Mariscal’s original
                        proposal, now revived by Señor Romero, for negotiating a formal convention
                        in settlement of like disputes in future.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                        dispatch, No. 609, July 11, 1884, in regard to a dispute concerning the
                        legitimate jurisdiction over certain islands in the Rio Grande near Roma,
                        Tex., and in which I was instructed, to “formally ask that the Mexican
                        Government forthwith cease any claim to territorial jurisdiction over the
                        islands of Morteritos, and cause to be duly respected the boundary line to
                        the south of that island and between it and the Mexican bank, as determined
                        by the United States and Mexican commissioners in the survey.”</p>
                    <p>I was unable to obtain an interview with Señor Fernandez until the 31st
                        ultimo.</p>
                    <p>I then informed him that, as he was aware, a question had lately arisen
                        between our respective Governments concerning the legitimate jurisdiction
                        over certain islands in the Rio Grande (Rio Bravo) near Roma, Tex., and the
                        principal contention, and the one to which I would at present confine
                        myself, was the island of “Morteritos,” the Mexican Government claiming that
                        that island with its accretions belongs to Mexico, while the United States
                        contends that the island, or what was the island, forms part of the
                        territory of the United States.</p>
                    <p>I said that the boundary commissioners appointed under the treaty of
                        Guadalupe Hidalgo placed this island within the jurisdiction of the United
                        States, and that it having been joined by accretion to the north bank of the
                        river, Mexico claimed not only the island but the accretion referred to, and
                        that the Mexican authorities at Mier had assumed to exercise a jurisdiction
                        not merely over the island but over that part of the territory of the United
                        States which has since been accidentally joined to that island (Morteritos)
                        by the closing of a waterway.</p>
                    <p>I further said that the efforts of the United States to assert jurisdictional
                        power belonging to them of right has been resented as an unwarrantable
                        interference and made the occasion of a complaint by Mexico which proves to
                        be baseless. Notwithstanding this, however, the Government of the United
                        States promptly acceded to a request of <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376"
                            facs="0476"/>the Mexican minister at Washington, and directed its
                        authorities on the frontier to avoid all pretext of conflict with the
                        Mexican authorities until the question of ownership should be amicably
                        settled, and that even now in communicating to the Secretaries of the
                        Treasury and of War the conclusion arrived at by the United States
                        Government that the island was wholly the domain of the United States, the
                        request had been again renewed that the officers of the Government in that
                        quarter should continue to avoid forcible assumption of jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>I further said that the Mexican claim to jurisdiction appeared to rest upon
                        two grounds: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>A scientific report of the engineer, Garfias, dated 16th April,
                                1880, which argues that the present deepest channel to the northward
                                must always have been the deepest (and thereupon under the treaty of
                                Guadalupe Hidalgo the boundary line between the two countries) in
                                pursuance of an observed peculiarity of views by which the deepest
                                flow of water follows the hollow of a curve in the river bed.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Ownership by Mexican citizens, and an agreement among said owners
                                in March, 1874, whereby the island of Morteritos and its accretions
                                were confirmed to them under the authority of Mexico.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>I informed Señor Fernandez that the second of these points must be dismissed
                        from consideration, as the Government of the United States did not admit the
                        right of owners of land to transfer under color of any judicial agreement
                        whatever the territorial domain over their estates to the jurisdiction and
                        sovereignty of the nation to whom such individuals owe allegiance.</p>
                    <p>I then said that this reduced the question to one of simple fact, namely, the
                        ascertainment of the boundary channel fixed by the commissioners under the
                        treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. This, I said, as I had remarked before, was
                        done by the said commissioners, they having placed the island, at the time
                        of the survey, within the jurisdiction of the United States.</p>
                    <p>I informed Señor Fernandez that I had been instructed to formally ask that
                        his Government forthwith cease any claim to territorial jurisdiction over
                        the island of Morteritos, and cause to be duly respected the boundary line
                        to the south of that island and between it and the Mexican bank, as
                        determined by the United States and Mexican commissioners in the survey.</p>
                    <p>I said to Señor Fernandez that on the 31st May last Señor Romero, the Mexican
                        minister at Washington, had proposed to you to revive the proposed
                        negotiations made by Señor Mariscal to Mr. Fish in the year 1875 for a
                        convention to settle boundary disputes growing out of changes in the channel
                        of the Bravo, and declaring that no such change shall affect the actual
                        boundary fixed by the survey.</p>
                    <p>I said that upon the removal of the question of the island of Morteritos from
                        the field of debate I was authorized to say that the Government of the
                        United States would have pleasure in considering Señor Mariscal’s original
                        proposition, which has lately been renewed by Señor Romero, as above stated,
                        for negotiating a formal convention for the settlement of like disputes in
                        future, but at the present moment, however, the Government of the United
                        States could hardly be expected to attach much weight to that proposition if
                        in the first case of dispute arising the Mexican Government was found to
                        adopt a diametrically opposite course.</p>
                    <p>Señor Fernandez informed me that the question of the proprietorship of the
                        island of Morteritos had been submitted to the proper Department, <pb
                            n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0477"/>and that as soon as he should
                        receive a report therefrom he would inform me of the decision thereof.</p>
                    <p>I suggested to him that as the question was one of importance I would be glad
                        to receive his reply at as early a date as possible.</p>
                    <p>Señor Fernandez requested me to transmit to him a memorandum of the interview
                        which we had had upon the subject, which I did on the day following (August
                        1, 1884,), which is substantially as reported in the foregoing.</p>
                    <p>I have seen Señor Fernandez upon several occasions since the 31st ultimo, but
                        he has said nothing to me upon the subject further than that he had received
                        no report from the Mexican authorities with reference to the island, and I
                        therefore deem it proper to let you see that I have complied with your
                        instructions.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the receipt of your dispatch No. 603, July
                        7, 1884, in regard to the case of Howard’ C. Walker, imprisoned at
                        Minatitlan, charged by the Mexican authorities at that place with having
                        stolen wood, Mr. Morgan addressed a dispatch to our consular agent at
                        Coatzacoalcos on the 19th of July, 1884, in which he requested to be
                        informed of the present condition of the case of Mr. Walker.</p>
                    <p>About the 20th of August last Mr. Albert Langner, consular agent of the
                        United States at Tehuantepec and Salina Cruz, called at the legation and
                        gave to Mr. Morgan a draft of a dispatch which he said had been given to him
                        by Mr. Hoff, our consular agent at Coatzacoalcos, and which had been
                        addressed to Mr. Hoff to Mr. Morgan on the 30th of July last. The original
                        of the dispatch in question, which Mr. Hoff said had been forwarded to the
                        legation, has never been received.</p>
                    <p>The facts connected with Mr. Walker’s case, as reported by Consular Agent
                        Hoff, appeared to Mr. Morgan to be tantamount to a denial of justice, and he
                        therefore considered it necessary to again call the attention of the Mexican
                        Government to the facts connected with the same and request that the
                        necessary steps should be taken by them to obtain for Mr. Walker a trial, or
                        in default thereof that the bond of $40,000 which had been exacted of him
                        should be annulled and he be set at liberty.</p>
                    <p>In the note which Mr. Morgan addressed to Señor Fernandez upon the subject
                        you will observe that he ignored the contention of the Mexican Government,
                        as expressed in Señor Fernandez’s note to him of the 28th of May, 1884 (see
                        inclosure 4, in Mr. Morgan’s No. 820, June 2, 1884), that diplomatic
                        intervention would not be admitted in the case of Mr. Walker, as it did not
                        appear from the register of the department for foreign affairs that Walker
                        had been matriculated as a citizen of the United States. In this connection
                        Mr. Morgan complied with the instructions contained in your dispatch, No.
                        595, June 23, 1884.</p>
                    <p>I have now to inclose a copy and translation of Señor Fernandez’s reply,
                        received to-day.</p>
                    <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0478"/>
                    <p>The under secretary of state in charge of the department for foreign affairs
                        simply calls my attention to his note to Mr. Morgan of the 28th of May last,
                        in which he informed him “that it did not appear on the register of
                        matriculation that the said Walker was a citizen of the United States, and
                        that this circumstance prevented my (his) accepting the ulterior official
                        intervention of his excellency in the premises.”</p>

                        <p>In reply to your communication of July 19, received to day, asking the
                            present condition of the case of Howard C. Walker, I beg to say that I
                            consider it <hi rend="italic">desperate</hi> for the following reasons:
                            Howard C. Walker was placed in jail on March 19, 1883, on the accusation
                            of José Teran of having stolen wood and shipped the same on hoard of
                            Norwegian hark Circassia.</p>
                        <p>Although he has repeatedly demanded a trial of his case he has never
                            received one, nor has any proof whatever been produced by Teran to
                            substantiate his charges. By an order of the court the vessel was
                            discharged during the month of March, 1883, to ascertain if any of the
                            wood claimed by Teran was on board of said bark, and after a careful
                            examination of the marks of every log, not one was found such as claimed
                            by Teran.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Walker is the shipping clerk of Mr. R. H. Leetch and put the cargo on
                            the Circassia under his order. The work was done as usual in the day
                            time, and a receipt for the timber put on board was taken by Walker from
                            the captain for Mr. R. H. Leetch. Walker was never notified by Teran or
                            by the court or by anyone that there was any claim against the wood, and
                            it was not until after he had been in jail for several days that he knew
                            the nature of the accusation against him.</p>
                        <p>As a matter of fact, the accusation is false, as was shown by the
                            official examination of the wood above spoken of, which proved it all to
                            be the property of Mr. Leetch, but this very fact has produced the
                            deplorable results against which he has already protested before me (as
                            appears by the copy of protest which I forwarded to you), for his
                            accuser, knowing that, should the case come to trial, Walker would be
                            cleared and he himself punished for making a false accusation against
                            Walker: thus he has made every effort to postpone the trial. Meantime,
                            Walker remains a prisoner under $40,000 bail, which is excessive. It was
                            not until his health was entirely broken down and his life imperiled
                            that any bail was accepted. Since he left the jail he has been confined
                            to his home, and much of the time to his bed, his lungs having been so
                            seriously affected that he is at present, and has been for some time
                            past, suffering daily from hemorrhage of the lungs.</p>
                        <p>Under the law as administered here there seems to be no hope that a trial
                            will be reached, for by taking advantage of the right to recuse the
                            judges, and putting every possible obstacle in the way of the trial, the
                            ease is no nearer completion than it was sixteen months ago. Meantime,
                            should his health improve, Mr. Walker may at any time be ordered back to
                            jail, as bail was only admitted on the account of his ill health.</p>
                        <p>The bail is clearly excessive, as the whole wood in dispute, that is,
                            what was claimed, is not worth more than $2,500 at the outside price,
                            and never was.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have again to call your honor’s
                            attention to the case of Mr. Howard C. Walker, the circumstances of
                            which are fully related in my notes to your honor of the 13th of March
                            and 15th of May, of the present year, respectively.</p>
                        <p>Since your honor’s note to me of the 15th May I have received further
                            information concerning the condition of this unfortunate man.</p>
                        <p>He was accused, as I have heretofore informed your honor, of having
                            stolen a number of logs of wood, which were said to have been laden on
                            the Norwegian vessel Circassian.</p>
                        <p>The vessel was unloaded, and no timber with the marks which it was
                            alleged Mr. Walker had stolen were found thereon.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless he was still kept in prison. His health failing, he was
                            released, and he remained at liberty for some months, when he was
                            remanded to prison, where he remained another series of months, when,
                            his health again failing him, he was released upon furnishing a bond of
                            $40,000. I am informed that the property which he is alleged to have
                            taken was never worth $2,500.</p>
                        <p>He has endeavored repeatedly to have his case tried, but in vain. The
                            authorities will do nothing. He cannot leave the country if he desired
                            to do so, because his bond would be forfeited if he did, and his friends
                            would be forced to pay $40,000.</p>
                        <p>He has been under arrest since the 19th of March, 1883, and he has never
                            been able to obtain a trial. This is tantamount to an absolute denial of
                            justice. It is even worse than this in my judgment.</p>
                        <p>It is the wanton exercise of power in the authorities under whose
                            jurisdiction he is punished for a crime which the records, as I am
                            informed, show he was never guilty of.</p>
                        <p>On the 17th of March last your honor informed me that you had asked
                            information upon the subject from the governor of Vera Cruz, and on the
                            28th of May last you informed me that that official had in his turn
                            asked for information thereof from the superior tribunal of justice of
                            that state, since when I have heard nothing from your department upon
                            the subject.</p>
                        <p>I have therefore to request that your honor’s Government will take the
                            necessary steps to secure to this citizen of the United States a trial,
                            or in default thereof that the bond exacted of him be annulled, and he
                            be set at liberty.</p>
                        <p>I renew, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have the honor to inform you
                            that I have to-day received a note from the foreign office of the United
                            Mexican States, dated Mexico, May 23 ultimo, in which I am informed that
                            according to information possessed by that office the islands of
                            Morteritos and Sabinos, referred to in my note to your Department of
                            24th May, belong to Mexico by reason of having remained when the
                            dividing line between <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0481"/>the two
                            countries was laid down in conformity with article 5 of the boundary
                            treaty of the 2d of February, 1848, on the right side of the deepest
                            channel of the river, for which reason they have since then remained in
                            the possession of Mexico, forming a part of the municipality of Mier, in
                            the State of Tamaulipas.</p>
                        <p>It is true that by reason of a recent change in the currents of the Rio
                            Bravo both of those islands are now on the left bank of the greater arm
                            and deeper channel of the river; but as, in the opinion of the Mexican
                            Government, the dividing line between the two countries is that which
                            was laid down by the mixed commission, which met in conformity with the
                            treaty of February 2, 1848, there can be no doubt with respect to the
                            legitimate ownership of those islands.</p>
                        <p>I think it unnecessary to say to you that these islands are those
                            numbered 12 and 13, of which Maj. William H. Emory, chief of the
                            boundary commission of the United States, speaks in his Report to the
                            Secretary of the Interior, dated in this city July 29, 1856, page 65,
                            volume 1.</p>
                        <p>In view of these facts, the Government of Mexico hopes that the
                            Government of the United States will recognize the right of Mexico to
                            those islands which is derived from an existing treaty between the two
                            countries, and from the demarkation of the line made in conformity with
                            the aforesaid treaty and supported by an uninterrupted possession of
                            nearly forty years.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: Referring to the notes which I
                            addressed to your Department on the 13th of March and the 24th May last,
                            and on the 2d instant, in reference to the islands of Morteritos and
                            Sabinitos, in the Rio Grande, of which Mexico has been in possession for
                            the reason that she considered them as an integral part of her
                            territory, I have the honor to inform you that I have this day received
                            from the department of foreign relations of Mexico various documents
                            showing the rights of Mexico to the said islands. I inclose a copy of
                            the principal ones of these documents and of a drawing which was sent as
                            an inclosure to the report of Engineer Garfias, of April 19, 1880,
                            together with an index showing their dates and giving a brief outline of
                            their contents.</p>
                        <p>It appears from the said documents that the aforesaid islands were to
                            remain on the right of the deepest channel of the Rio Grande, when the
                            demarkation of limits was made according to the treaties of February 2,
                            1848, and December 30, 1853, belonging consequently to Mexico, according
                            to the report of Engineer Ignacio Garfias (inclosure No. 4); that, among
                            various changes that took place in the bed of the river owing to
                            freshets in the year 1865, the island of Morteritos became united to
                            another which was quite near it, but the new island remained on the
                            right of the deepest channel of the river; that Mexicans were the owners
                            of the island contiguous to the right bank and citizens of the United
                            States the owners of the other, but that when both were <pb n="382"
                                xml:id="pg_382" facs="0482"/>united all the parties interested made
                            an agreement on the 9th of March, 1874, before the court at Mier,
                            whereby Mexicans remained in possession of the whole island, that the
                            island has been in the possession of Mexico since that time; judicial
                            acts being exercised there, such as the establishment of a section of
                            vigilance, and grain being sown by Mexican citizens; that another change
                            which took place in the deepest channel of the Rio Grande left the
                            island of Morteritos on the left side of the channel, and for this
                            reason, on the 20th of January last, several armed persons from Roma,
                            Tex., headed by W. W. Bohorman, the judge at Roma, in Starr County,
                            Texas, invaded the island of Morteritos, destroyed several inclosures,
                            drove out the Mexican owners, and divided their property among
                            themselves; and that a short time before several residents of Roma had
                            appealed to the judicial authorities of Texas, requesting them to
                            declare that the island belonged to them by accession.</p>
                        <p>I shall not now stop to speak of the incident relative to private
                            property on the island of Morteritos, which, as appears from the
                            inclosed document, was declared to belong to Doña Guadalupe Garcia,
                            according to the decision of the supreme court of justice of Mexico,
                            dated October 24, 1836, because in this note I am simply endeavoring to
                            demonstrate its nationality, that is to say, that it forms a part of the
                            territory of Mexico.</p>
                        <p>Without prejudice to the subsequent transmission to you of the report of
                            the engineer who has been sent by the Government of Mexico to the Rio
                            Grande to make a study of this subject on the spot, together with such
                            other data as I may hereafter receive from my Government, I have the
                            honor to inform you that the department of foreign, relations of the
                            United States of Mexico has informed me, by a note bearing date of the
                            28th of May last, that— <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>In the inclosed documents there are irrefutable and full data,
                                    showing unmistakably the right of eminent domain of Mexico to
                                    the island of Morteritos, among them the survey and the sounding
                                    made by our consul at Rio Grande City, the agreement made by the
                                    inhabitants of the two countries before the court at Mier with
                                    regard to the possession of the land on the island, the report
                                    of Engineer Garfias, and the fact that a section of vigilance
                                    was established on the island without any attempt having
                                    hitherto been made by the Government of the United States to
                                    exercise jurisdiction on that island or to interfere with that
                                    of the Mexican authorities.</p>

                        <p>In view of these considerations, the Government of Mexico instructs me
                            “to request that of the United States to issue the necessary orders to
                            the end that the free action of the Mexican authorities on that island
                            may not be obstructed.”</p>

                            <p>Desiring to comply, to the best of my ability, with the instructions
                                which you were pleased to communicate to me by your note No. 7,
                                dated the 9th of August last, directing me to prepare a report upon
                                the true situation, and other circumstances of an island in the Rio
                                Grande which is used as a place of refuge for smugglers, according
                                to the statement of the chief of the customs, section of Camargo, I
                                have the honor to inform you that I have been to visit the aforesaid
                                island, and to measure myself the depth of the two branches of the
                                river which form it.</p>
                            <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0483"/>
                            <p>The island is, indeed, very near to the town of Roma, opposite to the
                                Ameriean rancheria called Los Saenz on one side, and on the other
                                being opposite to the Mexican ranehes called Guardado and El
                                Morterito, which is about 2,500 meters in length, and about 200 in
                                width in its broadest part, and owing to its situation is really
                                very favorable to smuggling operations.</p>
                            <p>I measured the depth of each channel of the river fourteen times in
                                different places of its longitudinal extent, and obtained the
                                following results, which show the differences in depth.</p>
                            <p>Sounding of the northern channel, American side: 1 m., 16; 1 m., 24;
                                1 m., 47; 1 m., 51; 1 m., 72; 1 m., 78; 2 m., 35; 2 m., 70.</p>
                            <p>Sounding of the channel on the Mexican side: 0 m., 71; 0 m., 89; 0
                                m., 96; 1 m., 05; 1 m., 32; 1 m., 40; 1 m., 52.</p>
                            <p>This latter channel, according to information, sometimes becomes dry,
                                while the other always has water. From all this it appears that the
                                deeper of the two channels of the Rio Grande, which form the island,
                                is the one on the north, and according to the fifth article of the
                                treaty of friendship and limits of 1848, and article 1 of the treaty
                                of Mesilla, that the island is to be considered as a part of our
                                national territory. As to the history of the island, I have gathered
                                the following data:</p>
                            <p>The Rio Grande was formerly divided at the island into three
                                divisions or channels, one of them being central and following the
                                original direction of the river, and two being lateral and
                                separated, one towards the north and the other towards the south,
                                after which they again met, leaving between them two strips of land,
                                one of which was considered American and the other as Mexican soil,
                                their owners belonging to the two nationalities.</p>
                            <p>In the year 1865 there was a large freshet in the Rio Grande which
                                caused various changes in its current, among which was that the two
                                strips of land in again becoming united formed the present island. I
                                myself have seen marks of the former division of the island, which
                                was still very apparent, and I have passed through the former
                                channel of the river. When the two parts of the island became united
                                their various owners privately agreed to own, in equal parts, that
                                which had recently been formed. They soon disagreed, however, and
                                had recourse to the law and terminated their dispute by means of the
                                written agreement which was authenticated before the court at
                                Mier.</p>
                            <p>I had not asked the court at Mier for any information with regard to
                                the truth of this, because I did not know whether such a proceeding
                                on my part would be approved. I think, moreover, that if such a
                                document is necessary, it will be obtained more readily by your
                                department.</p>
                            <p>I must inform you, in conclusion, that I was accompanied during my
                                examination of the island by the chief of the customs section of
                                Camargo and by Don Juan Villareal, a respectable person, who is the
                                judge of the civil register at Camargo and likewise judge of the
                                supreme court of the state of Tamaulipas, and that we proceeded with
                                the utmost discretion, preferring to make our journey on the Mexican
                                side, although it was thereby rendered longer and more
                                difficult.</p>
                            <p>I renew to you the assurances of my most respectful
                                consideration.</p>

                            <p>Under date of the 18th of January last the maritime and frontier
                                custom-house at Matamoros wrote to this department as follows: The
                                chief officer of the customs-section at Camargo, by a communication
                                numbered 192, and dated the 31st of December last, wrote to this
                                custom-house as follows: I have the honor to inform you that during
                                the month just closing nothing worthy of special remark has occurred
                                in the section under my charge. Although diligent efforts have been
                                made to punish smugglers, especially in the district lying west of
                                this city, it has not been possible to arrest any of them, because,
                                as I said in my last report, those who convey their goods to the
                                interior via Roma take a westerly direction from Mier, having
                                abandoned their old route of Arroyo de San Antonio and the Aldamas
                                ranch, and making their exit near Villa de Parras, or they wait
                                until the last part of the month, and then avail themselves of the
                                absence of the dragoons who come to be reviewed. With the consent of
                                the commanding officer of the federal force, which is under my
                                control, I ordered that the party should not return this month,
                                hoping that some of the smugglers who avail themselves of this
                                temporary absence might thus be captured.</p>
                            <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0484"/>
                            <p>Of the result of my efforts I will inform the custom-house under your
                                charge. At the request of the Mexican consul at Rio Grande City (who
                                desired that we should go together to the little island that is
                                nearly opposite Roma, to which I referred in my communication of
                                June 14, No. 266), I went, in company with him, on the 24th instant,
                                for the purpose of making an examination. The said island measures
                                nearly 3 kilometers from east to west, and about 200 meters in its
                                widest part; the narrowest channel, which is on the Mexican side, is
                                1 meter and 52 centimeters deep in its deepest part. We took more
                                than twenty soundings, and found a depth of 71 centimeters—89, 96,
                                105, 132, and 152.</p>
                            <p>According to the statements made by the people at Morteritos ranch,
                                which is situated on the right bank of the river, it has but little
                                water, which is not the case in the north channel; and this is
                                understood, because we found in more than twenty, soundings, which
                                were taken in its entire length, from the western extremity of the
                                islet to the eastern, the following depths: 1 meter 16 centimeters,
                                1.24, 1.47, 1.57, 1.72, 1.78, 2.35, and 2.70; the difference between
                                the greatest depths in the two channels being 1 meter and 18
                                centimeters, and that between the smallest depths 45 centimeters.
                                The island is jointly owned by residents of both sides of the river,
                                there being two boats on the Texan side and two on the Mexican side,
                                which are engaged in carrying passengers either to the opposite bank
                                of the river or to the islet, which, as stated in my report, which
                                report occasioned the examination by the consul, “favors the
                                operations of smugglers, who can leave Roma, go to the islet, and
                                wait there until the coast is clear.” I have the honor to transmit
                                to you the foregoing (although your department has probably received
                                some communication on the subject from the “consul of Mexico at Rio
                                Grande City), in order that, as regards the joint occupation of the
                                island by Mexico and the United States, you may be pleased to adopt
                                such a decision as may be proper, and to inform this department

                            <p>In the city of Mier, on the 9th day of the month of March, 1874, the
                                citizens Luciano Muñoz, Cesareo de los Santos, Florentino Lopez,
                                Serafio Muñoz, having met together, both in their own behalf and as
                                representatives of their brothers, Simon Trevino in his own behalf,
                                and as the representative of his brothers, Vicente Vela, Wenceslao
                                Martinez, Octaviano Longoria, the three last named representing
                                their • wives and Rafael Garcia, some of them being residents of
                                Roma, Tex., and others of this city; also Francisco Canales,
                                representing his wife, Sabás Saldaña, in his own behalf, and
                                representing Jorge Garza, his brother Juan de la Garza for his wife,
                                and representing the children of the late Antonio Garza and Rafael
                                Peña Garza, as representatives of their mother, Doña Plácida Garza,
                                all of this place, for the purpose of deliberating with reference to
                                a compromise for the final settlement of the dispute which had grown
                                out of freshets in the river near the island of Morteritos, which
                                adjoins land belonging to the former. These proposed to settle the
                                difficulties, so far as they were concerned, if a piece of land was
                                sold to them, whose dimensions and price were to be fixed by
                                agreement, and when the said proposal had been accepted by the heirs
                                of the island of Morteritos, they agreed that the latter should sell
                                to the former &amp; piece of land that, being adjacent to that of
                                the latter and to the right side of Morteritos, should be, both on
                                the river’s bank and on the side which borders upon land belonging
                                to the Pẽñas, 135 paces in length, and of the following width: to
                                extend from the place where the river touches Brazo de Texas to
                                where it touches the land belonging to the Pẽñas on the line given
                                by both parties, for the sum of $80, by means of a bill of sale
                                which they would give extra-judicially for ail legal effects, thus
                                terminating the dispute wholly and forever; that the permanent lines
                                in the present agreement shall be fixed by common consent by both
                                parties interested, drawing them with a line of stakes in order to
                                avoid disputes in future; that if any lawsuit or misunderstanding
                                shall arise hereafter, the Messrs. Muñoz and associates shall help
                                in proportion to the accretions received by them (caused by the
                                freshets), to defray the expeuses and costs occasioned to the
                                Messrs. Pēñas; that after the present agreement has been signed by
                                all the parties, it shall be judicially authenticated and placed on
                                file, and for its fulfillment they pledge their property, both
                                present and future. <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0485"/>And in

                                be drawn up in the place and at the time aforementioned, signing it
                                together with Messrs. Ambrosio Gonzales and Porfirio Zamora as

                            <p>Mr. Ignacio Garfias writes to this department, under date of the 16th
                                instant:</p>
                            <p>“On my return to this capital, after having acquitted myself of the
                                commissions which you have been pleased to honor me with, it is now
                                my duty to report to you the result of each of them.</p>
                            <p>“Beginning in chronological order, I occupied myself with the
                                reconnoitering of the Rio Bravo del Norte, in that part of it which
                                is occupied by the islands near Roma. According to the tenor of the
                                communication of your department, and of the articles of the treaty
                                of Guadalupe, signed with the Government of the United States of the
                                North on the 2d of February, 1848, relative thereto, the point to be
                                ascertained is whether, in conformity with this treaty, the islands
                                are national territory or belong to the neighboring country.</p>
                            <p>“The text of the fifth article of the treaty is: ‘The dividing line
                                between the two Republics shall begin’ &amp;c. ‘It shall run in the
                                middle of said river, following the deepest part of the channel;
                                where there is more than one channel,’ &amp;c. ‘The dividing <pb
                                    n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0486"/>line that is established by
                                this article shall be religiously respected by each one of the two
                                Republics, and no variation shall ever be made to it,’ &amp;c.</p>
                            <p>“In view of these clear and definite clauses it was necessary to
                                determine not only the actual state of the channels, but also the
                                state in which they were, according to the system of the river and
                                the maps relative thereto, at the time of the drawing of the
                                limits.</p>
                            <p>“It is not, in fact, the line as it exists at any period that the
                                boundary commission recognized as the limit. In view of the constant
                                necessity of applying the articles of the treaty to all the cases
                                that may require them, they have been led to create a doctrine that
                                may be expressed in the following words:</p>
                            <p>“The original nationality (that which existed at the time of the
                                drawing of the limits) is conceded to all portions of land that
                                have, owing to some variation in the basin of the river, passed
                                subsequently from one bank to the other of the river, and only in
                                cases of criminal jurisdiction is it admitted that the authorities
                                of each country can extend their action to those portions of
                                territory that have remained on the bank that belongs to them,
                                though the nationality of those lands may be different for the
                                apprehension of delinquents of their respective countries. It has
                                been observed, in fact, in the first cases that occurred after the
                                change of embankment that the original nationality being recognized
                                and not meeting any natural obstacle, criminals would take refuge
                                there pending the formal request of extradition to arrest them. This
                                interfered with the prompt course of the tribunals, and to obviate
                                these difficulties the doctrine was established, which remaius in
                                force on all the frontier and is religiously observed by all the
                                authorities of both sides of the river. There are many cases that
                                prove the strict observance of this tacit convention. Among others I
                                shall mention one of the most notable. When the American military
                                encampment of Santa Maria was established on the bank of the river a
                                change in the basin took place on the right side, leaving on the
                                left a considerable extent of land, though between this land and the
                                encampment there has been since then no obstacle that would
                                interfere with a free access, and it has formed since then an
                                integral portion of American territory at one of its military posts.
                                As this is simply a fact caused by a case of <hi rend="italic">vis
                                    major</hi>, the right of Mexico has continued to be respected,
                                and the owners of this land continued to pay their taxes in Mexico,
                                and are subject in everything to our laws. Many other similar cases
                                are met with on both banks of the river, and in all of them the same
                                practice is observed, at least so far as the State of Tamaulipas is
                                concerned.</p>
                            <p>“In view of these facts and conformably to what the treaty
                                establishes in this respect, that no variation shall be recognized,
                                but that the limit shall remain <hi rend="italic">always</hi> the
                                one marked out by the river at the time of the drawing of the line,
                                I thought it necessary not to limit myself to determining the actual
                                state of the basin, but to deduce the locality of the deepest
                                channel at the time the plans of the dividing line were drawn,
                                taking as data the form of the river as it is found in those plans,
                                and studying and determining its character at different points from
                                its mouth to the one in question. As is known, in every river the
                                channel is formed on the concave side of the curves, the accretions
                                of soil being formed on the convex side. In the different rivers
                                that I have studied, the surveys of which may be consulted in the
                                archives of your department, there is not one single case that is
                                not conformable to this rule. It is so generally recognized in all
                                the localities where the proximity of a river allows this
                                observation to be made, even by its most ignorant inhabitants, that
                                they, in their characteristic language, use an aphorism as exact as
                                it is expressive— “<hi rend="italic">Huye de la playa y cargase al
                                    barranco</hi>” (“Avoid the playa and load up at the barranco”).
                                They call, in fact, <hi rend="italic">playa</hi> those banks formed
                                by the deposit which the waters abandon at low tide, and <hi
                                    rend="italic">barranco</hi> the accessible part of the dikes
                                that the shock of the currents is constantly undermining,
                                determining there the greatest depth. Now, then, as well by
                                observation as by the commonest rules of natural philosophy, one
                                knows that the shock of the currents is on the concave part of the
                                curves, the waters, in fact, following the direction affected by the
                                dikes that hold them, when this direction is interrupted by a curve.
                                What happens in reality is that any obstacle interposing itself so
                                as to prevent the waters from following the line drawn for them by
                                the basin, they do not change their direction unless obliged by that
                                obstacle, the shock between them producing the consequent breakings
                                of the ground. On the contrary, the waters, following the direction
                                of the tangent of the curves, remain in relative tranquility all
                                along the convex side, the deposit of all the bodies of greater
                                density dragged along by the current being produced there. In a few
                                cases fact and theory conform as well. It can be established as
                                indisputable that the channel of a river is always on the concave
                                side of the curves, and one can, deduce from this principle what the
                                deepest channel was at the time of the drawing of the limits, taking
                                as data the form given to the river in the respective plans.</p>
                            <p>“Before the bifurcation of the river that formed the little island of
                                Sabinitas the convexity was on the Mexican side; this detail leaves
                                no doubt respecting the place of the deepest channel at the time of
                                the bifurcation of the river. There is, however, the circumstance
                                that all the great curve (in which the little island is comprised,
                                as <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0487"/>well as the American
                                town called Roma) holds the concave part on the left side and the
                                convex on the right, leaving the coast on Mexican soil. It is clear
                                that the channel must have remained all along the left bank, leaving
                                the little island on the right. In corroboration of that, which
                                theory forces us to deduce, there is the fact that there exist
                                breakers at the mouth of the channel on the right, formed by solid
                                ground (pebbly conglomeration) that since its origin has prevented
                                all traffic through the right channel. It is therefore evident that
                                the only practicable channel has always been the one on the left,
                                this being consequently the frontier one, and for the same reason
                                the little island belongs to Mexican territory. As is seen by the
                                plan that I annex, the change that has occurred in the basin up to
                                date is reduced to the enlargement of the channel on the left in the
                                bifurcation, this having marked more prominently the dike in that
                                part, and verifying still more with this fact the doctrine
                                affirmed.</p>
                            <p>“The soundings that were made had no result, and I would have omitted
                                them if at the time I could have foreseen the existence of the
                                breakers; however, the order and direction in which the plans were
                                drawn were such that the said breakers could not be reached till
                                after the taking of the soundings of the sections marked in the
                                plan. In the little island of Morteritos, nevertheless, the
                                concavity affected by the basin is more marked in the left dike,
                                which proves, refuting anterior arguments, that the deepest channel
                                has always been the left one. If one compares the original plans
                                with the one I forward it will be seen that the change that took
                                place consisted in having produced an accumulation of earth toward
                                the right in such quantity that the central channel that formed two
                                little islands has disappeared, leaving a single island, and in
                                which the waters have broken the western extremity of the islet,
                                leaving a small part to the left, which gives to the channel of the
                                same side a much more direct access.</p>
                            <p>“The ground accumulated toward the right of the convex side and the
                                formation of a new basin on the concave side proves the exactness of
                                the principle established. To determine the actual state, a survey
                                was made in a longitudinal direction, sounding the channel and
                                determining the deepest points; then were taken the transversal
                                sections. As is seen by figures Nos. 5 and 6, relating thereto, the
                                south channel obtains a maximum depth of 2 meters, and the north
                                channel reaches 2 meters and 90 centimeters, without having,
                                besides, any sand bank that prevents or interferes with navigation,
                                being, on the contrary, more uniform in its depth than the one to
                                the right. The statement shows in the clearest manner that the two
                                islets to which I have referred occupy the right border of the
                                deepest channel of the river in its actual state, and that they must
                                have been in equal condition at the time of the drawing of the
                                limits, as both science and experience demonstrate.</p>
                            <p>“This much for the technical part; let us see now what tradition and
                                use can show us in this respect. Before the drawing of the dividing
                                line the two islands were indiscriminately used by the inhabitants
                                of both banks of the river; those of the right made a more frequent
                                use of them because access was easier to them, owing to the fact of
                                its drying up at low water, and being much less deep at high tide,
                                they could cross the channel dry footed in the first case, and
                                seldom deemed it worth while to take a boat in the second. Since the
                                tracing of the limits Mexican citizens exclusively have made use of
                                the two islands. In the island of Sabinita there has been up to date
                                no efforts to attempt to interrupt this custom; in that of
                                Morteritos the residents of the American side have attempted to go
                                over to the islet to take wood. However this has been the object of
                                immediate reclamation, the result being that the abuse has been
                                almost entirely corrected, and only during the night and stealthily
                                have they returned to renew the attempts; on the contrary, in the
                                two islands, there are farms sown by the rancheros of the Mexican
                                side. This custom and quiet possession have never been disputed by
                                any one. All of them had knowledge of my mission they accompanied me
                                in my operations, and were truly astonished that the Government had
                                thought it necessary to examine on whose side was the right to the
                                islets when there has not been the slightest motive for questioning
                                it, at least in the locality itself. There is the peculiarity that
                                both islets are uncultivated and that notwithstanding the fact that
                                no one’s ownership is acknowledged, by prior or tacit agreement the
                                sowing of the one is respected, while the others confine themselves
                                to taking fire-wood or lumber, the trade in which is the principal
                                industry of San Pedro.”</p>
                            <p>It is really satisfactory to be able to quote these facts, which are
                                the most definite corroboration of my deductions, and conclusively
                                clear up the question given to be solved. By order of the President
                                of the Republic I have the honor to transcribe to you the foregoing
                                for your information, and as a result of your dispatch relative

                            <p>As the Government will, acquaint itself by the inclosures that I have
                                the honor to annex, a party of fifty men, coming from the State of
                                Texas, and headed by W. W. Bohrman and O. W. Brewerton, took
                                possession, on the 20th day of January last, of the island of
                                Morteritos, in the Rio Bravo del Norte, an island in the possession
                                of its owners, residents of this city, and appertaining to the
                                territory of Mexico on account of its having remained on the right
                                of the larger arm and deepest channel of the Rio at the fixing of
                                the limits of the two nations by the treaties of 1848 and 1854, that
                                established as the dividing line between the two Republics at the
                                parallel of the 31° 47′ latitude north, the deepest channel of the
                                river where there was more than one channel, as it was at that
                                time.</p>
                            <p>The invaders on taking possession of said island drove away with
                                threats the owners who were found sowing the ground. They cut down
                                and carried off timber, they scattered over the island, destroying
                                the fences and buildings that were there, made by the owners,
                                residents of this city. A recent change made in the channel of the
                                Rio by the swelling of the waters has given occasion for the event,
                                because, owing to this change in the basin, the island of
                                Morteritos, that was, at the date of the treaties of limits on the
                                right of the larger arm and deepest channel of the Rio Grande, has
                                now remained on the left of it.</p>
                            <p>The political authorities here were informed of the event by Don
                                Manual Garza Pena, resident of this place and one of the owners of
                                the island that were driven away from it by those that invaded it. I
                                instituted an inquiry on the situation of said island of Morteritos,
                                the result of which was that by the declarations of Don Francisco
                                Flores Gonzales, commissioned colonel of cavalry, native and
                                resident of this city, seventy-eight years of age; Don Anastasio
                                Barrera, land-holder and resident, sixty-eight years old; Don Juan
                                Sabas Flores, land-owner, native, and resident of this city, seventy
                                years old; Don Pedro Barrera, land-holder, resident of this city,
                                fifty-one years old; Don José Nazario Rodriguez, land-owner, native
                                and resident of this city, sixty years old, and Don José Maria Garza
                                Pena, land-owner, native and resident of this city, fifty-two years
                                old, all personally known to the undersigned, president of this
                                republican council, and all persons that, for their age, capacity,
                                instruction, probity, the independence of their means, and their
                                personal antecedents, have always deserved faith and credence,
                                having no direct or indirect interest in said island of Morteritos;
                                the result, I repeat, of which was that by the declarations of these
                                individuals, “the said island has always belonged to Mexico and been
                                under the jurisdiction of Mier, the heirs of Don Francisco Garcia
                                possessing it by ownership, one of whom is Don Manuel Garza Peña,
                                already referred to; that though there has recently been a change in
                                the deepest channel of the river, before this the largest arm of the
                                same, and its deepest channel have always been on the side of Texas,
                                so much so that the steamer during the war with the United States
                                used to pass through it, and a long time after.”</p>
                            <p>In view of these declarations, and besides because it is notorious
                                that said island has always been recognized by all, both authorities
                                and inhabitants of both banks of the river, as Mexican territory and
                                an integral part of the municipality of Mier in the State of
                                Tamaulipas, to which municipality and State it has always paid the
                                taxes there established, as the owners can prove by their receipts,
                                I ordered the administrator of justice of the demarkation of
                                Guardado, in which the said island is placed, to verify the facts as
                                they were stated by Don Manuel Garza Peña.</p>
                            <p>In view thereof, there being no in Starr County, Texas, whence the
                                invaders came (<hi rend="italic">i. e</hi>, W. W. Bohrman, justice
                                of the peace of the town of Roma, and O. W. Brewerton, <pb n="390"
                                    xml:id="pg_390" facs="0490"/>the surveyor of that county, and
                                residents of the same, who accompanied them), I addressed to the
                                county judge of Starr County the letter of which a copy is given, in
                                reply to which I received a letter from that judge, of which I
                                inclose a copy in order that the Government may he informed of the
                                event, which is of great importance to the integrity of our
                                territory, if left as a precedent uncared for by the authorities,
                                because other events of the same nature will follow, and in view of
                                the accompanying documents, may take suitable measures in the case,
                                addressing the supreme Government, I hasten to inform it of all that
                                is stated in this communication and copies annexed, hoping to
                                receive the determination reached on this subject, observing that
                                the invaders have had recourse to the tribunals of Texas, begging
                                that the land of said island of Morteritos should be declared to
                                have been acquired by right of accession by the owners of the land
                                on the left bank of the Rio Bravo del Norte.</p>

                            <p>Don Manuel Garza Peña presented himself and stated that a crowd of
                                about fifty individuals, residents of and coming from Texas, headed
                                by the judge of the peace of Roma, W. W. Bohrman, and by the
                                surveyor, O. W. Brewerton, on the 20th instant, invaded the Mexican
                                territory and committed acts of spoliation in the island of
                                Morteritos, which is Mexican territory, included in this
                                jurisdiction, and belongs to individuals, residents of this
                                municipality. The complainant adds that they broke the fences, cut
                                down timber, and threatened the servants of the owners that they met
                                there with assault if they remained on the island. As this
                                occurence, if it really took place, is of such gravity that it
                                requires that the authorities proceed with the greatest thoroughness
                                and rapidity to verify and apply a speedy remedy, as soon as you
                                receive this communication, you will proceed to verify the facts and
                                report in writing immediately that which is proper; and I advise you
                                that the complainant states that Messrs. Don Felipe Muñoz, Don
                                Francisco Guerra, Don Anastasio Medina, and Don José Maria Gonzalez
                                were witnesses to the invasion, and Don Cipriano Perez, José Maria
                                Gonzalez, Matias Guzman and Merced Garcia to the destruction of
                                fences and carrying off and cutting down of timber, and that among
                                the individuals those known are Antonio Escobar, Prudencio Escobar,
                                Jesus Saenz, Ramon Escobar, Santos Escobar, Tomas Saens, Juan Saens,

                                Morteritos to make suitable investigations, and proceeded <pb
                                    n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0491"/>in the following way: I
                                summoned the parties who had witnessed the destruction of timber in
                                the island to meet and present themselves before me, and took the
                                depositions of citizens Cipriano Perez, José Maria Gonzalez, Matias
                                Guzman and Merced Garcia. I went afterwards in company with two of
                                the number and the interested party to the island for more
                                information concerning the facts. I met with destruction of timber
                                of all kinds, beside what the individuals were able to carry away,
                                because one can see the havoc which they committed, destroying
                                inclosures and breaking the fence in four places, the first place
                                occupying 4 paces; the second, 11; the third, 3; and the fourth, 5,
                                to which I give testimony. After this I went to Rancho Nuevo in
                                company with one, an interested party, to inquire for Félipe Muñoz,
                                Francisco Guerra, and Anastasio Medina, and found them ready to
                                testify as to the invasion; of all of which I advise you for your
                                guidance and consequent purposes.</p>

                                of said river, was effected in a slow manner during the course, of
                                time, or whether this change was sudden and violent, determining in

                            <p>By a telegram dated yesterday the collector of customs of Mier sends
                                the following message to this department:</p>
                            <p>“I have received information of the existence of contraband dealings
                                in foreign horses and cattle on lands in the island of Morteritos;
                                however, as it is situated in the Rio Bravo, I have consulted the
                                president of council as to whether it was Mexican territory, and he
                                informed me that it had always been considered as belonging to this
                                jurisdiction; that, however, in consequence of the late freshets,
                                the course of the river had been changed, and the nationality of it
                                is now being argued before the American courts, a circumstance which
                                has made me hesitate in coming to a decision, begging you to tell me
                                what I must do. It is also proper for me to inform you that a few
                                days ago American custom-house guards, by order of the collector,
                                seized some Mexican cattle on said land, and insisted on security
                                from the owner pending the decision of the courts. I hope to hear
                                promptly by telegram what you decide.”</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to transcribe this to you, begging you to tell me
                                with all the speed the case requires, whether the island alluded to
                                is part of the national territory, and <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392"
                                    facs="0492"/>whether the Mexican authorities exercise
                                jurisdiction over it, so that in view of this information this
                                department may adopt the necessary measures respecting the fiscal

                            <p>The governor of the State of Tamaulipas informed this department, by
                                a communication of the 23d of February last, that several
                                individuals from Texas, headed by W. W. Bohrman and O. W. Brewerton,
                                invaded the island of Morteritos, in the Rio Bravo, and took
                                possession of it, dislodging from the same the Mexican citizens who
                                possessed it, who were residents of Mier City.</p>
                            <p>From the investigation made by the council of this city of Mier and
                                from the statements and inclosures, copies of which were sent to the
                                governor, it appears that the invasion took place on the 20th of
                                January of this year; that the island, which was inhabited by
                                residents of Mier, has always been considered as an integral part of
                                the territory of Mexico, being on the right of the largest arm and
                                the deepest channel of the Bravo at the fixing of the limits of
                                these two nations by the treaties of 1848 and 1854, which
                                established as the dividing line as far as the parallel of 31° 47′
                                north latitude the deepest channel of the river, where it had more
                                than one channel, as it had at this point, and that by a, recent
                                change made in the channel by the freshets in the Bravo, the island
                                referred to has remained on the left of the largest arm of the
                                deepest channel of the said river.</p>
                            <p>In order to adopt suitable measures, this department asked
                                information from the governor of Tamaulipas, relative to the change
                                in the currents of the Rio Bravo, owing to which the island
                                aforesaid has remained on the left bank of the largest arm of the
                                deepest channel of said river, whether it occurred in a slow manner
                                in the course of time, or whether the change was sudden and violent,
                                determining in a short time the present situation of the said
                                island.</p>
                            <p>I also asked said functionary to join to his report, for the better
                                illustration of the point, a sketch in which could be seen with due
                                precision the present position of the island and the one it held
                                before.</p>
                            <p>The above-mentioned governor has answered by a communication of the
                                7th of the current month, inclosing a letter sent to him by the
                                president of the council of the city of Mier, in which he says it is
                                impossible to comply with the request of this department, for want
                                of an engineer to make the required sketch. In view of the
                                importance of this matter, and for the purpose of adopting suitable
                                measures, I beg you to name an engineer that could go in person to
                                examine the disputed spot, in order to present to this department
                                the information and sketch requested from the governor of
                                Tamaulipas.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your notes of the 13th of March, 24th of
                            May, and 2d and 12th of June of the present year, have presented the
                            question of the disputed ownership of two islands in the Rio Bravo, near
                            Roma, Tex. This question has received the careful consideration due to
                            its importance, and I have now the honor to acquaint you with the reply
                            of this Government to the representations made on behalf of that of
                            Mexico, and especially to the detailed case presented with your note of
                            12th June.</p>
                        <p>The two islands, as you state, are known in Spanish as Morteritos and
                            Sabinitos, and in your note of the 2d of June it is assumed that they
                            are the islands designated as Nos. 12 and 13 at the time of the original
                            survey.</p>
                        <p>This is, however, incorrect of Sabinitos Island, which appears in the
                            maps of the original survey made by the boundary commission in 1853 as
                            No. 14, and is therein credited to Mexico. As the papers submitted by
                            you show no question of importance affecting the island of Sabinitos
                            (No. 14) it may be laid aside for the present.</p>
                        <p>The question seems to be confined to the island known as Morteritos,
                            which appears in the charts of the boundary commission as Beaver Island,
                            No. 13.</p>
                        <p>This island was formerly the most southerly and the larger of two
                            pod-shaped islands lying in a bend of the river near the Texan town of
                            Roma. The channel, never at any time navigable, which formerly separated
                            the two islands is now dry, and the channel to the northward of <pb
                                n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0494"/>the twin island so formed is
                            the widest, and at the present time the deepest of the two arms of the
                            river.</p>
                        <p>The Mexican claim to jurisdiction rests briefly on the following bases: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>A scientific report of the engineer, Garfias, dated 16th
                                    April, 1880, which argues that the present deepest channel to
                                    the northward must always have been the deepest (and therefore
                                    under the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo the boundary line between
                                    the two countries), in pursuance of an observed peculiarity of
                                    rivers by which the deepest flow of water follows the hollow of
                                    a curve in the river bed.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Ownership by Mexican citizens, and an agreement among said
                                    owners, in March, 1874, whereby the island of Morteritos and its
                                    accretions were confirmed to them under the authority of
                                    Mexico.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The second of these points is to be dismissed forthwith from
                            consideration, for this Government does not admit, nor if the case were
                            reversed is it to be supposed that the Mexican Government would admit,
                            the. right of alien owners of land to transfer, under color of any
                            judicial agreement whatsoever, the territorial domain over their estates
                            to the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the nation to whom such
                            individuals owe allegiance. This position is, moreover, wholly opposed
                            to the contention of the Mexican Government itself, that the territorial
                            jurisdictions established on behalf of the respective parties to the
                            treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo remain forever as originally fixed under
                            that compact, and are not to be affected by any abrupt changes in the
                            course of the river Bravo.</p>
                        <p>This reduces the question to one of simple fact, namely, the
                            ascertainment of the boundary channel fixed by the commissioners under
                            the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.</p>
                        <p>To the end of ascertaining that fact, an examination of the original
                            records and charts of the commissioner of survey has been made by Brig.
                            Gen. W. H. Emory, of the United States Army, under whose supervision, as
                            commissioner on the part of the United States, the original survey and
                            determination of the boundary was effected.</p>
                        <p>That officer, under date of the 19th ultimo, reports as follows: <quote

                                <p>* * * By reference to original notes and maps in State
                                    Department, I find Islands Nos. 12 and 14 were assigned to
                                    Mexico, and 14, I believe to be Island Sabinos [Sabinitos]
                                    referred to by Señor Romero.</p>
                                <p>Island No. 13 was assigned to the United States. It is no doubt
                                    the island called by Señor Romero Morteritos, and by me Beaver
                                    Island. I say of that island, in my report, that “the waters of
                                    the Rio Grande are divided at that point into three parts, and
                                    the channel that lies nearest to the Mexican shore is so narrow
                                    that steamers can with difficulty pass through it, yet the
                                    branches, by reason of their shallowness, are wholly impassable
                                    for them. An attempt was made by the Mexican local authorities
                                    to arrest a steamboat in its passage through the narrow channel,
                                    but the actual experience of the navigator proved it to be the
                                    true channel and consequently the boundary between the two
                                    countries.</p>
                                <p>It was further agreed between the commissioners that in case the
                                    channel changed, the right of navigation should remain
                                    unimpaired to both countries, but the jurisdiction of the land
                                    should remain as we had arranged.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>So far as the question of territorial jurisdiction in the event of a
                            change in the channel is concerned, the agreement of the commissioner
                            remains merely an expression of opinion, which, however valuable as an
                            enunciation of a theoretical principle, has not been confirmed as
                            between the two Governments. That of Mexico has, however, on various
                            occasions, put forth this principle as its own, and a proposal has been
                            made through your predecessor, Señor Mariscal, and through you, to
                            negotiate a formal conventional agreement on that basis in settlement of
                            disputes touching the true river boundary under the treaty of Guadalupe
                            Hidalgo. That proposal is now under attentive consideration.</p>
                        <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0495"/>
                        <p>As to the original ownership of the two islands known by the United
                            States commission as Beaver Islands, being the island known to your
                            Government as Morteritos, and the smaller island lying parallel with
                            Morteritos, and to the north of it, there can be no doubt that they were
                            by the survey assigned to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Against the actual record of the commission (the original charts of which
                            you have been afforded an opportunity of inspecting in person in company
                            with General Emory) the speculative and scientific report of Engineer
                            Garfias and his survey and soundings, made seventeen years after the
                            original official determination of the boundary channel, can have no
                            weight whatever, being based on an evidently changed condition of
                            things, whereby the old middle water-course between the two islands has
                            disappeared, and the most northerly of the three channels has been
                            deflected and deepened in the process of time.</p>
                        <p>This Government must deny the implication conveyed in your note of June
                            12, and its accompaniments, that the United States have tacitly
                            acquiesced in the jurisdictional rights from time to time assumed by the
                            Mexican local authorities over the territory covered by the islands in
                            question. No case in point has arisen to call the attention of this
                            Government to the question. The owners of the land were Mexican
                            citizens, as it appears, and their acquiescence in the Mexican claims of
                            jurisdiction over their land, although natural under the circumstances,
                            was wholly devoid of any confirmatory power as against the rights of the
                            United States under the treaty. It was not until very recently, when the
                            action of the Mexican authorities of Mier developed a wholly untenable
                            claim to jurisdiction over a broad tract of low-lying land on the United
                            States bank of the river, which land it was pretended had at some time
                            become united with one of the islands through the filling up of the
                            water-way between them, that a case calling for investigation and action
                            was presented, involving also, as it does, the question of the true
                            ownership of the island claimed to have been enlarged by the accretion
                            of United States territory. The rights of the United States in the
                            premises remained, perhaps, dormant, hut without laches on their part,
                            and, on the issue being revived, those rights revive, too, in all their
                            force.</p>
                        <p>Touching the reference in your note to the statement found on page 65 of
                            the Report of the Boundary Survey, that “Islands Nos. 12 and 13, between
                            Ringgold Barracks and Roma, both fall to the United States,” it should
                            be here stated that the report is erroneous, through a typographical
                            mistake. The original charts and notes show that Island No. 12 is a
                            small island, named “Green Key Island” on the charts, situated in an
                            abrupt bend of the river, about half way between Fort Ringgold and
                            Morteritos Island. Island No. 13, as already shown, comprises the twin
                            Beaver Islands, whereof the larger and more southerly was called by the
                            Mexicans Morteritos. The Island known to both parties as Sabinitos (or
                            Sabinos) is marked No. 14 on the chart, and lies a short distance above
                            Roma.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I have the honor to inform you, in answer to your several
                            notes, that the facts and record of the case warrant and demand that the
                            Government of the United States shall regard its territorial
                            jurisdiction over the island of Morteritos, otherwise Beaver Island (No.
                            13), as established by the boundary commission under the treaty of
                            Guadalupe Hidalgo, and, consequently, that the Mexican pretension to
                            that island and to accretions thereto from the left or United States
                            bank of the Rio Grande shall be denied.</p>

                            of the 10th July last, in reply to those which I addressed to the
                            Department on the 13th of March and the 24th of the preceding May, and
                            the 2d and 12th of June, with respect to the question raised touching
                            the ownership of the islands of Morteritos and Sabinitos, situated in
                            the Rio Bravo.</p>
                        <p>You were pleased to state in the aforesaid note that the island of
                            Sabinitos appeared marked as No. 14 in the maps of the original survey
                            made by the boundary commission in 1853, and that it remained on the
                            Mexican side, for which reason there can be no doubt thereto, and with
                            respect to the island of Morteritos or Beaver Island or Island No. 13,
                            you state: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>To the end that the Mexican Government might better examine the bases
                            presented by yon in order to reach the conclusions which you expressed,
                            I solicited, together with General Emory, permission to examine the
                            original maps of the mixed boundary commission which exist in the
                            Department of State, since I could not here consult the copies existing
                            in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>There appeared to be an evident confusion in the name of Island No. 13,
                            and it did not clearly appear whether it was or was not the island of
                            Morteritos.</p>
                        <p>A careful examination on this subject having been made by my Government,
                            the President has decided not to insist upon the rights of Mexico over
                            the island of Morteritos in the supposition that it is Island No. 13, or
                            Beaver Island.</p>
                        <p>The bases of this decision rest upon the stipulations of the fifth
                            article of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of February 2, 1848, that the
                            dividing line between our two countries from the Gulf of Mexico to Paso
                            del Norte should be the center of the Rio Grande, and that where this
                            river had more than one channel the line should follow the deepest. This
                            circumstance being borne in mind by the boundary commission in laying
                            down the line, the channel which lay to the south of Island No. 13, or
                            Morteritos, or Beaver Island, left this island upon the side of the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>As this is the basis presented by the Government of the United States to
                            defend its rights to that island, it thus recognizes that the limit
                            between the two Republics are those fixed by the treaty of Guadalupe
                            Hidalgo, such as were laid down by the mixed commission, without having
                            been altered by the changes occasioned by the current of the river,
                            whether in its margins or the deepest of its channels.</p>
                        <p>It is very satisfactory to me to see that in this important point there
                            is an uniformity of views and principles between our two
                            Governments.</p>

                        <p>I cannot end this note without calling your attention to the good faith
                            and justice of the Government of Mexico in the present case, since
                            instead of leaving this matter pending, or proposing that it should be
                            decided by the treaty which it has submitted for the consideration of
                            the United States, it has acted with loyalty in recognizing their rights
                            without reserve.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of the 21st ultimo, in which you take exception to
                            an expression in my note of the 16th of October last, and say that the
                            Government of Mexico has not relinquished jurisdiction over “certain
                            islands” in the Rio Grande, but over “Morteritos” simply.</p>
                        <p>The original claim of Mexico, as you well know, was to the possession of
                            Morteritos and Sabinitos islands, so-called, numbered respectively 12
                            and 13, in the Rio Grande. An examination of the charts showed that
                            these two names never had any existence in fact, but that they had been
                            improperly applied to Beaver Islands, twin islands in that river, which
                            had been awarded to the United States by the commission of 1848. The
                            expression “certain islands” had reference to the original claim. The
                            examination, it is true, further establishes that an island, Sabinos,
                            belonged to Mexico, but this was neither numbered 12 nor 13 on the
                            charts, and from its location it seems improbable that it should have
                            been confounded with Sabinitos. Sabinos was, consequently, never in
                            dispute.</p>
                        <p>I need not assure you that the United States has no wish to claim
                            anything beyond that which properly belongs to it, and that the phrase
                            “certain islands,” while used in the sense I have explained, may be
                            understood as without prejudice to any possible rights attaching to
                            Mexico. If such cases exist, the recently signed treaty of November 12,
                            1884, for a more definite determination of our common boundary line,
                            will, when completed by ratification, exchange, and proclamation, afford
                            bases for a final adjustment of the question involved.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have had the honor to receive
                            your esteemed note, dated yesterday, in answer to the one I sent you by
                            direction of the ministry of foreign relations of Mexico on the 21st of
                            November ultimo, for the purpose of calling the attention of your
                            Department to the meaning of an expression contained in the
                            communication sent by you to Señor Romero on the 16th of October last,
                            in respect to the renunciation of certain islands in the Rio Grande on
                            the part of Mexico.</p>
                        <p>You are pleased to show me that said expression refers to the original
                            claim made by Mexico in the case, and that meant the islands of
                            Morteritos and Sabinitos, in the belief that these were those marked in
                            the plans of the boundary commission of 1853 with the Nos. 12 and 13;
                                <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0499"/>however, that the
                            examination of said plans show that these numbers did not in reality
                            exist; that they were improperly given, and that reference was made to
                            the Castor Islands (Beaver Islands), twin islands that were assigned to
                            the United States by the commission of 1848; that since then it was
                            discovered that the island of Sabinos belonged to Mexico; that, however,
                            the latter was neither No. 12 nor 13 that appear in the said plans, and
                            it was not probable that it could have been mistaken on account of its
                            position for that of Sabinitos.</p>
                        <p>You add that you believe it unnecessary to assure me that the United
                            States have no desire to claim anything but what belongs to them
                            properly, and that the expression, the sense of which you are pleased to
                            explain, must be understood as in no way injuring the rights that Mexico
                            may have in the case; that besides, if such rights exist, the treaty
                            signed on the 12th of November, 1884, for a better demarkation of the
                            dividing line between the two countries will regulate, as soon as it is
                            ratified, exchanged, and promulgated, the bases for the final settlement
                            of similar questions.</p>
                        <p>On acknowledging your answer, which I have the honor to do, I shall
                            transmit your said note to the ministry of foreign relations of Mexico
                            for its knowledge. I must assure you that I am certain that the
                            Government of Mexico has not the slightest idea of wounding in any
                            manner the susceptibility of the Government of the United States in this
                            affair, and that its only purpose was to make it appear that the
                            resolution taken in the case, founded on the acknowledgment that it had
                            no right on the island of Morteritos, referred to this one alone; also
                            that the Castor one (Beaver, as the United. States calls it) is formed
                            of two little islands which have always been considered as one, and is,
                            besides, the only one in dispute.</p>
                        <p>As regards the island of Sabinitos, in speaking of it this legation has
                            always had reference to Sabinos, which appears on said plans marked with
                            number 14 and belonging to Mexico, and your Department as well as
                            General Emory have given it indiscriminately the one or the other
                            name.</p>

                        was called officially to a repetition of the outrages at Hamadan in
                        November. * * * Anxious to obtain official evidence as to the cases, and
                        also to satisfy myself that our citizens at Hamadan had conducted themselves
                        with discretion, I felt it my duty to dispatch our dragoman, Mr. Keün, to
                        Hamadan. He went on the 18th January, and returned on the 12th instant. * *
                        * His conduct at Hamadan was vigorous and effective, and <pb n="400"

                        obtained, forms along narrative, which is not yet complete. As soon as

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that on the 12th of
                        June I was riding out to the country from Teheran in a carriage, on the way
                        to the summer quarters of the legation. I was accompanied by my daughter.
                        According to the custom of the country, the carriage was preceded by two
                        outriders. The other legations on such an occasion take four to eight
                        outriders, a matter of necessity as well as of display in Persia. As we
                        approached a half-way coffee-house I observed a line of carriages waiting by
                        the roadside in the shade. As it is very common for several vehicles to be
                        seen standing there, while the occupants are taking a smoke, I had no idea
                        that any precaution needed to be taken. I was greatly surprised, therefore,
                        to see a troop of mounted cavalry rush out from the shade of the trees and
                        make a violent attack on my outriders, who immediately cried out several
                        times that the United States minister was in the carriage, and had the right
                        of way. I now recognized the soldiers to belong to the royal guard, and
                        immediately after perceived that the wives of the Shah were in the
                        carriages. Although having officially the absolute right to pass, allowed to
                        none except ministers and their families, at risk of immediate death to all
                        others, I ordered my driver to stop, in order to give an officer opportunity
                        to come to the carriage to apologize for the attack and escort us safely
                        through the <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0501"/>guards stationed in
                        front and rear of the royal harem. But as no attention seemed to be paid to
                        this, I ordered my men to keep on, thus throwing the responsibility of any
                        results on the guards, who, not satisfied with beating the outriders with
                        the flat of their swords, swarmed around the carriage itself with loud cries
                        and flourishing their weapons. The lieutenant of the troop seized the
                        carriage horses, others struck and thrust at the horses, and two even struck
                        the driver himself. Fortunately the man was alike skillful and intrepid, and
                        succeeded both in controlling the horses and driving us safely out of a
                        disagreeable <hi rend="italic">melée</hi> that at one moment threatened
                        serious results. The number of men attacking was about twenty. It is proper
                        to add that when the chief lady of the harem saw what was going on she
                        dispatched a eunuch to escort us through the lines, but he did not arrive
                        until the attack was nearly ended. All my men and horses were more or less
                        bruised, and one of the men had his arm nearly broken. They all behaved
                        well. * * *</p>
                    <p>On the same evening I sent a note to the minister of foreign affairs,
                        demanding the prompt chastisement of the offenders, leaving it to the
                        Persian Government to suggest out of its friendship such further redress as
                        the occasion required.</p>
                    <p>There being some delay in replying to my note, I sent our dragoman, Mr. Keün,
                        to the minister of foreign affairs. After quite an extended interview, the
                        minister replied, “Tell your minister he shall hear from me to-morrow. I am
                        anxious that he should be convinced of our good will, and I give you my word
                        you shall be entirely satisfied by sunset to-morrow that I am sincere in
                        these expressions.”</p>
                    <p>At 11 a. m. the following day, accordingly, the sanieh-ed-dowleh, a prominent
                        member of the cabinet, was announced. Coming at once to the point, he stated
                        that he had been personally deputed by the Shah to express the royal regret,
                        and to say authoritatively that our demands should receive immediate
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>In the afternoon of the same day I received an apologetic note from the
                        minister of foreign affairs. In accordance with a request at the end of the
                        note, our moonchee went to the foreign office next morning, and was there
                        directed to take my driver and outriders and proceed at once to
                        Sultanalabâd, the summer place where the Shah is staying at present. On
                        arriving there the moonchee was confronted with the royal guards, and the
                        men who had been most forward in the attack on my carriage, including their
                        lieutenant, were recognized by my men. A grand chamberlain of the palace
                        then ordered the punishment of the men, and they were accordingly punished.
                        I think we could not ask further proof of the friendliness of the Shah
                        toward the United States than the important fact that he ordered a number of
                        the royal guards to be punished at the instance of a foreign legation.</p>
                    <p>In the afternoon of the same day the captain of the company came to the
                        legation and apologized in a graceful and thoroughly satisfactory manner for
                        the hasty and unwarranted action of the guards.</p>
                    <p>Two days later I called on the minister of foreign affairs and thanked him
                        for the satisfactory manner in which the affair had terminated, and, later,
                        I acknowledged his note in a note intended to reach the eye of the Shah,
                        who, I have reason to know, as soon as he fully appreciated the gravity of
                        the occasion, was willing, if possible, to anticipate our demands.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: * * * In 1875–’76 the United States citizens
                        [at Hamadan] were solicited by the Armenian community to aid them in their
                        sufferings caused by the famine. The missionaries accordingly advanced 250
                        tomans, equal to some $410. As guarantee for the money, the missionaries
                        received possession of an old Armenian church. The papers stipulated that
                        the church should be practically the property of the missionaries, who
                        needed a church but encountered difficulties in building a special
                        structure. It was further stipulated that if any of the community, including
                        the signers of the papers for the Armenians, at any time raised objections
                        to this arrangement they should pay back the loan with compound interest at
                        10 per cent. before regaining possession of the church.</p>
                    <p>In November of 1883, however, the Armenians seized the church without either
                        giving previous notice or offering to pay the money, carrying off also the
                        chairs placed in it by the missionaries. Soon after this the two school
                        buildings rented by the United States citizens were violently seized by the
                        authorities, the locks forced off the doors, and the doors fastened with an
                        official seal.</p>
                    <p>On receiving formal notice of these outrages I decided to send Mr. Keün, our
                        dragoman, to Hamadan. Mr. Keün prevailed upon the authorities to punish some
                        of the offenders against the personal security of our citizens, and caused
                        the schools to be reopened. He also obtained the names of the chief
                        offenders in the seizure of the church and important testimony towards the
                        repayment of the money.</p>
                    <p>But some weeks after Mr. Keün’s return, the authorities again forcibly closed
                        and sealed the doors of the schools.</p>
                    <p>I then brought the matter to the attention of the present minister of foreign
                        affairs. I represented to him that by the terms of our treaty the United
                        States have the rights of the most favored nations; that according to the
                        treaty of Turkomantchai no city or authority in Persia has a right to
                        prejudge the United States citizens or take the law into their own hands in
                        case of complaint, real or imaginary; and that not the slightest excuse now
                        existed for doing so since the establishment of a United States legation in
                        Persia, to which complaints could be brought in regular form, and through
                        its mediation cases settled according to the modes prescribed by the treaty.
                        I showed his excellency that not only had the authorities at Hamadan
                        entirely ignored our treaty rights in prejudging and punishing our citizens
                        without bringing their complaints to the foreign office and this legation,
                        but they had also been guilty of a very grave offense in seizing and holding
                        American property contrary to the treaty of Turkomantchai.</p>
                    <p>The nasr-ul-mulk, after considerable discussion, frankly acknowledged the
                        force of the argument and signified that he would exert himself to give us
                        redress and teach the people and authorities of Hamadan to respect our
                        treaty rights. He was as good as his word, and immediately sent very
                        stringent orders to Hamadan to cease further meddling with our citizens, to
                        restore the property, and in future report all complaints <pb n="403"
                            xml:id="pg_403" facs="0503"/>to Teheran instead of judging our citizens
                        without the presence of a delegate from this legation.</p>
                    <p>After further negotiations, the Shah, being weary of the annoyances at
                        Hamadan and the evident purpose of the authorities to obstruct his wishes
                        towards a harmonious adjustment of the business, finally declared himself in
                        a manner so emphatic that all opposition was, at least for the time,
                        effectually checked. The minister of foreign affairs was ordered to send a
                        commissioner to Hamadan without further delay, to obtain the redress we
                        demanded and to enjoin the local authorities to have a care how they
                        ventured again to disobey the directions and wishes of the foreign office or
                        annoyed the United States citizens. Before leaving, the commissioner was
                        sent to this legation to explain to me his instructions, and asked for a
                        letter of introduction from me to our citizens. The results of the
                        commissioner’s efforts at Hamadan justified our expectations that the
                        Government of Persia is sincere in its expressions of friendship and its
                        intention to afford all the protection in its power to peaceable citizens
                        residing in its territory.</p>
                    <p>Administering a very severe reprimand to the authorities, the commissioner
                        presented his orders, and commanded the school buildings from which our
                        citizens had been ejected to be opened and returned without delay. After
                        this he called the offending Armenians before him, who had seized the
                        church, and made them understand that they could no longer expect to be
                        protected from the results of their lawless proceedings, but that they must
                        pay the 250 tomans cash down or proceed at their own expense to Teheran for
                        trial. Our citizens having waived their demand for the interest, wisely as I
                        think, under the circumstances, the principal was paid, after much demur.
                        Our citizens gave a quit-claim receipt, acknowledging themselves satisfied.
                        On learning of this, I sent a telegram to the Department, considering the
                        results as indicating the satisfactory character of our relations with the
                        Persian Government at present.</p>
                    <p>I think it reasonable to consider that a valuable precedent has finally been
                        established here in our favor, tending to increase our influence and make it
                        easier to secure our treaty rights in the future.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Little change has occurred since my last
                        report upon the situation.</p>
                    <p>It appears to be settled that Caceres is determined to maintain his position
                        and pretensions, in consequence of which Iglesias’ officials cannot assume
                        authority beyond those places accessible to, and under threat of visitation
                        by, Chilian troops, an occurrence not at all relished by Peruvian
                        communities.</p>
                    <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0504"/>
                    <p>The rainy season upon the eastern side of the Cordillera gives Caceres
                        security from serious attack by the enemy, while apart from them he would be
                        more than a match anywhere for Iglesias’ troops.</p>
                    <p>On the 13th instant elections for deputies are to begin and may extend at
                        each of the polls over a period of twelve days. So far the civil party
                        proper seems disposed not to take part, but it is understood General
                        Iglesias is urging some of the leaders to become Government candidates, and
                        all well-wishers of the country may hope he will be successful. Such men are
                        needed in the Government, and the adhesion of very few would have a wide
                        influence.</p>
                    <p>Chilian forces continue to occupy the vicinity of Lima, Arequipa, Puno, and
                        the line of the Aroya (Transandino) Railway to the frontier of Junian, and
                        while, by declaration, at peace with the established Government of Peru,
                        exercise most of the powers of actual warfare and are waging war with
                        Caceres on the other side of the mountains. The Government of Iglesias is a
                            <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> one over the larger part of the country,
                        is seemingly accepted by a respectable proportion of the people, and yet
                        behind it and over it is always seen the shadow of the protecting arms of
                        Chili. The position is peculiar and full of embarrassing questions.</p>
                    <p>Caceres is reported to have exercised remarkable influence over the most
                        savage of the Indian tribes and to have put an end to their disorders within
                        the extent of country under his control. Iglesias has still to contend with
                        Puga and other like petty chiefs in the north. Reports of their complete
                        overthrow are constantly made and as frequently they reappear upon the
                        scene.</p>
                    <p>I am told it is the purpose of General Iglesias to have twelve thousand
                        troops under arms by the 1st March, the date fixed for the meeting of the
                        assembly, probably for the purpose of maintaining himself if elected
                        president <hi rend="italic">pro tempore</hi>. But I would do him the justice
                        to say that he will submit himself entirely to the assembly. His officials
                        and followers will send most of the delegates, and elections will not be the
                        subject of minute inquiries.</p>
                    <p>How the Government is supported is to me quite a mystery, but many of its
                        expenses remain unpaid.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Having occasion for an interview with Mr.
                        Larrabure, minister of foreign relations of General Iglesias’ Government,
                        concerning certain decrees affecting the railway interests of certain
                        Americans, resident and non-resident, the minister seized the occasion to
                        speak about the recognition of the Government by the United States. He said
                        it appeared to him perfectly clear that it is the Government <hi
                            rend="italic">de facto</hi> of Peru, being supreme over a large part of
                        the territory; that a dispatch from the British Government indicated
                        satisfaction with the existing condition of the Government of General
                        Iglesias, and that it would be recognized on the assembling of the national
                        assembly; that he thought it strange that the United States should, being an
                        elder brother in the family of republics, <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405"
                            facs="0505"/>abstain from recognition until the example had been set by
                        England and European nations. I said to him, your remarks call for a very
                        frank reply; that the President, in his message to our Congress, had denned
                        the conditions on which his recognition would depend, and that, as yet, it
                        did not appear that the people of Peru had very generally recognized Mr.
                        Iglesias; that it had been hoped that the people of Cuzco, and of other
                        central and southern provinces and departments, would spontaneously proclaim
                        this Government; that Cuzco, after two months, had finally received a
                        prefect, as there was reason to believe, only because of fear of visitation
                        by the Chilian troops camped about Arequipa and Puno; that Ayacucho,
                        Huancavelica, Apurimac, and other departments and provinces had not yet
                        submitted to General Iglesias; that Chilian forces perfectly dominated Puno,
                        Arequipa, Moquegua, Lima and Callao, and Junin, being encamped near at hand,
                        and in the latter were actually engaged in hostilities; that Caxamarca in
                        the north, General Iglesias’ home, is actually in possession of Puga, who,
                        although reported as routed, it was now known had defeated the Government
                        forces under command of General Iglesias’ brother, sent against him; that
                        Caceres, whose strength as against the Government is great, had refused to
                        submit, and, in short, that the feeling generally existed amongst Peruvians
                        that General Iglesias is maintained by the presence of the Chilian soldiery
                        about the great center of the country. That I had great desire to view the
                        matter otherwise must be apparent to him, because, apart from the
                        disagreeable feature of incomplete official relations, I appreciated the
                        courage and patriotism that had been so conspicuous in the course which the
                        general had adopted in treating for peace, and which captured alike our
                        sympathies and respect.</p>
                    <p>I shall seek an occasion for a more full conversation with him, and may think
                        it advisable to report by telegraph.</p>
                    <p>There is little doubt that recognition would give prestige to the Government
                        in the view of its own people and remove some, if not many, of its
                        difficulties. In common with the opinion of most Peruvians and of all
                        resident foreigners, I cannot consider the power of General Iglesias
                        sufficient to sustain him after the departure of the Chilian army.</p>
                    <p>An editorial, cut from the Commercio of this morning, the most able paper in
                        Peru, touches upon some of the points referred to in the communication, and
                        I inclosed it without translation, being unable to make one in time for this
                        steamer. You will observe that it opens with reference to the incomplete
                        character of the late elections, because of the opposing chiefs in the
                        northern and central provinces, and is adverse to the proposition to await
                        the assembling of the Congress until those chiefs could be put down. It
                        presents a picture of the condition of Peru very disheartening. The idea has
                        at times pressed upon me that it might be a judicious and humane action on
                        the part of the United States to lend the support of their recognition to
                        General Iglesias, but I am confronted now with statements that not one-fifth
                        of the population has taken part in the election of deputies to the
                        Congress, and that there cannot be said to have been a contest, except in a
                        limited sense, between the Pierolistes and the Government candidates. A few
                        of the civilistes have taken part, and here the names of some have been used
                        as candidates against their published remonstrance. Little interest has been
                        evinced in Lima, and the proportion of men voting is variously estimated at
                        one-fourth to one-seventh of the voting population. The attitude of the
                        people is in some sense one of protest against the Government as well as the
                        peace, while all alike are intensely anxious for peace.</p>

                        published copy of General Caceres’ letter to General Iglesias, in reply to
                        one of his, a copy of which I sent you, appealing to Caceres to submit to
                        this Government.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>The country had erected Caceres into a sort of hero, being the only one about
                        whom the nation could throw any of the halo of military glory or of
                        patriotic persistence in the defense of the country. Had he come here at any
                        time in the past few months, he would have been received with a grand
                        ovation. In the absence of the Chilian troops, he could have come triumphant
                        to Lima without firing a shot.</p>
                    <p>This letter shapes out no line of policy, enters into no details of resources
                        and means of resistance, offers nothing around which the country might rally
                        in the hope of forcing better terms from an unrelenting foe.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Señor General</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge
                            receipt of your esteemed favor of the present month, the contents of
                            which had been made known to me through publications of the Lima
                            press.</p>
                        <p>In replying to it I shall endeavor to avoid, as far as possible, the
                            hateful field of recrimination to which usually tend endeavors to
                            harmonize ideas and sentiments touching the grand international contest
                            in which the Republic is engaged. Thus, perhaps, I may not altogether
                            avoid certain expressions which, from poverty of language, will awaken
                            and wound susceptibilities.</p>
                        <p>I perfectly understand that peace is the first necessity of the people,
                            but this once broken I also comprehend that a state of war does not
                            justify every means to re-establish peace.</p>
                        <p>Although you flatter yourself with having realized your noble purpose of
                            pacifying the country to the satisfaction of the national patriotism, I
                            either deceive myself or fear that the treaty of peace made with Chili,
                            the conditions of which are yet unknown to me, may be, in the disguise
                            of a decorous arrangement, the text of an ominous law imposed by an
                            implacable and haughty victor upon the vanquished, who, on bended knee,
                            implored his clemency.</p>
                        <p>Amongst the reasons prompting disconsolate views is the conviction that
                            Chili, blinded by sordid avarice for territorial aggrandizement, far
                            from modifying her onerous demands, will sustain them unaltered, if not
                            augmented, flattered by the grand spectacle offered her of a government
                            owing its establishment exclusively to the ignominious work of her
                            bayonets, and which does not dispose to forgetfulness of its ignoble
                            origin, destroying the obligations, and purposes you gained by dint of
                            perseverance and self-denial.</p>
                        <p>Such is the sad way in which the force of logic compels us to view the
                            course of events.</p>
                        <p>But, be this as it may, in order to give a categorical answer to the call
                            which you have seen tit to extend to me in your letter, it is necessary
                            to make me acquainted with the conditions of the treaty made with Chili.
                            Should these conform to what self-respect and the well-understood
                            interests of the Republic require, believe me, general, I shall hasten
                            to offer, in good faith, the modest contingent of my services <pb
                                n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0507"/>and to share with you the
                            arduous and glorious task of saving the country, for I shall then secure
                            the satisfaction of my most vehement desires and I shall have attained
                            the object which I have incessantly pursued in four years of bloody
                            contest; but, on the other hand, nothing can make me renounce the
                            convictions and well-settled purposes with which I have been inspired by
                            the line of conduct followed step by step, and with no ambitious
                            personal views, in the long course of the war, without taking into
                            account the dangers and difficulties of the contest, for there is no
                            sacrifice that I am not ready to make for the service of my country, it
                            being better to perish in the endeavor rather than to see one’s self
                            humiliated under the yoke of an ignominious peace.</p>
                        <p>In this thorny path I am accompanied with an unyielding faith and
                            perseverance by the self-denying people under my jurisdiction, who are
                            full of the convictions I here express, since, should fate be adverse,
                            defrauding our efforts of the hoped for success, we shall at least not
                            appear, in the eyes of posterity, unworthy of the cause we profess and
                            defend. Meanwhile, I shall endeavor to keep alive the torch of faith and
                            patriotic enthusiasm, preserving by this means unalterable in the bosoms
                            of the brave people who sustain the beautiful banner of resistance,
                            under whose shadow alone can now take shelter those social guarantees
                            which would soon be overthrown by the whirlwind of popular sentiment,
                            violently opposed in what it holds most sacred, the love of country.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It has become an unpleasant duty to report
                        acts committed, or proposed to be done, by the Iglesias Government,
                        affecting interests of Americans, of a grave and unusual character, and for
                        the better understanding of the possible reach of these earlier measures of
                        the Government, it is necessary to enter into considerable detail.</p>
                    <p>It will be known to you that the late Henry Meiggs entered into a series of
                        contracts with the Government of Peru for railway construction upon a
                        gigantic scale, his contracts in hand at one time aggregating $132,000,000,
                        with the result that Americans became largely interested in the railways of
                        the country. The Peruvian Government was unable to meet its contracts,
                        resulting in a number of the chief railways of the country coming into the
                        management of Americans, engineers and others, under contract for the
                        administration and completion of the lines, the roads generally to revert to
                        the exclusive use and benefit of Peru, upon fulfillment by it of specified
                        conditions. The two most important roads of the country are so managed,
                        while others, in the north and elsewhere, are in the control of Americans
                        under contracts with the Government direct, or with the original
                        contractors. The present difficulties have arisen in instances involving
                        both classes of contracts.</p>
                    <p>General Iglesias arrived here with but little money, and has been since in
                        receipt of small revenues, while the credit of his Government has not been
                        sufficient to secure loans. His officials have been unable to pay
                        transportation bills, and no payments have been made except by sea, so that
                        railway proprietors have been carrying without compensation and with no very
                        flattering prospects for future payment. The exactions, requirements, and
                        requisitions for services have not appeared less urgent or less in amount
                        because of the inability to pay.</p>
                    <p>The first of the present difficulties to which I refer relates to an American
                        company operating the transandine railway, from Callao and <pb n="408"
                            xml:id="pg_408" facs="0508"/>Lima, over the mountains to the Oroya River
                        and to the mines of Cerro del Pasco. The contract with the Government invol
                        ves the completion of the road from Chicla, near the mountain summit, to the
                        Oroya, the road to Cerro del Pasco, and the mining tunnel to drain the
                        mines, of which fabulous accounts have come down to us from the past. The
                        company is known as the “Compania de la Oroya y Minerales de Pasco.” The
                        original company contracted to construct the roads, &amp;c., and
                        provisionally to manage them. It was to have extensive mining rights, and
                        was an association of foreigners organized under Peruvian laws. Its contract
                        with the Government was modified in the year 1880, with power to transfer
                        all its rights to any person or persons, company or companies, foreign or
                        Peruvian, in order to facilitate procuring capital to complete the work, the
                        main road, as before stated, being completed only to Chicla, at an altitude
                        of over 12,000 feet. This right was exercised and the transfer made to an
                        American organization, the new company retaining the old name.</p>
                    <p>When the dictator, Pierola, was making his strenuous efforts for the defense
                        of Lima, and Callao was blockaded by the Chilians, the dependence of Lima
                        for a time was upon the little port of Ancon, connected with the capital by
                        the Chancay Railroad. The road was without the necessary rolling-stock, and
                        was in bad condition for this unusual requirement. In consequence, Pierola
                        issued a decree directing the Oroya Railroad Company, of which William H.
                        Cilley was then, and is now, the managing director, to manage the Chancay
                        road, and to supply such engines, cars, materials, &amp;c., as might be
                        necessary, for which compensation was to be made, and a considerable sum of
                        money was paid to Mr. Cilley for repair of the road, many thousands of men
                        being put upon the work. Ancon, in time, was blockaded, and the road to the
                        north of that place buried and made useless by shells fired from the
                        blockading vessels. It so remains to the present time.</p>
                    <p>The Chilian occupation of Lima followed not long after, and the road was
                        under the military control of the enemy until the arrival here of Iglesias.
                        The Chilians contemplated carrying the railway iron and rolling-stock to
                        Chili, as was done in other instances, but surveys did not result in reports
                        favorable to the project as a paying enterprise. The road has not paid
                        expenses, and has fallen into still worse repair than when taken in hand by
                        Mr. Cilley. A system of annoyances and exactions was inaugurated at an early
                        day in the office of the minister of Government respecting both the Oroya
                        and Chancay roads, but especially the latter, Mr. Cilley in consequence
                        requesting the Government to put some other person in charge of the road, as
                        he wished to be relieved of it and of its responsibilities. Correspondence
                        and decrees followed and an attempt was made to put an official on the Oroya
                        road at the cost of the company and in violation of its contract.</p>
                    <p>These matters were more or less known to me as they occurred, in part through
                        publication of the correspondence, and culminated in the issuance of various
                        decrees, the last in order directing Mr. Cilley to deliver to Mr. Wakulski,
                        appointed administrator of the road, railway materials, cars, engines,
                        &amp;c., property of the Oroya company, or personel by purchase or lease, to
                        make repairs to engines within specified time at the workshops of the Oroya
                        company, all under penalties, and it orders that employés, several being
                        Americans, should continue service in their respective positions until
                        relieved. Proceeding at once to the foreign office I told Mr. Larrabure I
                        desired to see General Iglesias himself concerning the decrees, to whom I
                        said that no government on earth among civilized nations would attempt to
                        seize property in that manner, <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0509"/>and
                        that I felt sure he had not intended to authorize anything of the kind; that
                        if the Government needed the property there were proper ways to secure it by
                        purchase, contract, hire, or otherwise.</p>
                    <p>After examining the decree the general declared it did not call for delivery
                        of property not belonging to the Chancay Railroad and receipted for by Mr.
                        Cilley on inventories. I replied, “Then I am distinctly to understand, and
                        can so inform Mr. Cilley, that the Government will not call upon him under
                        that decree to deliver property belonging to him either by lease or
                        purchase, and not pertaining to the Chancay road?” He replied, “Certainly
                        you are;” adding, “I might as well direct Mr. Cilley to deliver the coat off
                        his back as to deliver cars and material not belonging to the
                        Government.”</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding, a few days later, notice was addressed to Mr. Cilley, by the
                        prefect of Lima, that he should proceed to seize a certain number of engines
                        and material, not property of the Government. Immediately I went, to see Mr.
                        Larrabure, and, not finding him, wrote an informal note, and inclosed copies
                        of the prefect’s notice. Mr. Larrabure subsequently informed me the order to
                        the prefect had been modified. With this assurance I rested content until
                        some days later, when, upon receipt of a note from Mr. Larrabure, I went to
                        the foreign office. Mr. Zaldivar, minister of the Government, was called in.
                        A conversation began as to details of the road management, &amp;c., but I
                        told Mr. Zaldivar “such details did not concern me; that it was the seizure
                        of property I felt anxious about, and that I was greatly interested in
                        settling the matter in some satisfactory manner, securing the Government the
                        service it desired to Ancon and saving it from greater difficulties that I
                        saw must arise from persistence in the orders in question while protecting
                        Mr. Cilley’s rights.”</p>
                    <p>That gentleman was called in, and, I saw, completely won Mr. Larrabure’s
                        confidence, but Mr. Zaldivar insisted that “a decree once issued was
                        irrevocable. A Government could never recall or annull, and that while he
                        asked Mr. Cilley to deliver the next morning two locomotives for service on
                        the Chancay road, he should send soldiers to seize them if not peaceably
                        delivered.” In other words, there was no question of contracting for,
                        hiring, or even borrowing, but a demand to deliver at discretion. The
                        minister remarked that “the Government had a right to appropriate private
                        property to its necessities.” I replied, “The necessity must first exist,
                        and then the condemnation and payment be made in accordance with law.” In
                        this instance the road is usable to Ancon, a place to which some families of
                        Lima resort at this season for bathing, Mr. Zaldivar’s family being one. The
                        railway otherwise is now of little importance and no public interest would
                        suffer through its discontinuance.</p>
                    <p>The following day I saw Mr. Larrabure, and told him “I had hoped to be able
                        to bring about an amicable adjustment, perhaps by some new contract have the
                        road put into effective and satisfactory operation, thus removing one of the
                        difficulties seemingly so needlessly thrust upon the Government, but that I
                        was informed a force had been ordered at 2 p.m. to proceed to seize the
                        engines and to collect fines for non-obeyance of decrees, and I felt such a
                        course to be so arbitrary and inexcusable that I should feel it necessary to
                        cable you should the Government persist; that he might be assured it was a
                        very unpleasant matter for me; that he had observed that I limited myself to
                        objecting to the seizure of American property without process of law; that
                        there were courts of law to which I thought questions of administration or
                        of accounts should <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0510"/>be submitted.”
                        They proposed to seize the safe of the Oroya Company in payment of a fine of
                        500 silver soles imposed by decree of Zaldivar.</p>
                    <p>As before remarked these events have been known to me during their
                        occurrence, and while I have been careful to keep aloof in the hope of a
                        settlement, and because I think diplomatic intervention should be resorted
                        to only as an extremity in the difficulties our countrymen encounter in
                        their self-imposed business pursuits in these countries, I have been aware
                        of Mr. Cilley’s good faith and of his original good-will to the Government
                        of General Iglesias, and I have viewed the official proceedings as in entire
                        disregard of individual rights as well as of common sense in public
                        procedure. I feel sure it did not receive Mr. Larrabure’s approval. At all
                        events the order to the prefect was recalled and an arrangement made with
                        Mr. Cilley so far as regards the two locomotives. The fine was rescinded and
                        criminal proceedings instituted against him recalled. * * * The other
                        instance is that of a railway and pier at Salaverry and Trujillo.</p>
                    <p>When General Iglesias first claimed to exercise power by virtue of the local
                        assembly of Caxamarca, a delegate, in the person of a membe of his family,
                        was sent to represent him at Trujillo. This officer interfered in the
                        contracts for the construction of the pier and railway, from which has
                        arisen grand difficulties, involving the interest of foreigners.</p>
                    <p>Briefly the facts are these: In 1872 the Government of Peru entered into a
                        contract with St. Larrañaga for the construction of the railway of Trujillo
                        and the pier at Salaverry, but being unable to fulfill its part of the
                        contract, in 1875 modified the contract; bonds, to be given to him in
                        proportion to the completed work, were issued to his order, which bonds were
                        to have been paid from the net proceeds of the works, and a small amount was
                        so paid. Floods in 1878 caused heavy damages to the road, and war supervened
                        in 1879. The works are in consequence incomplete. As to the validity of the
                        contracts there is no question, but Larrañaga fell into financial
                        difficulties.</p>
                    <p>The pier had been bargained for, as had locomotives and cars, but although
                        imported for delivery were not given over to Larrañaga from his inability to
                        make payment.</p>
                    <p>In 1881 the Chilian army seized the railway and took possession of the
                        locomotives and cars, still in the original cases in which they had been
                        imported, and applied them to use on the railway, their owners, Grace
                        Brothers &amp; Co., protesting against the right of seizure.</p>
                    <p>At the solicitation of Larrañaga the railway Was subsequently delivered to
                        him by the commander of the Chilian force in occupation, upon express
                        stipulation of payment to Grace Brothers &amp; Co. for the rolling stock
                        referred to.</p>
                    <p>In 1876 Grace Brothers &amp; Co. had purchased of the bonds issued on account
                        of these constructions an amount equal to 80,000 soles.</p>
                    <p>In July, 1883, Larrañaga made a contract of assignment for the benefit of
                        certain creditors named in the contract, and Grace Brothers &amp; Co., and
                        B. Valdeavellano were made receivers in behalf of themselves and other
                        creditors,</p>
                    <p>Larrañaga’s contract of 1875 made him the administrator of the road and pier,
                        under certain requirements as to the disposition of the proceeds for a
                        period of twenty years. At the expiration of this term the Government might
                        take possession upon condition of paying par for the bonds still unredeemed
                        from the portion of the road and pier earnings to be applied to their
                        payment, failing in which the works were still to remain in the management
                        of Larrañaga. The proceeds of the works were to be applied to the payment of
                        expenses, improvement, <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0511"/>and repairs,
                        and the interest and sinking fund for the bonds. The net proceeds were to be
                        divided, two-thirds for the Government and one third for Larrañaga.
                        Larrañaga’s assignment embraced his rights as administrator and those he had
                        acquired as contractor and manager. The parties were substituted, as
                        temporary administrators, as security to his creditors, and the contract is
                        terminated at any moment when Larrañaga can satisfy their claims. They are
                        under obligation to carefully fulfill the contract with the Government, and
                        to diligently prosecute the works.</p>
                    <p>Under this assignment, which it will be noted is in no sense a transfer of
                        the contract of Larrañaga with the Government, the pier has been in part
                        erected, the road improved and material purchased, <hi rend="italic">now en
                            route</hi> to Peru for the extension of the road.</p>
                    <p>In the month of August or about one month after the contract of assignment
                        had been made with Larrañaga, the delegate before referred to intervened in
                        the affairs of the road, and besides demanding immediate payment by the
                        receivers of 10,000 silver soles, and thenceforward of 3,000 soles per
                        month, undertook to modify Larrañaga’s contracts. These demands were paid
                        under protest.</p>
                    <p>On the 17th January last a decree was issued, followed by one dated the 23d
                        of the same month.</p>
                    <p>The first assumes that there is an attempt to hypothecate the road and impose
                        claims upon it injurious to the interests of the Government in the road and
                        pier, and that the contract between Larrañaga and his creditors required the
                        approval of the Government.</p>
                    <p>There is no foundation for either of these assumptions. The contract of
                        assignment in careful terms requires the exact fulfillment of the conditions
                        of his contract with the Government, and using the terms applied in the
                        contract, “to assign particularly and temporarily the interests and rights I
                        have acquired as contractor and manager.” There is not the least appearance
                        of an attempt to hypothecate the property in any form. This part of the
                        decree is therefore founded in error.</p>
                    <p>The right to transfer the contract of 1875 was reserved to Larrañaga,
                        conditioned upon its approval by the Government.</p>
                    <p>If there was any Government in Peru to approve or disapprove in July and
                        August last it was that of Montero at Arequipa.</p>
                    <p>But Larrañaga in his assignment to his creditors has not pretended to
                        transfer his contract, but has expressly provided that the temporary
                        assignment shall terminate at any time upon payment of his creditors. In
                        further proof of the nature of the contract it is noted that no provision is
                        made for the payment to Larrañaga of anything whatever for the interest
                        accruing to him through large investments made by him prior to the
                        assignment; only the portion of the net receipts falling to him is to be
                        applied by the receivers in liquidation of his debts and of the outlay by
                        his creditors in the completion of the pier and road.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of the contract was the completion of the pier and road with the
                        rolling stock and appliances necessary to their profitable employment. It
                        was therefore a contract in the interests of the Government, contractor, and
                        creditors.</p>
                    <p>The assumption of power on the part of the Government to intervene in the
                        assignment is certainly not warranted by any condition found in the
                        contracts of Larrañaga with the state or with his creditors.</p>
                    <p>The pier partially completed, and the cars and engines have never been
                        delivered to Larrañaga, but have been placed in use or construction upon the
                        faith of the contracts and the assignment. The Government has no right of
                        ownership, since it could acquire such only through <pb n="412"
                            xml:id="pg_412" facs="0512"/>its contractors, who was to acquire it
                        through the fulfillment of the assignment.</p>
                    <p>The further assertion in the decrees that the contract with Larrañaga’s
                        creditors is evidence of his inability to meet his responsibility for the
                        construction of the works is disproved by the very fact that the assignment
                        secured the prompt commencement of work upon the pier and the improvement of
                        the railway bed, the supply of needed rolling stock and the purchase of
                        materials for the prosecution of the construction and completion of the
                        road.</p>
                    <p>It will be observed that no provision is made in the decrees for the
                        refundment of the 10,000 soles paid to the delegate by the receivers or for
                        the material and rolling stock supplied, not property of Larrañaga or of the
                        Government, and never again into the possession of either.</p>
                    <p>The seizure of the road by the Government is in violation of the terms of the
                        contract with Larrañaga, it not having paid off the bonds as a preliminary
                        to any right of possession.</p>
                    <p>But its treatment only concerns the United States in so far as it injuriously
                        and wrongfully affects the interests of Americans believed to have been
                        acting in entire good faith.</p>
                    <p>The act of seizure and appointment of a manager in behalf of the Government
                        is an arbitrary exercise of power, illegal and unjustifiable, and one not
                        called for by any exigency of public welfare or safety.</p>

                        <p>P. S.—I have overlooked a portion of the last of the decrees and the
                            third article of the decree of the 17th of January.</p>
                        <p>It is quite apparent that a formal assignment by contract is a much more
                            complete and formal authorization to act in place of another than a
                            power of attorney, and that Grace and Valdeavellano have not proposed or
                            pretended to act as agents of Larrañga, but in their own right by virtue
                            of their contract with him, a contract not calling for the recognition
                            of the Government. The recognition or non-recognition cannot effect its
                            validity; and the terms of the contract do impose upon the receivers all
                            the responsibilities in the observance of the contract during their
                            continuance in the management which Larrañaga was under. That they were
                            supplied with funds is proven by the measures taken to complete pier and
                            roads.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Colonel Puga, in the north, who has for a long
                        time been in control at Caxamarca, the home, so to speak, of the Government
                        here, and who has been so often reported destroyed, has recently defeated
                        General Iglesias’ brother, taken Trujillo and Salaverry, seized the railway,
                        concerning which I have written in my No. 58, and it is further reported,
                        has overturned the established authorities of Iglesias at Lambayeque,
                        Pocasmayo, Puna, and other places. The Government troops appear to have gone
                        over to him with their arms, and the outlook for Iglesias in that section is
                        not at all encouraging.</p>
                    <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0513"/>
                    <p>A commissary in the Chilian army at Chorillos stated this morning that a
                        force is ordered to embark at once for the scene of Puga’s exploits to quell
                        the montoneros. I have no further evidence than the officer’s word.</p>
                    <p>Reports for some days have been circulating that two Chilian columns are
                        moving against General Caceres, one from this side and the other from Cuzco,
                        and it is perfectly clear that, unaided, Iglesias is unable to contend with
                        his two enemies of the north and central provinces, and that the Chilian
                        army alone supports him. It is at least a very singular condition of
                        affairs.</p>
                    <p>The elections for deputies to the National Assembly have been entirely
                        without significance, the nation in the main having stood aloof while there
                        have been no contests. The final board of supervision of the election
                        returns for the various localities of the department divided, part declaring
                        one set of candidates elected and the other portion returning the other
                        ticket. The rule in the election has been but one candidate and public
                        apathy, and I find myself unable to determine what proportion of districts
                        have elected deputies.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>Should the Chilians undertake to put down the enemies of Iglesias in the
                        north and elsewhere it becomes an acknowledgment of the absence of Peruvian
                        support for the Government which Chili established.</p>

                        has notified me of the election by the Assembly of Mr. Iglesias as
                        provisional President of Peru, and that the former members of the cabinet
                        remain in their several departments.</p>
                    <p>I telegraphed you thereupon, stating also that the answer to the joint
                        protest against the debt articles of the treaty of peace had not been
                        satisfactory, and that Pierola is expected to arrive on the 8th.</p>
                    <p>The Assembly yesterday resolved that the constitution of 1860, except as to
                        certain articles, should be considered in force provisionally. This removes

                            instant, intended to protest, in the name of the French Republic,
                            against articles 4, 6, 8, and 10 of the treaty of peace, signed the 20th

                            consider them as null and without force with respect to the citizens of
                            France.</p>
                        <p>You advise him also that an identical note has been sent, concerted
                            between the powers in interest, and close suggesting that the question
                            of the indebtedness of Peru be reserved until an amicable arrangement be
                            made between both Governments and the creditors, or that there be
                            proposed to the assembly convoked for the 1st of March a solution more
                            satisfactory, based upon a regard to the contracts.</p>
                        <p>Already in the conference which the undersigned had with your excellency
                            in this department, I spoke, among other things, of one to which regard
                            must be had before a reply can be given to the note.</p>
                        <p>Having regard for the eminent endowments of your excellency the
                            Government of the undersigned regarded your selection as envoy
                            extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary in Lima as an evidence of the
                            friendly sentiments which the noble French Republic entertains for Peru,
                            but if a minister be not invested with a diplomatic character before the
                            Government that receives him except by the presentation and reception of
                            his credentials, one cannot explain an act of such importance as the
                            protest without your excellency having first completed that requisite.
                            The undersigned has offered and continues offering your excellency all
                            possible facilities for the fulfillment of your mission in current
                            affairs, and has observed, and will continue to observe, all the
                            consideration due to your rank, but cannot tolerate the innovation
                            introduced by the French legation, much less so when treating of a
                            question sufficiently grave, as your excellency observes.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the note, the treaty to which your excellency alludes, has
                            not been <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0515"/>brought to the
                            attention of your Government because the opportunity has not presented
                            itself; it is still in the condition of a negotiation pending, reserved
                            by its very nature and private character from other.(Chancelleria?)
                            diplomatic offices with which it has no direct relation whatever.</p>
                        <p>A notification of it, or simply its publication by the Government of the
                            undersigned would have been premature and in violation of established
                            usage.</p>
                        <p>Peru enters into it by virtue of the right it possesses of governing
                            itself, aright recognized since early in the century, at the time of its
                            independence, by all powers, including the one your excellency so
                            worthily represents, and cannot accept foreign intervention without
                            violating its rights as a sovereign and independent state and without
                            abdicating their prerogatives, which it has respected and does respect
                            in all constituted nationalities; hence it may not give, nor feel itself
                            called upon to give, participation in the treaties it negotiates without
                            destroying the foundation of its own existence.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the debts which are the cause of your excellency’s
                            protest, originated in loans made by individuals whom the Government of
                            the undersigned did not think it necessary to ask their nationality;
                            these debts have never had an international character, thus, as to-day
                            it appears, part of them, at least, are in the hands of Frenchmen,
                            according to your excellency’s note, of which the undersigned does not
                            for a moment doubt, they may to-morrow, possibly within a few hours,
                            pass into the hands of Americans or Russians, or business men of
                            whatever nationality. Peru owes nothing to France, not as to the
                            Government or the state, consequently those loans cannot become the
                            subject of diplomatic intervention.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned does not wish, as it would offend your excellency’s
                            enlightened Government, to linger in pointing out here the grave
                            consequences that it might have upon the peace and external security of
                            all nations, were such doctrine to be sustained.</p>
                        <p>He will point out to you only that with it the doors would be opened for
                            reclamations and wars, which are precisely what modern international
                            laws are designed to avoid; the relations between countries exposed to
                            the fluctuations of the exchange would expose weak states to the mercy
                            of the strong, and, in the name of the new rule which precedent had
                            established as an international practice, one nation would be authorized
                            to disturb the peace of another. A like doctrine, which a just and
                            upright Government like that of your excellency cannot consent to, in
                            the course of unforeseen human events might place France herself in the
                            gravest dangers.</p>
                        <p>A few years since the English bondholders solicited the intervention of
                            Her Brittanic Majesty’s Government, and notwithstanding the exertions of
                            private gentlemen, made as such, the British foreign office
                            (Chancelleria?) denied the right of diplomatic intervention, as appears
                            from records in this office.</p>
                        <p>If such serious considerations do not convince the Government of your
                            excellency, and it should consider it necessary to sustain the protest,
                            the undersigned seizes the occasion to remind you that it is of public
                            notoriety that for more than four years Peru has not controlled the
                            hypothecated products.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding since the earlier days of the war of the Pacific, cargoes
                            of guano and saltpeter have passed over the seas without any opposition,
                            Peru even has asked at the proper moment, through its diplomatic or
                            consular agents, the embargo of these cargoes in European ports without
                            finding support on the part of the Governments which now protest. Under
                            these conditions diverse arrangements have been made between creditors,
                            and a public sale made of 1,000,000 tons of guano to which the
                            guarantees apply, without notice on the part of the Republic of France
                            or the other states. It has thus struggled alone, and for a long time,
                            to save these interests, and afterwards signed a treaty of peace,
                            because it was no longer in condition to continue the struggle.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, your excellency should not forget that in the outbreak of the
                            war the Peruvian Government was engaged in an advantageous arrangement
                            with its creditors; the guano and saltpeter more than sufficed for the
                            debts. If Peru later on has found itself obliged to despoil the nation
                            of the wealth which constituted the security, it has done so from the
                            need to regard its own preservation, which is the first obligation, as
                            it is the first right of a state; otherwise we should hold that war
                            should never cease without the complete submission or the total
                            destruction of one of the belligerents.</p>
                        <p>Such is the situation of Peru; and these are the reasons which alike
                            prevent it from accepting the protest or acceding to the desires of the
                            Government of the Republic of France. The undersigned will, when the
                            opportunity offers, submit the treaty of 20th October to the national
                            assembly, as it is his duty, together with the correspondence relating
                            thereto. I should at the same time assure your excellency that Peru on
                            its part will not omit any means looking to the continued maintenance of
                            its good relations with France; relations which it wishes to strengthen
                            as far as possible, equally in prosperity as in the hours of its
                            humiliation and misfortune.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Recently there was introduced in the assembly
                        an act declaring the contract with Henry Meiggs, for the construction of the
                        Oroya Railroad, &amp;c., to be forfeited, and directing the Government to
                        take possession of the road, plant, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>I wrote to you in No. 58, at some length, concerning this road and the
                        Trujillo road.</p>
                    <p>I may state here that so late as 1880 the Peruvian Government recognized the
                        validity of the Meiggs contract, made a new one with the then
                        representatives of Meiggs, and gave the right of transfer to any parties
                        whatever. The transfer was made in accordance therewith. The contract has
                        been complied with. The war and the occupation of Lima and the line of the
                        road by the enemy here, of course, prevented prosecution of work in
                        construction.</p>

                    <p>I should be pleased to receive instructions how to proceed in the event of
                        forcible proceedings in cases where I consider the contracts to be
                        unquestionably valid.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The mails brought the written instructions of
                        the several protesting Governments, and I have the honor to send you a copy
                        of the text in English, together with the reply of the Peruvian minister for
                        foreign affairs, with translation.</p>
                    <p>The ratifications of the treaty were duly exchanged in Lima on the 28th

                    <p>Meanwhile most of Peru appears to be in the control of Caceres and of bands
                        of Montoneros. Caceres has pushed his regular troops out upon the lines
                        towards the sea and it is reported that the Chilian troops beyond the
                        Cordillera have been ordered to this side.</p>
                    <p>The assembly adjourned on the 31st ultimo to meet the first day of March,
                        1885. As reported, it conferred dictatorial powers upon Iglesias and
                        continued its own existence.</p>
                    <p>General Iglesias, in remarks made to the assembly, said that he should, in
                        the exercise of the powers given him, regard the personal security and honor

                        <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>Government has learned with satisfaction that a treaty of peace has been
                            concluded between the Republics of Chili and Peru, which treaty, in
                            order to become binding, only requires to be ratified by the legislative
                            power in both countries. As a Congress will meet at Lima early in March,
                            the time approaches when the engagements agreed upon will be submitted
                            to the lawful representatives of Peru.</p>
                        <p>The text of the said convention, which has been made public through
                            various channels, contains stipulations which belong to two different
                            orders of ideas. Some are exclusively political and regulate the
                            respective situations of the contracting countries; these * * *
                            Government leaves out of consideration.</p>
                        <p>The others are relative to the debts of Peru, that is to say to the
                            rights of neutrals which are affected by the cession of a certain number
                            of provinces to the Republic of Chili; such are Articles IV, VI, VIII,
                            and X, of the treaty. * * * Government could not help taking notice of
                            the above-mentioned stipulations which interest * * * subjects in a
                            direct manner. It appears to * * * that they constitute a serious
                            derogation to the rules usually observed in such cases, and a breach of
                            the contracts which have been entered into between Peru and her
                            creditors, the object of the said clauses in sanctioning a cession of
                            territory in favor of one of the contracting parties being to free the
                            said territory from the obligations which weigh upon it in behalf of a
                            third party. They set aside various mortgages which form the special or
                            collective lien the creditors of Peru have upon the whole of the
                            valuable guano or nitrate deposits discovered or which may be discovered
                            in the ceded provinces. Under the circumstances and while experiencing
                            the sincere wish that the essential part of the treaty will be ratified
                            without delay, and that friendly relations between the two states will
                            be placed on a durable basis, * * * Government is of opinion that * * *
                            cannot allow the clauses of the treaty concerning the settlement of the
                            Peruvian debt to become obligatory without formally protesting against
                            them, and that * * * ought to consider them of no value as far as * * *
                            subjects are concerned. Therefore * * * insist upon the said clauses
                            being reserved with a view to a friendly understanding between the two
                            Governments and the interested parties being arrived at, or upon a more
                            satisfactory solution, which will guarantee the contracts with the
                            creditors being immediately submitted to the acceptance of the congress
                            which is about to meet in Lima. Moreover, they hope that the cabinets of
                            Santiago and Lima will, without difficulty, perceive the necessity of a
                            modification which will strengthen the credit of Peru and add to the
                            good name of Chili.</p>

                            signed by the European powers, which appear to have framed the protest
                            against some of the articles of the treaty of peace and friendship
                            concluded on the 20th of October, 1883, between Peru and Chili, which,
                            as you are aware, is already a law of the Republic, having been approved
                            by constituent national assembly and ratified by the executive
                            power.</p>

                            loyalty which has always characterized the international policy of Peru,

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have been compelled to protest decidedly
                        against a renewed attempt on the part of the Government to seize the
                        Trujillo railroad, and of the property afloat and ashore being landed by the
                        administrators, acting under an assignment by Larrañaga, as explained in my
                        No. 58.</p>
                    <p>The position I have taken is that the details of Larrañaga’s performance of
                        his contract do not affect the question; that the Governments of Peru,
                        whenever exercising control in that part of Peru, have recognized
                        Larrañaga’s contract; that Chili had recognized the validity of his contract
                        with his creditors, and had not, in consequence, seized and carried off the
                        property as had been done in the case of other roads; and that, even if
                        Larrañaga’s contract has been justly forfeited, or if his contract with his
                        creditors be invalid, these are matters to be determined by the proper
                        tribunals of the country, and that the United States cannot permit the
                        rights of their citizens to be assailed and their property seized upon the
                        decision of a minister of a government which is itself a party to the
                        contracts declared by that officer to have been forfeited; that there must
                        first have been a full, fair, and impartial hearing of the case by the
                        proper court of law, and the property be taken possession of in pursuance of
                        a decree of such court.</p>
                    <p>I trust that some understanding will now be reached satisfactory to the
                        American firm.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Yesterday I had the honor to telegraph you
                        concerning the rupture of negotiations between Chili and Bolivia, and the
                        protest of Bolivia against the continued occupation of the Mollendo-Puno
                        Railroad, by Chilian forces. Puno, upon Lake Titicaca, is, or was in
                        communication with the Bolivian side by means of small steamers. These were
                        seized by the Chilians, and all commercial intercourse with Bolivia by that
                        route interdicted.</p>
                    <p>Besides, the Chilians carried one or more torpedo boats by the railway to
                        Puno, and are otherwise prepared for aggressive warfare, from that railroad
                        terminus and lake port, upon Bolivia. It is not reasonable to suppose Chili
                        is disposed to give up this great advantage until peace is secured with
                        Bolivia.</p>
                    <p>As this now seems to be in peril—and I may add there are indications of
                        movements of Chilian troops upon Bolivia in the south—at this moment, the
                        forces would not be withdrawn from Peru, were it demanded by General
                        Iglesias.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: A few days since I telegraphed that the
                        negotiations for a truce between Chili and Bolivia had failed.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>Renewal of hostilities between Chili and Bolivia was expected by the
                        Government here and by the Chilians at headquarters. Preparations were
                        making. The Peruvian minister had returned from La Paz to represent to his
                        Government the feeling existing in Bolivia concerning the continued
                        occupation by the Chilians of Puno, and their stoppage of intercourse by
                        that route. These serious complications have been removed by the signature
                        of the truce, bereft, however, of two important provisions which it is known
                        were insisted upon by Chili, viz, exclusive trade of Bolivia with the
                        Pacific through the port of Arica, and the right to construct a railway from
                        the vicinity of Antofagasta to the interior of Bolivia. Chili doubtless
                        found it politic to recede.</p>
                    <p>Combinations looking to the submission of Caceres, coupled with an
                        influential support of the Government hoped for, failed, largely so because
                        of the pretensions of Chili to further indemnity in the event of having to
                        assume Peruvian indebtedness for Tarapacá.</p>
                    <p>I observed a feeling that, cost what it might, these parties thought it
                        necessary to assist Caceres with funds, that he might still retain the only
                        force in Peru that would protest against further spoliation. But the
                        Chilians are to attack him as soon as the rains pass, and he will be unable
                        to offer effective resistance.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Owing to departure on the day following the
                        presentation of my credential letters to the President of Peru, I have been
                        forced to write the report at sea and without number.</p>
                    <p>In accordance with your telegraphic instruction I received a visit from the
                        minister of foreign affairs of Peru, as did each other chief of a legation
                        authorized to accept the <hi rend="italic">amende</hi>, on the 23d instant,
                        in which he said he had come as an act of courtesy and to express the desire
                        of the Government to renew former diplomatic relations precisely as if
                        nothing had occurred to interrupt them, and that it was the wish of the
                        President that they might be cordial. Subsequently an official letter
                        informed me of the change in the cabinet. The next morning Mr. Gibbs
                        arrived, and, as arranged, he accompanied me to the reception for the
                        presentation of my credentials, which was a public one and quite
                        ceremonious. The German minister subsequently presented his telegraphic
                        authority to recognize the Government, the more formal reception to take
                        place when his letters arrive. Mr. Pinto, minister from Salvador and dean of
                        the corps, also recognized the Government the same day.</p>
                    <p>I presented Mr. Gibbs as minister to Bolivia, temporarily placed in charge of
                        the legation in Lima as well, during my absence upon urgent business.</p>

                            with the character of envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary
                            of the Republic of the United States of America, and also copy of the

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">President</hi>: By instructions from my
                            Government I have now the honor and pleasure to place in your hands the
                            letter of the President of the United States accrediting me as the
                            representative of my country near the Government of Peru.</p>
                        <p>The people and Government of the United States feel great solicitude for
                            the future welfare of Peru, desiring to see the nation fully resuming
                            its pursuits of peace, with all the enjoyment of the advantages and
                            happiness derived from industry, security, and the consequent’ general
                            prosperity. I venture to express the hope that your excellency may be
                            able to lay the foundation of a great and permanent progress, coupling
                            your name with it in the history of your country. Besides duties
                            connected with the interests of citizens of Switzerland and Colombia, I
                            am instructed to extend such aid as I can to the Chinese in this
                            country. Believing your excellency to be actuated by most humane motives
                            in respect to them, I shall seek an early occasion for consultation with
                            your Government, hoping for results as advantageous to Peru as to the
                            Chinese laborers. It will be my pleasure as well as my duty to cultivate
                            and extend the good relations that have always existed between the
                            United States and Peru, and it is my ambition to meet with success.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister</hi>: With the greatest pleasure I
                            receive the autograph letter that accredits you as envoy extraordinary
                            and minister plenipotentiary of the United States to the Government of
                            Peru, which felicitates itself through me on the official and solemn
                            continuation of diplomatic relations with the great Republic of the
                            north.</p>
                        <p>After a war terrible as unfortunate to our arms, whose adverse end the
                            most heroic sacrifices could not impede, it is to-day the great desire
                            of my Government to devote itself to the works of peace, seeking in them
                            the fruitful elements of reorganization and progress. With these
                            intentions I shall labor without ceasing to establish an honorable and
                            patriotic administration that will consolidate the rule of democratic
                            institutions and open a bright future to the commerce of all
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>I see with great satisfaction that you are authorized to look after the
                            interests of the citizens of Switzerland and of Colombia and for the
                            Chinese subjects residing in this country.</p>
                        <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0522"/>
                        <p>My Government takes pleasure to inform your excellency in respect to the
                            last that it is resolved to extend to them the protection that the
                            liberal laws of Peru give to all strangers without distinction of
                            nationality.</p>
                        <p>I am highly thankful for the sentiments that your excellency expresses
                            toward the people and the Government of Peru, and am happy to answer
                            them by wishing in the most fervent manner for the prosperity and glory
                            of the people and the Government of the Americans, and that the
                            relations of friendship that exist between our respective Governments
                            will remain unalterable.</p>
                        <p>Be assured that all facilities will be given you in the fulfillment of
                            the mission that has been confided to you, both as a representative of a
                            Republic so beloved by Peru and for the personal qualities that adorn
                            you.</p>
                        <p>You are thus recognized in your elevated character.</p>

                        rupture of negotiations between Chili and Bolivia, and the protest of

                        Chilian forces, are worthy of careful consideration.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Mr. Phelps’ No. 58, and later dispatches,
                        which you will find on iile in the legation at Lima, report the action of
                        the Peruvian authorities in issuing executive decrees declaring forfeited
                        certain railway and <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0523"/>other contracts
                        in which citizens of the United States are concerned, and providing for the
                        settlement of debts under such contracts by extrajudicial means.</p>
                    <p>It is thought unnecessary to analyze these operations in detail, inasmuch as
                        they rest on bases which this Government does not admit. This action assumes
                        to Peru the right to dictate a decision involving the rights of citizens of
                        the United States in contracts to which Peru is itself a party. We do not
                        recognize the competency of either party to a contract to void it at will
                        and enforce penalties on the other party.</p>
                    <p>I have to-day sent you a telegram to this effect, in the following words:

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my dispatch, No. 95, I informed the
                        Department that France had recognized this Government. Since then the
                        Argentine Republic has recognized, so that the Government of General
                        Iglesias has been acknowledged by all the principal powers of America and
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>On the 9th instant a decree was issued saying that the time for forbearance
                        and mercy had passed; that in the future all disturbers of the peace would
                        be severely punished and chastised, according to the laws of the Republic in
                        such cases.</p>
                    <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0524"/>
                    <p>On the same day another decree was published destroying what little there was
                        left of the freedom of the press, almost prohibiting any expression of
                        thought.</p>
                    <p>A few days afterward a decree was issued stating that the pecuniary resources
                        of the Government were in such a condition that the administration had to
                        resort to every manner possible toward creating funds, and it was therefore
                        ordered that all persons should take out passports to travel by land or sea
                        within the dominion of the Republic. A small amount, 20 cents silver, for
                        each passport to be collected.</p>
                    <p>Disturbances are taking place all over Peru where neither party has full
                        power, and troops sent out by this Government often desert.</p>
                    <p>In the latter part of April some cavalry left here to go to the north. They
                        were 150 in number, and arrived at Pocas Mayo on the 28th of the month
                        mentioned. On the night of the 1st instant they mutinied; ninety-three
                        deserted, taking their arms with them, killing the sentinel and one officer
                        and severely wounding the second in command.</p>
                    <p>At Huanuco, about 180 miles northeast of Lima, the Cacerists, with a body of
                        Indians, took possession of the place, murdering a number of Chinese and
                        sacking their stores. They also murdered the subprefect and others.</p>
                    <p>A few days afterward another party of Cacerists entered Huancayo, about 120
                        miles east of this city, took peaceable possession of the town, and
                        established their own authorities. The Cacerists or Montoneros, as they are
                        called, occupy nearly all of the province of lea on the coast. The line from
                        Mollendo to Peru, on the south, being held by the Chilians, all is quiet
                        there.</p>
                    <p>I have no doubt that whoever acknowledges the treaty made by Peru with Chili,
                        whether Caceres or another, would try to overthrow the present Government;
                        the Chilians would remain as spectators, and would not interfere save to
                        restrain outbreaks or mob law.</p>
                    <p>The Chilians are sending off their troops gradually, and have already sent
                        artillery, cavalry, one regiment of sappers, and another of infantry. The
                        cavalry horses are being sold as fast as possible, and everything looks like
                        an abandonment of the country.</p>
                    <p>If any important changes take place, I will report by cable.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have now to inform the Department of a very
                        important move toward the pacification of the Republic made by President
                        Iglesias, as you will see by the copy of the proclamation issued yesterday,
                        which I inclose; also translation. I surmise that General Iglesias has made
                        a virtue of necessity, and has done the best thing he could do under the
                        circumstances. The Chilians are fast evacuating the country, and before the
                        end of the month it is said the last of them would have left Peru. As there
                        is no doubt but their presence kept the present Government in power here at
                        Lima, the power of Caceres was increasing, and his forces were slowly and
                        gradually encircling this capital.</p>
                    <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0525"/>
                    <p>Puga, in the north, had taken and holds the port of Cosma. Zamudie holds all
                        of the province of lea excepting the port of Pisco La Colero did not return
                        to Ecuador, as reported, but is near Puno, and as soon as the last Chilian
                        leaves Puno and Arequipa, there is not the least doubt but the whole country
                        from Cuzco around down to Puno, Arequipa, and Mollendo will pass over and
                        recognize Caceres.</p>
                    <p>The papers of last night publish a correspondence between the Government and
                        Caceres.</p>
                    <p>On the 10th of June the minister of Government, Señor Osma, directed a
                        communication to General Caceres. After appealing to his patriotism he asks
                        what are his wishes, and stating his (Caceres) desires shall be granted as
                        far as is compatible with the honor and dignity of the Government, and that
                        the Government is disposed to do all possible to avoid further shedding of
                        blood among Peruvians, offering if it is necessary to go in person to have
                        an interview with Caceres, stating that he (Osma) would await with anxiety
                        so as to change the unhappy position of Peru to one of felicity and
                        prosperity.</p>
                    <p>General Caceres answers Osma’s letter from Huancayo June 19th applauding the
                        design and desires of the minister, and states that his wishes are: <list>

                                and in fulfillment of the treaty made by him to demand the immediate

                            <item>Caceres to accept and recognize the authority of said ministry.
                                Then General Caceres, in a lengthy document, gave his reasons for
                                the above demands. That the country, since the signing of the treaty
                                last October, desired to be free of the hated presence of a foreign
                                enemy; that it awaited with anxiety that this would have been the
                                first step of the Iglesias Government, but on the contrary the
                                Chilians had remained and by their bayonets sustained the actual
                                government which was more or less a protectorate; this fact was
                                degrading after the great concessions made in the treaty. A small
                                circle or clique had possession of the power of the nation against
                                the protest of the people. Suffrage had been suppressed, and the
                                nation deprived of its rights. In separating General Iglesias from
                                authority in the Republic it is natural that the new ministry could
                                call an election for a free expression of the people.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Caceres proposes, also, that General La Puerta could be called to power as he
                        was the legitimate vice-president of the Republic when Pierola made himself
                        dictator, and he might also convoke a call for election under the rule of
                        the constitution of 1860. He also appeals to the patriotism of Señor Osma to
                        assist him in carrying out this idea.</p>
                    <p>This correspondence was the cause of the visit of Armstrong to Caceres, and
                        of the coming of the commissioners to treat with Iglesias. The propositions
                        direct of Caceres were not admitted, but they are in fact, and to a great
                        extent, conceded in the proclamation inclosed.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday, with all the ceremony that is used in these South American
                        republics, the decree was published through the streets convoking new
                        elections as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Miguel Iglesias, provisional President of the Republic, says:
                                Considering that it is not necessary that the provisional regimen
                                should continue by this Government, <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426"
                                    facs="0526"/>which believes it has finished the task imposed on
                                it when it accepted the supreme command, decrees that an election
                                shall be held for President, Vice-president, deputies, and senators,
                                according to the constitution of 1860. Then follows the mode and
                                rules for the elections, the Congress to be installed December 9 of
                                this year.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The proclamation has been accepted by the press very favorably, and as far as
                        I can learn has been very well received by the people.</p>
                    <p>Orders have been sent to all parts to stop all military operations, and
                        yesterday a steamer left for Pisco to bring back the troops left there a few
                        days ago, as reported in my last note, and also orders were sent into the
                        interior to Prefect Mas and troops to return to this city.</p>
                    <p>Still I think that when the Chilians leave, attempts will be made to unseat
                        General Iglesias, as I doubt the county waiting until December to see the
                        result of the elections, as the anti-Iglesias party are the most
                        numerous.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">Miguel Iglesias, Provisional President of the Republic,
                            to the nation:</p>
                        <p>Fate made me the instrument to carry out the most difficult and painful
                            act that a soldier with abnegation, who defended his country on the
                            field of battle, could undertake.</p>
                        <p>Even when I proclaimed in the north the peace with Chili, I was not blind
                            to the great obstacles that I would find in my path, foreseeing in the
                            future rehabilitation and greatness. I braved the anger of those who
                            opposed me, and was not detained by the ingratitude of my
                            cotemporaries.</p>
                        <p>Convinced that peace was the only living idea, the spirit of all in the
                            calm hour of patriotic meditation, and the only hope or sentiment whose
                            warmth could free the country covered in all directions by smoking ruins
                            and ensanguined bodies of thousands of martyrs.</p>
                        <p>Impulsed by this saving thought, I arrived at the gates of this capital
                            surrounded by noble and willing companions. I signed the peace of Ancon,
                            thereby realizing my most vehement desire, which months previous was
                            considered by many as an act of lunacy, and by others as a page of shame
                            in the national history.</p>
                        <p>But in spite of all passions the flag, the symbol of our autonomy, waved
                            in the Peruvian metropolis, and at that moment of ineffable joy and
                            pleasing hopes I was gratified at the work of abnegation and sacrifice
                            that I had passed, and from that time I awaited calmly the verdict of
                            posterity. More, after finishing the heavy task to replace the clash of
                            arms by the beneficial action of labor, to return to the fields the men
                            who were occupied in the war. Another task more arduous, another object
                            more noble was called to perfect the undertaking which was reaching its
                            terminus, occupied all the attention of my thoughts and strength of
                            activity.</p>
                        <p>What did the Republic gain by international peace and the freedom of its
                            territory, if the blind hate of partisanship would again cover the soil
                            with blood and drive away for many years of disastrous agony a future of
                            happiness and progress?</p>
                        <p>Then it was necessary to consolidate the harmony of the Peruvian family,
                            to give a high example of disinterestedness and political abnegation,
                            founding at the same time an administration whose acts the country can
                            judge.</p>
                        <p>Fellow-citizens, if I have continued in this position, having accepted
                            the power that the constituent assembly trusted to me, I did so because
                            I did not consider it impossible to crown the noble mission which I
                            assumed in the bitter hours of profound despair believing, that as I had
                            put an end to the foreign war under the conditions the least onerous in
                            such difficult moments, I might bring back to the country the order and
                            stability of its institutions.</p>
                        <p>People of Peru, although not a single protesting act has been formed
                            against my Government, although I possess ample and powerful elements of
                            force, I will sacrifice all for conciliation.</p>
                        <p>I will leave the political stage resolutely and irrevocably, and from
                            this day forward, under the protection of the constitution of 1860,
                            which I declare to be in force, you may remain tranquil, and in
                            electoral combat you can name the citizen who will replace me.</p>
                        <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0527"/>
                        <p>When that is done, and I deliver to your representatives the power that I
                            hold, I will retire to my home with the tranquil spirit that accompanies
                            the man who has fulfilled his duties as a soldier and as an
                            executive.</p>
                        <p>This will be the last act of my political life, and thus believe I have
                            answered the confidence that I received from the nation.</p>
                        <p>If my abnegation is not sufficient to strengthen the foundations of
                            peace, yours will be the blame, if you do not know whom to elect with
                            coolness as the person worthy of directing your destiny.</p>
                        <p>Compatriots, I promise you by the word of a gentleman and soldier you
                            shall have all the liberty conceded by the law to exercise that most
                            precious right a free people can have, the right of suffrage.</p>
                        <p>The public force shall be no obstacle, only a worthy assistant to the
                            free expression of your will, and my complete and irrevocable
                            renouncement of the election is on© more pledge of the loyalty of my
                            intentions.</p>
                        <p>People of Peru, never forget that respect to law and authority is the
                            first base of the greatness of nations. Divided in the past, we could
                            not obtain victory on the battle-field. Occupied to-day in fratricidal
                            struggles, spilling precious blood not shed by a foreign enemy, each day
                            weaker, we will see the Republic humiliated by the odious tyranny of
                            disorder and an easy prey to foreign ambition.</p>
                        <p>To improve the realization of this scene of destruction and shame is what
                            has obliged me to take the step which I now inform you of. I expect the
                            assistance of all to put in practice this unity which is the salvation
                            of Peru.</p>
                        <p>I gave you external peace, and to-day, sacrificing all that to me is
                            personal, I lay the foundation for internal peace.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: * * * A decided change in policy has arisen,
                        the leading men of the Civil party having been banished from Lima, and
                        strict regulations are now enforced, the people being interdicted from
                        appearing upon the streets after certain hours, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile General Caceres, who occupies about all the ports and territory of
                        Peru, is reported encamped in an apparent state of inactivity at a station
                        upon the Oroya railway, not distant from Lima, his outposts coming to within
                        8 miles of the city. His force of disciplined troops is variously reported
                        at from 1,200 to 4,000 men, accompanied by a large number of irregularly and
                        insufficiently armed Indians. The maintenance of this force in a mountain
                        defile must be extremely difficult.</p>
                    <p>An attack is daily looked for, but I question if the Government itself is
                        very well informed as to the strength or movements of its enemy. It was
                        proposed through the commission before referred to, that Caceres should
                        nominate the prefects of the departments, the appointments to be made by
                        Iglesias; that the Lima cabinet should be arranged satisfactorily for
                        Caceres, and, finally, that Iglesias would not become a candidate for
                        election to the Presidency. The field was thus to be left free for the
                        election of Caceres, who was to retire to the interior and peaceably await
                        the event, the hope being that bloodshed and civil war might thus be
                        avoided.</p>
                    <p>These proposals were declined by Caceres upon an apparently insufficient
                        pretext, an act that has deprived him of many supporters and admirers. His
                        motives are not comprehended, as it was clearly not <pb n="428"
                            xml:id="pg_428" facs="0528"/>practicable for Iglesias to offer him
                        anything more, except by an absolute abdication in his favor of the office
                        of President.</p>
                    <p>The delay in attack by Caceres has been as advantageous to the Government as
                        injurious to his interests.</p>
                    <p>A dash at the outset would have given him the city with little resistance,
                        but now the Government feels that it has gained much in strength in its
                        armed force as well as in popular support. It has, as claimed, 4,500
                        well-armed and, what is of as much consequence, well-paid troops.</p>
                    <p>It is reported that the people of Arequipa have revolted and received a
                        representative of Caceres in place of the Government prefect, driven out.
                        Mollendo has declared for Caceres, and Puno had already done so;
                        consequently all the south of Peru, as well as the north and central
                        sections, is in the control of that chief, and Iglesias is confined
                        practically to the limit of Lima and Callao and their vicinity.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my No. 129 was given the condition of
                        affairs as understood on the 20th of August.</p>
                    <p>The then reported revolt at Arequipa was confirmed, and it is stated the
                        troops dispersed, taking their arms. This event completed the control of
                        Caceres over all Peru except Lima, Callao, and their vicinities. Meanwhile
                        he was in the valley of the Rimac, a few miles above Lima.</p>
                    <p>Several minor engagements occurred between his irregular (Montoneros) forces
                        and the Government troops during the intervening days to the time of the
                        attack on this city, resulting in directing the attention of the Government
                        to the northern side, and in consequence the attack from the opposite side
                        was a complete surprise.</p>
                    <p>It appears that Caceres left his position on the Rimac at a station on the
                        Oroya Railroad with about fifteen hundred men, one thousand or thereabouts
                        being trained and experienced troops.</p>
                    <p>Crossing the mountains to the southward, he entered the plain upon that side
                        of Lima, intending to pass between the city and Miraflores, <hi
                            rend="italic">en route</hi> to attack Callao. In the darkness of a foggy
                        and misty night, so frequent at this season, his guides became confused in
                        the various roads early in the evening, and the force, already weary with
                        long marching and want of food, wandered about until midnight, with the
                        result that about 3 a. m. it came in collision with a picket guard of the
                        Government stationed in the outskirts of the capital.</p>
                    <p>The attempt to surprise Callao was necessarily abandoned, and the attack was
                        perforce turned upon Lima.</p>
                    <p>The cuartel of San Guadalupe was captured, and by 6 a. m. the streets of Lima
                        had become the scene of a desultory fight and the firing had become general,
                        a number of bullets striking or entering the legation house.</p>
                    <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0529"/>
                    <p>There was apparently no organized and studied plan of operations. General
                        Caceres unquestionably had been persuaded that he had but to make the attack
                        to have the Government troops passing over to his side and to find himslef
                        fortified by an uprising of the pueblo. He had been advised that all was
                        prepared, and importuned to come to Lima.</p>
                    <p>There was no popular movement in his favor, and the Government troops did not
                        pass over to his support.</p>
                    <p>It was apparent that had he made the Government house, or so-called palace,
                        his sole object of attack, and had he entered with scaling ladders and a
                        force assigned to the assault, he would have carried the place, captured the
                        President, his cabinet and officers, and become master of all Peru without a
                        loss in men as great as that experienced. At 8 o’clock he was in possession
                        of the larger part of the city, but his failure was already manifest, for
                        his men were moving about without concert of action or intelligent
                        leadership.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>Caceres himself was but a short time in the city. He had been quick to
                        discover the want of popular support and of disloyalty in the Government
                        troops, and, accompanied by a small escort, went by way of Lima back to the
                        mountains. His people, except those who occupied church towers, had left the
                        city by noon. The Government troops, taking courage, followed them to the
                        suburbs, making many prisoners.</p>
                    <p>All of Caceres’ troops became scattered and routed. Exhausted from fatigue
                        and hunger, they were incapable of an organized retreat, or indeed of
                        further efforts, and this, more than the opposition of the Government
                        forces, led to the disaster. The people in the church towers resisted till 2
                        p.m., then surrendering.</p>
                    <p>Caceres is said to have gone, with a small force retained at his former
                        position on the Oroya Railroad, over the Cordillera to Tarma, and, it is
                        presumed, will reach Arequipa as quickly as possible. Once there he will be
                        in command of men and of resources. Meanwhile the Government has dispatched
                        two steamers with troops to the south, possibly to Mollendo.</p>
                    <p>The explanation of this turn of events is to be mainly found in the support
                        given by Pierola to Iglesias. The ex-dictator has great influence with the
                        lower classes of Lima, this being the order relied upon in aid of
                        revolutionary outbreaks.</p>
                    <p>Had Caceres pushed on to Lima, continuing to closely follow up the Chilians
                        as they left the line of the Oroya Railroad to embark for home, he would
                        have had little to contend with in Lima. The delay gave time to perfect the
                        accord with Pierola and to strengthen the Government, as well as to banish
                        the most influential of Caceres’ adherents.</p>
                    <p>It is difficult to form conclusions as to what is likely to result from this
                        triumph of Iglesias, but it might naturally be expected to lead to a
                        protracted civil war were it not for the uncertainties arising in the
                        intrusion of Pierola into the problem.</p>
                    <p>The plans of that clever leader must be understood as a basis for judgment,
                        and of these the public knows very little indeed.</p>
                    <p>The Government, however, has already entered upon a course of fines and
                        imprisonment not likely to conduce to harmony, or peace, or confidence, or
                        even to a permanent government.</p>
                    <p>The city and surrounding country have been orderly and quiet since the day of
                        the fight, but apprehension and sadness and stagnation, have full
                        possession.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Government, since its triumph of the 27th
                        ultimo, has apparently been gaining in strength and in adherents.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>The Government is now in possession of lea. The port of Mollendo is closed to
                        shipping by order, and the English steamship company, about the only
                        ship-owners in interest, submit to the paper blockade.</p>
                    <p>As the Government exercises a rigid scrutiny of cablegrams, no news from
                        Arequipa can reach us, Mollendo being closed, and we know nothing of what is
                        being done in that stronghold of Caceres. A story was in circulation that
                        the general is lying dangerously sick at a hacienda in the interior, but it
                        is probably false.</p>
                    <p>Fifteen hundred troops, accompanied by the Secretary of War, have gone by sea
                        to the north to <hi rend="italic">pacify</hi>—using the expression common
                        here—that section of the country; in other words, to depose Dr. Puga and
                        establish the power of the Government.</p>
                    <p>Troops have also gone to Junin, in the interior, from here.</p>
                    <p>A strict censorship of the press completely cuts off information from the
                        public, and we hear nothing of late of events outside of Lima, or, at least,
                        nothing which the Government does not wish should be known.</p>
                    <p>What must be regarded as accidental, or, perhaps, more correctly, as a
                        success due purely to want of intelligent command in General Caceres on the
                        27th of July, has apparently greatly changed the face of affairs over the
                        larger part of Peru. We can only hope as yet that it has been for the
                        best.</p>

                        preventing information of its military operations and political acts, away
                        from the capital, from reaching the public. Two weeks have elapsed since the
                        force went north, and nothing is so far known of its operations. The
                        censorship of the press is closely maintained.</p>
                    <p>I had information from Arequipa indirectly a few days since. Up to that date
                        all was quiet and business entirely arrested by the stoppage of commerce at
                        Mollendo, which port is still subject to a paper blockade.</p>
                    <p>Caceres, it is supposed, is now there.</p>
                    <p>In Lima all remains quiet and orderly, but all its industries, like those of
                        all Peru, are prostrated, and seemingly not soon to be reestablished.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Since my last communication the Government has
                        largely concealed its doings from the public. Soldiers in some force have
                        been sent over the mountains in the direction of Huancayo, where, as I learn
                        from an American recently arrived, there were 800 very well-armed and
                        disciplined troops of Caceres, being a reserve force not engaged in the
                        fight in this city on July 27. No doubt the existence of that force accounts
                        for the activity in sending men in that direction.</p>
                    <p>On the 6th of September Caceres, being at Ayacucho, issued a proclamation
                        stating his purpose to continue war against Iglesias; says he will be at the
                        head of a respectable army in Arequipa, and will renew the war from thence.
                        He must be a man of some power since all who come in contact with him
                        believe in his capability and destiny. I notice this in case of the
                        foreigners employed on the trains captured by Caceres.</p>
                    <p>In the north it is said Puga is prepared to resist the Government force, but
                        our knowledge in that regard is meager.</p>
                    <p>In Lima and vicinity quiet and peace reign, except for suspects and those
                        against whom the Government gets information, but confidence does not
                        increase and hopes for. the future do not brighten.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The political situation has not changed
                        materially since the 24th ultimo.</p>
                    <p>The Government forces in the north, it is reported, have suffered reverses at
                        Pocasmayo, and Dr. Puga is out with a proclamation setting forth his purpose
                        to defend Trujillo and maintain the Caceres standard in the north.</p>
                    <p>From trustworthy sources it is learned that Puga has cast field guns from
                        church bells, and otherwise prepared for the attack upon Trujillo, and that
                        he has from 1,200 to 1,500 armed men. There are reports of the defeat of a
                        second force of Government troops sent to Pacasmayo. At the same time it is
                        announced that the troops will march against Puga at once.</p>
                    <p>Much for the future of the Iglesias Government will depend upon the issue of
                        the fight.</p>
                    <p>At Puno the commander of the Government forces, in emulation of like doings
                        at lea and other places occupied, has levied military fines upon all persons
                        sympathizing, or supposed to sympathize, with Caceres, and who have
                        property, the fines being in varied amounts per individual, up to 20,000
                        silver soles.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Clark, consular agent at Puno, has been fearful of an assessment upon
                        him. The people of Trujillo are reported to have been firmly <pb n="432"
                            xml:id="pg_432" facs="0532"/>united for the defense of their city under
                        Puga in consequence of these military persecutions by Government troops at
                        other places and the fear of heavy exactions upon them should the Government
                        obtain possession.</p>
                    <p>It is also said that Caceres has been enthusiastically received at Arequipa,
                        and that 1,800 armed men awaited his arrival.</p>
                    <p>Wherever the Government troops are in well-established possession there order
                        exists, although coupled with something like terrorism.</p>

                            inform you of a circumstance that occurred in this vicinity, and of the
                            death of Mr. Owen Young, an American citizen, a native of the State of
                            Georgia.</p>
                        <p>During the late movements of the forces of the Iglesias Government and
                            the Montoneros, under command, or in the interest, of Puga, the
                            Montoneros made their rendezvous in the hacienda “Tecapa,” where the
                            deceased has been living for a number of years past in a little house
                            belonging to himself, in a field some distance from the buildings of the
                            plantation and near the railway. The deceased was engaged in planting
                            rice, corn, and having, also, contracts for supplying wood for the use
                            of the Pacasmayo Railway.</p>
                        <p>On September 27 a skirmish took place between the troops of Iglesias and
                            the Montoneros at a distance of nearly a mile from the house of the
                            deceased. The Montoneros were forced to retire, and retreated in the
                            direction of and passing the house of Young. When the troops of Iglesias
                            came to the house they commenced beating a Chinaman servant of Mr.
                            Young, who then came out of his house and remonstrated with the
                            soldiers, saying that the Chinaman was his servant and had nothing to do
                            with the Montoneros. A soldier on horseback then addressed Young, saying
                            in effect that <hi rend="italic">he had consented to the Montoneros
                                being in that vicinity and was as bad as any of them</hi>. Without
                            awaiting any reply and without any act of resistance or hostility on the
                            part of Young, the soldier shot him through the chest, causing instant
                            death.</p>
                        <p>The persons who witnessed the act are the following: Acha (Chinaman),
                            Santiago Marchiná, Manuel Contreras, José Arroyo, Pedro Ascurra, Paula
                            Huanila, Angel Pairasaman, Francisco Ascurra, and Miguel Espinoza, and
                            all of them are ready and willing to testify to the facts as
                            substantially stated by me.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Young was an honest, peaceable, industrious man, respected and
                            esteemed by all who knew him. He has lived in Peru a number of years,
                            and leaves two children, now grown up; also some property. At the time
                            he was shot the American flag was hoisted over his little house, to
                            indicate his neutrality.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Government is expecting information to-day
                        or to-morrow of the result of the movement of its forces against Trujillo,
                        where the Caceristos have been awaiting attack, but they had meanwhile
                        revolted against Dr. Puga, deposing him, and calling one Elias to the chief
                        command. This is said to have strengthened them with the people of Trujillo,
                        who had become greatly dissatisfied with Puga while opposed to this
                        Government and in entire sympathy with Caceres. Elias is one of the men
                        recently banished by the Government from Lima. He is said to have 1,600 men
                        with few rounds of ammunition, and the Government 1,800 men with abundance
                        of supplies.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The movements of the Government forces in the
                        north of Peru culminated on the 10th instant in the capture of Trujillo,
                        about five hundred of the combatants having been killed and wounded.
                        Repulsed <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0534"/>in the first attack the
                        commander of the Government troops, Lorenzo Iglesias, brother of the
                        President, appears, beyond doubt, to have encouraged his men to renew the
                        attack on the 10th instant by a promise of several hours’ of pillage, and
                        the city was the scene of destruction and plunder accordingly. An American
                        citizen, robbed of money, in his claim refers, as a witness of the act, to
                        the commander of regiment No. 9, to whom appeal for protection was made.
                        There was a small fight at Chiclayo last week. Puga, who was deposed by his
                        officers from the command at Trujillo and was thought to have fled the
                        country, now turns up in the interior in command of four hundred men. There
                        are other people in arms, but mostly are to be regarded as marauding bands,
                        hostile to peace and government. In the interior it would seem that the
                        Government is extending its limits of control, although bands of armed men
                        spring up in unaccountable ways in every direction. A commission has gone,
                        or is to go, south, ostensibly to treat with Caceres, the Government being
                        wholly unequal to an attack upon him at Arequipa. It is altogether probable
                        the purpose of the commission is quite as much to discover and to foment
                        dissensions in that section as to propose terms for a settlement of the
                        unhappy strife in the country. We are favored with long lists of fines
                        imposed by the military commanders upon the inhabitants of towns occupied,
                        and it may be safely asserted that a Government without an influential
                        following in the country—without popularity or public confidence, supported
                        largely by the recent national enemy in supplies of arms, clothing,
                        munitions, &amp;c., and enabled to maintain itself through the general
                        prostration, is pursuing a risky course for the restoration of peace and the
                        consolidation of its power. The events of Trujillo have unquestionably
                        produced a most unfavorable impression in the country and weakened the
                        Government.</p>

                        <p>We declare that after the rout and flight of the Montoneros we saw the
                            late Don Owen Young alive and well, and that on the arrival of some
                            soldiers of the Government force at the house or rancho of said
                            gentleman, they commenced to maltreat the Asiatic Aehá servant of Mr.
                            Young, and when said Young said to them “they ought not to maltreat his
                            servant,” one of the soldiers of cavalry gave him a shot from his rifle;
                            the ball entered the breast of Mr. Young and killed him instantly.</p>
                        <p>We declare, that the late Don Owen Young gave no cause whatever, neither
                            by act nor word, by which the soldier might have been provoked to
                            proceed in the manner he did.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the late Young had at the instant hoisted above his rancho an
                            American flag, a sign that he was neutral and was not taking part with
                            either one of the contending parties.</p>

                            judge us, that this declaration is true in all its parts.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Diario do Governo of the 15th instant,
                        contains a printed copy of a contract just made by the Portuguese Government
                        for the construction of a railroad from the port of Lourenço Marques, which
                        will traverse the extreme southern portion of the Portuguese province of
                        Mozambique, east coast of Africa, to the frontier of the state of Transvaal,
                        in the immediate vicinity of Pretoria, its capital, a distance of about 50
                        miles.</p>
                    <p>This concession is granted to an American citizen, Mr. Edward McMurdo, in
                        behalf of an association composed in part of Mr. George S. Sedgwick and
                        other citizens of the United States, who, it is understood, have associated
                        with them a number of foreign capitalists in the enterprise. The
                        concessionaire binds himself to have the road completed and in running order
                        within three years of the date of the concession, which is for ninety-nine
                        years. The sum of £5,000 has been deposited with the Portuguese Government
                        as forfeiture money in the case, and another deposit of £10,000 is to be
                        made within a specified date to assure the carrying out of the contract.</p>
                    <p>Liberal grants of land are made to the railroad company as bonus, amounting
                        to 250,000 acres, and also a zone on either side of the road of 500 meters,
                        with land for docks and stations, and forest timber for construction,
                        &amp;c. The company is accorded freedom from taxation and freedom from
                        customs on all material for the use of the road during a period of fifteen
                        years.</p>
                    <p>The port of Lourenco Marques, on Delagoa Bay, considered the finest and
                        safest on the eastern coast of Africa, had been claimed by the <pb n="438"
                            xml:id="pg_438" facs="0538"/>British Government in its entirety, or at
                        least in joint occupancy with Portugal, the latter, however, resisting the
                        claim on the ground of prior discovery. These differences were submitted in
                        1873 to the arbitrament of the French Republic, and in 1875 President
                        McMahon confirmed the right of possession to the Portuguese.</p>
                    <p>In 1879 a convention was entered into between Portugal and Great Britain by
                        which the latter bound itself to construct a railway over the same route as
                        now proposed by the new concession, the road to be international. This
                        convention was signed by Senhor Corvo, the Portuguese minister of foreign
                        affairs at that time, and Mr. Morier, the then British minister at Lisbon;
                        but such was the dislike in the public mind to the proposed concession to
                        British interests and convenience that it was virtually rejected by the
                        Cortes, which failed to take up the convention when it was presented for
                        their approval.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>At present the entire commerce of the port of Lourenço Marques amounts to
                        less than $300,000 annually. But it is assumed that the proposed railroad
                        now contracted for, connecting with other projected roads traversing the
                        great Transvaal region and securing a development of its rich mineral and
                        other resources, will create a great and important volume of commerce from
                        this port. At all events, there is reason for congratulation that by means
                        of the road to be constructed over Portuguese territory to the Transvaal
                        that great region will be thrown open to the civilizing influences of
                        commerce, as it is also a source of satisfaction that the promised
                        amelioration of Central Africa will be largely due to the courage and
                        enterprise of citizens of the United States.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Portugal has made considerable and commendable
                        progress in educational achievement during the past fifteen years.</p>
                    <p>A stimulus was given to this paramount interest of the state in 1869 by the
                        testamentary appropriation of a large sum—£150,000, I am informed—by the
                        late Count Ferreira, of Oporto, for charitable and educational purposes in
                        this kingdom. This included provision for the construction of one hundred
                        and twenty school-houses in needy districts.</p>
                    <p>Then the Government directed its efforts with more efficiency than ever
                        before to the important duty of making additional provisions for the
                        education of the children of the state.</p>
                    <p>Primary instruction as now existing in Portugal is based upon the decree of
                        May 2, 1878, modified somewhat by subsequent legislation. The primary
                        schools are intended for the instruction of children of both sexes, and are
                        divided into two classes, namely, primary and advanced primary. They are for
                        the most part under district control, and sustained by district
                        contributions. Attendance at the primary schools is obligatory, unless
                        evidence is adduced that the children receive instruction at home or reside
                        at a greater distance than 2 kilometers from <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439"
                            facs="0539"/>the public school. In case of non-attendance without the
                        above valid excuses, parents or guardians are subject to fine. The primary
                        schools are intended for all children from six to twelve years of age. As a
                        rule every parish must have an elementary school, but in cases where the
                        children of adjoining parishes do not exceed sixty in number, then one
                        school may be organized for two or more parishes.</p>
                    <p>The parochial authorities are required to furnish house, books, and furniture
                        for the school and residence for the teacher, and to pay the latter 100
                        millreis annually in rural districts, 120 in towns, and 150 in Lisbon and
                        Oporto. In addition to this compensation, the teacher is entitled to 5 cents
                        monthly for each pupil under his instruction, and 2 millreis for each pupil
                        passing successfully the final examination in the elementary branches, and
                        further, for every six years of acceptable service an advance of 25 per
                        cent, on the salary. There is also a pension system of small allowance for
                        “retired teachers.”</p>
                    <p>In the primary school boys are taught reading, writing, arithmetic, elements
                        of grammar, of the metrical system, rudiments of drawing, “moral and
                        Christian doctrine”—the latter excepted in the case of children not
                        Catholics. The same tuition for girls with the addition of needle-work.
                        Mixed schools are to be instructed by married teachers, a lady to teach
                        needle-work. Boys may be taught by teachers of either sex.</p>
                    <p>In each district there shall be <hi rend="italic">an advanced primary
                            school</hi>, to be sustained by the municipality thereof; teachers of
                        these schools to be paid at least 180, and in Lisbon and Oporto 200 millreis
                        per annum, receiving also 2 millreis for every pupil passing into a higher
                        school. The “advanced primary” teaching for boys includes: 1, reading and
                        recitation in prose and verse; 2, writing and written exercises; 3,
                        arithmetic and elementary geometry; 4, grammar; 5, legal system of weights
                        and measures; 6, elements of cosmography, geography, and Portuguese history;
                        7, sketching; 8, moral and sacred history; 9, elements of hygiene; 10,
                        elements of agriculture; 11, gymnastics; 12, choral singing; 13, rights and
                        duties of citizens. For the female sex same as above from 1 to 9, inclusive,
                        with lessons upon the duties of a mother; also embroidery, making patterns,
                        taking measures, and lace and flower work. There shall be a regular
                        assistant for every sixty pupils. The municipalities are to appoint the
                        teachers and pay them.</p>
                    <p>There should be in Lisbon and Oporto two normal schools for qualifying
                        teachers of either sex. Each school shall have forty pupils of either sex,
                        who shall be entitled to 7 millreis monthly for maintenance, the same to be
                        paid by the district. There shall be in other districts, normal schools of
                        the second class to the number of ten. The state will appoint and pay
                        inspectors and subinspectors.</p>
                    <p>In towns having more than one school, the municipality is authorized to
                        establish “central schools,” with three or four teachers for each one. The
                        establishment of evening and Sunday schools for adults is enjoined upon the
                        various municipalities as a duty. In every district there shall be a school
                        committee to aid the municipality, and in every parish a parochial delegate.
                        There shall be conferences of teachers in each district annually.</p>
                    <p>The Government will give annually prizes of 100 and 200 millreis to students;
                        it will provide books by public competition every five years. It will aid
                        the parochial assemblies in the creation of a school fund to assist the
                        municipalities in the payment of teachers, in the establishment of evening
                        and Sunday schools, in the establishment of “kindergartens” for children, to
                        enlarge educational institutions, to establish <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440"
                            facs="0540"/>libraries, and to bestow prizes upon the deserving teachers
                        and worthy pupils, to secure pensions for poor scholars who may enter the
                        normal schools, to provide proper instruments for instruction in the natural
                        sciences, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>Secondary instruction is given in institutions of three classes according to
                        the decree of June 14, 1880, namely, central lyceums, national lyceums, and
                        secondary municipal schools.</p>
                    <p>There is a central lyceum in Lisbon, in Oporto, and in Coimbra; in the
                        capitals of other districts there is a national lyceum. All these are
                        supported by the state. Other municipalities may upon petition open
                        secondary municipal schools, they paying two-thirds and the state one-third
                        of the cost of their support. The object of these lyceums is to prepare
                        pupils for admission into schools of superior instruction. The course in the
                        central lyceum embraces: (1) Portuguese language; (2) French language; (3)
                        Latin; (4) geography, cosmography, universal and natural history; (5)
                        architecture, geometry, algebra, bookkeeping; (6) elements of physics,
                        chemistry, and natural history; (7) elements of civil legislation, of
                        Portuguese law, and political economy; (8) drawing; (9) national literature;
                        (10) natural and moral philosophy and laws of nature; (11) algebra,
                        geometry, and trigonometry; (12) physics and chemistry; (13) Latin; (14)
                        Greek; (15) English; (16) German.</p>
                    <p>There are taught in the scondary schools: (1) Portuguese; (2) French; (3)
                        arithmetic and geometry; (4) drawing; and there maybe one or two
                        professional chairs. No pupil under ten years of age is to be admitted to
                        the lyceums.</p>
                    <p>No school for private instruction by individuals can be opened without
                        informing the supervisor of the district.</p>
                    <p>The teachers of central lyceums shall receive an annual salary of 600
                        millreis; of the national lyceums 500; the rector of the central lyceums,
                        200; of the national lyceums, 150, and the teachers of secondary municipal
                        schools, 200, with some additional fees for scholars and upon successful
                        examination of latter.</p>
                    <p>The centers of superior education are Lisbon, Oporto, and Coimbra. The
                        university at Coimbra has faculties of law, theology, mathematics, medicine,
                        and philosophy or natural sciences.</p>
                    <p>In Lisbon there are the polytechnic school, the army and navy medical and
                        surgical schools, school for superior course of literature, commercial and
                        industrial school, general institute of agriculture, and an academy of fine
                        arts.</p>
                    <p>There exist in every diocese of the Kingdom institutions for ecclesiastical
                        learning.</p>
                    <p>At Oporto there are a polytechnic academy, an agricultural college, and an
                        academy of fine arts. Near Cintra there is also an agricultural college with
                        an experimental farm.</p>
                    <p>I have presented an analysis of the laws on the subject of education in
                        Portugal. The system embraces a wide and extended field, with a great deal
                        of machinery for its working, and, though it is imperfectly operated in many
                        cases, the fact is conceded that decided educational advancement has been
                        made in this Kingdom since the enactment of those laws.</p>
                    <p>No reliable statistics of the attendance of children at the public primary
                        schools can be obtained. I have seen a statement that in 1875–’76 (before
                        the adoption of the existing law enforcing attendance) there were in the
                        Kingdom and adjacent islands 141,466 children attending school. This, I am
                        assured, was incorrect, and to my inquiries in regard <pb n="441"
                            xml:id="pg_441" facs="0541"/>to the number now in attendance I am told
                        in the proper official department that no statistics can be furnished which
                        would be other than vague estimates.</p>
                    <p>It is a truth, however, that the want of school-houses is severely felt
                        throughout the Kingdom, that those existing are uncomfortably crowded, and
                        that in the city of Lisbon the want is painfully felt. However, gradually,
                        but too slowly it is feared, buildings are provided for this purpose to meet
                        the growing necessity.</p>
                    <p>The criticism I have heard pronounced upon the educational system of Portugal
                        is that it expends its greatest forces upon higher education and fails to
                        provide as good schools as should be maintained for elementary
                        instruction.</p>
                    <p>As to expenditures for education by the Government (not including the larger
                        local contributions for this purpose), it may be stated that under the head
                        of “public instruction” there was appropriated in the budget of 1883–’84,
                        934,762 millreis for the following purposes: <table rows="7" cols="3">

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: After a brief prorogation from the 29th
                        December, His Majesty Dom Luiz opened on the 2d instant the new session of
                        the Cortes with all the form and ceremony invariably observed on this
                        important occasion.</p>
                    <p>I have the honor to inclose a copy of His Majesty’s speech delivered at the
                        opening of the Cortes, with a translation thereof, and enumerate briefly
                        such of His Majesty’s remarks as appear to me important.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty mentions the continuance of friendly relations with foreign
                        powers; alludes to the recent conclusion of a treaty of commerce with Spain;
                        speaks with gratitude of the reception His Majesty and family met with on
                        their recent visit to that Kingdom, and as well for the universal evidence
                        of sympathy exhibited for his son during the prince’s recent journey.</p>
                    <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0542"/>
                    <p>His Majesty enumerates various projects of law and conditional contracts
                        which were under discussion during the late session; among them are
                        prominent the measures tending to constitutional reform, and several
                        concessions for railways, that of Lourenço Marques, which formed the subject
                        of my No. 103, being mentioned in common with others.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty further announces the intended presentation to the Cortes by his
                        Government of other important measures, such as the revision of the penal
                        code, the reform of prison discipline, the work of improving the port of
                        Lisbon, the reform of the military system, and finally the financial
                        condition of the country.</p>

                            bring it before the Cortes, and I hope it will receive your
                            approval.</p>
                        <p>After my visit to the adjoining Kingdom, accompanied by my beloved
                            consort, to thank their Catholic Majesties for the visit which in the
                            previous year they had made to Portugal, this day is the first
                            opportunity I have had to speak of this fact before the national
                            representatives, and I avail myself of the occasion to declare how
                            thankful I am for the unequivocal proofs of friendly feeling which I
                            received while there, not only from the sovereigns, but also from the
                            Spanish people, as shown to my person, to my family, and the Portuguese
                            nation. These proofs of reciprocal sympathy, while they attest the
                            mutual independence of the two countries, contribute to the
                            consolidation of the ties which unite them in the interests of their
                            business relations.</p>
                        <p>The demonstrations of which the queen was the object during her journey
                            call for equally sincere gratitude on my part.</p>
                        <p>Having in view the completion of my dear son’s education I directed that
                            he should visit various countries of Europe. During this journey now
                            terminated, the prince received in the various courts he visited such
                            cordial reception from their respective sovereigns that it calls for my
                            public acknowledgments. I also here record my most grateful memory of
                            the sympathy with which he was entertained by many private individuals
                            of different nations.</p>
                        <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0543"/>
                        <p>Public tranquillity has been maintained, and the renewal of the
                            administrative bodies throughout the Kingdom was effected with
                            order.</p>
                        <p>There remained undiscussed at the close of the last session of the Cortes
                            various projects of law, the most important of these being the reform of
                            the charter and the electoral law. Above all others I call your
                            attention to these, that measures of such importance may be sanctioned
                            by the Parliament with that emphasis which the patriotism of all may
                            give them.</p>
                        <p>Employing the power granted, my Government lately contracted a loan to
                            meet the extraordinary expenses of the state. My minister of finance
                            will give you an account of this transaction and the conditions under
                            which it was made.</p>
                        <p>During the last recess concessions were made by public competition for
                            the construction of the Beira Baixa, of the Foz Tua to Mirandella, and
                            of the branch to Vizeu, railways. The concession for the termination of
                            the railway system of the south and southwest was not granted, although
                            it was offered for public competition; accordingly the work on these
                            lines has been undertaken by the state. The Government will lay before
                            the Cortes the acts to which I refer, some of which require legislative
                            sanction. My Government has also concluded with the Royal Company of
                            Portuguese Railways the final contract for the construction of the
                            railroad from Torres Vedras to Alfarellos and Figueira. An agreement has
                            been come to between that company and the Beira Alta Company—which has
                            received the approval of the Government—by which the branch to Coimbra
                            will be undertaken by the former company; the latter withdrawing its
                            claim to the construction of the branch to Alfarellos.</p>
                        <p>Of various other measures made public by the different ministries
                            employing administrative authority, an account will be given you in due
                            time. The concession for the construction of the new port at Leixões was
                            offered for public competition in conformity with the terms of the
                            law.</p>
                        <p>In virtue of power granted by Article 15 of the additional act of the
                            charter, various measures of a legislative character were adopted during
                            the recess. The most important referred to the building of a railroad
                            from Lourenco Marques to the frontier of the Transvaal. All of these
                            measures were submitted to the Cortes on one of the last days of the
                            recent session.</p>
                        <p>Some proposals with reference to subjects of public administration will
                            be presented to you by my ministers, and I mention among them the
                            revision of the penal code, the additional enactments indispensable to
                            perfect the penitentiary system, the improvement of the port of Lisbon,
                            and army reform. With these and all others pending, you are sure to
                            occupy yourselves with your accustomed devotion.</p>
                        <p>The finances as ever demand the serious attention of the public
                            authorities, and within the prescribed time there will be presented to
                            you by the respective ministers the budget of receipts and expenditures,
                            as well as various projects of law intended to improve the financial
                            condition of the country. The maintenance of credit denotes the
                            confidence which capital feels in the resources of the nation. With the
                            diminution of certain taxes, which by this measure will become more
                            productive, and by some other measures to be presented to you, with a
                            scrupulous and well-considered economy, my Government is confident that
                            it may establish equality, between the ordinary receipts and
                            expenditures.</p>
                        <p>The subjects to which I have invited your attention, and which are
                            subject to your disposal during the present session, are the most
                            serious that can be considered by a parliament. However, they are not
                            superior to your wisdom and to your devotion.</p>
                        <p>The confidence with which you inspire me is at least equal to the serious
                            task you have to discharge.</p>
                        <p>With this confidence, and convinced of your patriotism, and trusting in
                            Divine Providence, we shall co-operate in preparing the measures
                            intended to secure the continuance of peace and the future development
                            of the country. I declare the session opened.</p>

                    <p>A statement of the expenditures as estimated in detail, together with the
                        most important items of anticipated revenue accompanies this dispatch. The

                        taxation in this Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>From a report laid before the Cortes by the minister of finance on the 16th
                        February ultimo it appears that the ordinary and extraordinary expenses of
                        the Kingdom during the year 1883–’84 exceeded the estimates by the sum of
                        1,716,000 ($1,853.28 millreis), while the revenue was $259,200 less.</p>
                    <p>It appears from an official statement recently made to the Cortes by the
                        minister of finance that the funded debt of this Kingdom was as follows:</p>

                    <p>During the last decade the increase of the public debt of this Kingdom has
                        been fully $180,000,000. It should be stated in extenuation, however, that
                        railroad and other important public improvements completed by the Government
                        within the period named represent a larger sum than this augmented public
                        indebtedness.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding the annual deficits in the budgets of the Kingdom and the
                        steady increase of the public indebtedness—now quite as large, per capita,
                        as is that of Great Britain—it is a fact that the public credit of Portugal
                        is quite steadily sustained. Its 3 per cent, securities at the ruling rates
                        stand about 52, showing an interest of considerably less <pb n="445"
                            xml:id="pg_445" facs="0545"/>than 6 per cent, which the Government has
                        to pay upon its loans, the latter, however, bringing to the treasury little
                        more than 50 per cent, of the amount of debt incurred.</p>
                    <p>It is conceded by prudent statesmen and thoughtful business men here that the
                        debt of Portugal is now quite as heavy as can be borne by this people and
                        that any material increase of the burden would involve grave peril to the
                        public credit—already sufficiently strained—and to the business interests of
                        the country.</p>
                    <p>The minister of finance makes a recommendation to the Cortes that the tax on
                        salt consumed in the Kingdom be reduced from 8 to 3 reis a litre, and that
                        the tax on imported alcohol be reduced from $2.16 a decalitre (2 1/5
                        gallons) to $1.29.</p>
                    <p>An export duty of 1 per cent. is now imposed upon gold and silver coin. A
                        proposition to suspend this duty at the discretion of the Government has
                        been unanimously accepted in the House of Deputies, and will no doubt be
                        enacted into law.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The question of the revision of the
                        constitution of Portugal has been the subject of great interest and earnest
                        discussion among publicists and in the national legislature for many months
                        past. The reforms contemplated by such revision and accompanying laws
                        proposed by the <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0548"/>ministry were quite
                        fully set forth in my No. 40 of March 13, 1883. Early in the present session
                        of the Cortes the House of Deputies voted by a large majority in favor of
                        the initiatory measure for the adoption of the governmental reforms. After
                        six weeks of debate in the House of Peers it received the final sanction of
                        that body on the 22d instant by a vote of 69 yeas to 14 nays. The reforms
                        embrace primarily the reconstruction of the House of Peers. This is the
                        constitutional feature. At present there is no limitation to the number of
                        peers. They are appointed by the King. They have already attained to one
                        hundred and forty in number. The pressure for appointment to the peerage has
                        been a source of embarrassment to His Majesty. Besides, His Majesty felt
                        that questions of much importance to the state and eliciting great popular
                        interest, and sometimes passion, might lead, in case of a vital disagreement
                        between the two houses—the peers opposing and defeating the measures of the
                        popular branch of the national legislature—to the suggestion involving not a
                        little danger to the throne, of a kingly peerage baffling the popular will
                        and so encroaching upon the liberties of the people. To remove this danger,
                        to relieve His Majesty of embarrassing responsibility, and so afford greater
                        security to the throne, while conceding larger scope to the popular will,
                        the amendment of the constitution was proposed by the ministry whereby the
                        number of peers would be limited, two-thirds to be appointed by the King and
                        one-third to be elected by the people, the hereditary principle to be
                        abolished. This is certainly an advance forward in the policy of
                        liberalization. The legislative reforms relate to the conditions of
                        suffrage, whereby all male subjects (except for disabilities of crime or
                        non-residence), who have arrived at the age of twenty-one years and have an
                        income equivalent to 100 millreis a year shall be entitled to the franchise
                        privilege; minority representation to a limited extent is assured, and other
                        provisions are made to place the elections upon, an improved basis.</p>
                    <p>Under the action of the Cortes an election will take place at a time to be
                        appointed by the Government, not later than August, when members of the
                        house of deputies will be elected specially upon the issue of the reforms.
                        As early as September the new Cortes will assemble and pass upon the details
                        of the measures which will thereafter go into effect. This work must all be
                        accomplished before the body meets in regular session, January 2, 1885.</p>
                    <p>So far the fact is established that the reforms are to be effected unless the
                        Government is defeated at the forthcoming special election—an improbable
                        event. It only remains for the new Cortes to settle details, which will
                        doubtless be done substantially as the Government desires.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The ocean cable telegraph project between “the
                        mainland of Portugal and the Azores, and from thence to America, Great
                        Britain, and Ireland, France, and Spain,” which has been the object of
                        numerous concessions during the past fifteen years, to seven different
                        companies <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0549"/>who have successively
                        failed to take even the preliminary steps toward the realization of the
                        measure, seems now about to be carried out by “The American, British, and
                        Continental Gable Company, Limited.”</p>
                    <p>By Article 2 of the concession a monopoly is granted the company in the
                        following terms: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The Government concedes to this concessionaire the exclusive right
                                for twenty years to lay submarine cables from Portugal to the
                                Azorean Islands, and such as may connect these islands with Great
                                Britain and Ireland, France, Spain, and any country mentioned in
                                Article 4.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>Article 4 reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The cable from Portugal to America may consist of five or six
                                sections, as follows: First, from Portugal to any one of the Azorean
                                Islands, at the choice of the company; second, from thence to
                                Bermuda; third, from Bermuda to the Bahama Islands; fourth, from
                                Bermuda to the United States of America of the North; fifth, from
                                the Bahamas to the Island of Cuba.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The monopoly thus granted is in violation of the principle that the
                        Government of the United States should not permit the landing of an ocean
                        cable on its shores; the concession for which involves a monopoly. It is
                        with reference to this principle that the attention of the Department is
                        called to this enterprise.</p>
                    <p>It is stipulated by the terms of the concession that the cable from the
                        Island of St. Michael’s, Azores, to Lisbon, “or to the mouth of the river
                        Minpo,” shall be ready for use by the month of September next, while that
                        “connecting the Islands of Flores and Fayal with Falmouth and America” is to
                        be completed by the month of March, 1885. The project further involves a
                        system of cables between the more important islands of the Azorean
                        archipelago, as well as the establishment of land lines in such of the
                        islands as seem to require them.</p>
                    <p>Article 8 stipulates that the cable shall be opened for traffic between the
                        Island of St. Michael’s and “one of the American States” within eighteen
                        months after date of the concession.</p>
                    <p>The company has made a deposit with the Portuguese Government of £3,600 as a
                        guarantee for the completion of its work as above set forth. The capital of
                        the company, as stated in its prospectus, is 6,750 contos ($7,290,000).</p>
                    <p>The promoters of the enterprise express the fullest confidence of their
                        ability to assure its success, doubtful as it is regarded by many as
                        respects any promise of pecuniary profits.</p>

                        gold loan of £15,000,000 has exceeded public expectation, and testifies to
                        the recovery of Russian credit. Two-thirds of this sum was negotiated
                        through the house of <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0550"/>Bleichröder,
                        of Berlin, a protégé of Prince Bismarck, fast rising into prominence in the
                        financial world, and the Preussisehe Seehandlung, one of the oldest and
                        soundest corporations in Germany, which has never before been permitted to
                        openly participate in or morally support a foreign loan; That this institute
                        was authorized to subscribe for most of the amount of the loan allotted to
                        Berlin has been much remarked, for as it is practically a branch of the
                        ministry of finance, its aid to Russia is of great significance, and goes
                        far to prove the cordiality of the relations now existing between the two
                        Empires.</p>
                    <p>The loan has been covered more than fifteen times, principally in Germany and
                        Holland. France took but a small sum, and England, it appears, none at all.
                        For Russia itself the remaining third was reserved and eagerly sought. In
                        fact, it has not given satisfaction to every one here that this loan was
                        mostly contracted abroad, by which the already heavy drain of gold from the
                        imperial treasury for the payment of interest upon foreign debts is
                        increased, and the promptness with which her own people subscribed to the
                        loan raised at home last December indicated that Russia need not have had
                        recourse to foreign bankers.</p>
                    <p>The avowed object of the new loan is to build railways, especially in
                        Siberia; but it is stated that not much money from abroad will be available
                        for this purpose, as most of it will have to be taken for the payment of
                        interest upon former foreign loans, for which Russia has at this moment no
                        other funds at its disposition. Nevertheless, the favor with which this loan
                        has been received abroad by bona fide investors has revived confidence in
                        Russian finance, and exchange has risen 4 or 5 per cent, in less than the
                        same number of weeks.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: A few months ago the Government of Russia
                        issued an order requiring the railway companies of the country to give
                        notice to all employés of foreign nationality to become Russian subjects or
                        leave their service. Similar regulations have been made in other countries;
                        the hardship of it in Russia is that many foreign employés, near the
                        expiration of the term at which they are entitled to pension, by now leaving
                        the service lose the right to claim their pension.</p>
                    <p>The order was at once enforced, and led to much complaint on the part of
                        those unwilling to conform to it. The German and British ambassadors, who
                        have many thousands of compatriots engaged on the Russian railways, have
                        been powerless to unofficially effect any mitigation of the measure, though
                        in some individual cases they have obtained exceptional favors; and they
                        admit that as it is purely of internal regulation, their intervention on
                        behalf of the sufferers cannot properly be claimed. Only two complaints thus
                        far have been made to this legation; <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0551"
                        />not so much in remonstrance against the order itself as to inquire
                        regarding the penalty of thus losing American nationality and the right to
                        regain it at a later day. * * *</p>
                    <p>I have declined to give” advice; I have limited myself to the expression of
                        my belief that there is no law which hinders resumption of citizenship 5
                        that in all probability an American by birth, naturalized as a foreign
                        subject, would, on declaration of intent to become an American citizen
                        again, be treated as an alien, and as such be able to be naturalized; that
                        perhaps greater facilities—fewer formalities—would be met with than in the
                        case of a foreigner wishing to become an American citizen, but that I could
                        find no statute bearing upon the subject.</p>
                    <p>It is now at the request of one of these complainants that I take the liberty
                        to refer the question to you for an expression of opinion.</p>

                        from Chantabun, an important Siamese port, on the eastern shore of the Gulf
                        of Siam, about 170 miles southeast of Bangkok, whither I had gone to make
                        survey of the trade prospects.</p>
                    <p>The town has a sheltered harbor for junks and light-draught vessels only, and
                        an estimated population of 30,000 Chinese, Anamen, and Siamese. It sells
                        annually for foreign consumption about 25,000 piculs of pepper (a picul
                        equals 133⅓ pounds).</p>
                    <p>Precious stones, cardamom seeds, and ivory in small quantities are also
                        exported. On the hill sides near by, coffee is produced.</p>
                    <p>In the alluvial plains, 20 miles out, stretching as many miles more toward
                        Batamboug, and in a northeasterly course, sapphires are found. The workers
                        in these deposits are now few in number, and are for the most part
                        experienced Indian and Burmese miners.</p>
                    <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0553"/>
                    <p>The gems are said to be not inferior in beauty, brilliancy, and value to the
                        sapphires of Ceylon.</p>
                    <p>I found a Roman Catholic mission, claiming 2,000 converts, engaged in what
                        appeared to be a not unsuccessful work.</p>
                    <p>French influences are seeking to establish a line of steamships from Bangkok,
                        via Chantabun, to Saigon, the capital of French Cochin China, and give
                        assurance of ultimate success.</p>
                    <p>The special inducements for American trade are not now superior to what may

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sire</hi>: The Reverend Doctor McGilvary and his
                            associates of the Presbyterian mission at Cheng Mai, desire permission
                            to establish a missionary station at Lakon, in the North Laos country;
                            to reside there permanently as teachers of the Christian religion; to
                            have protection and safe conduct at the station, and in transit to and
                            from the same; to buy houses and grounds for the necessary buildings; to

                            gratuitously with medicine and medical attendance; and to the end that
                            they may be aided, assisted, and protected herein, request, through me,
                            a royal letter of authority directed to the viceroy at Lakon.</p>
                        <p>In a late proclamation it was announced “that it is His Majesty’s
                            pleasure that all his subjects be allowed to choose their mode and
                            object of worship according to the dictates of their own consciences,”
                            and on a more recent occasion, when I had the honor of presenting, at a
                            royal audience, American men and women engaged in Christian missionary
                            work in Siam, your Majesty was understood to declare for “free
                            toleration in all religions that tended to the advancement of the people
                            and did not conflict with the laws of the realm.”</p>
                        <p>Upon these liberal and enlightened promises my constituents rely,

                            with the laws of the Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The petitioners are not political agents or Jacobins, but peaceable,
                            law-abiding persons desirous of doing good, who at all times and places
                            would be loyal to your Majesty’s Government, and to the constituted
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>I have pleasure in commending them, and in making their request my

                        which was not prolonged, on account of the information there communicated

                    <p>The reply was the petition had been considered, and that the Siamese
                        commissioner at Lakon would be instructed to obtain from the authorities at
                        Lakon the desired protection, and that I should be furnished with a copy of

                        October 9 last, to you, I have now to state that the Siamese consul at New
                        York recently announced to the Department the departure from Liverpool, the
                        26th instant, of the special embassy from Siam for the United States,
                        whither it was expected to arrive about the 2d or 3d proximo.</p>
                    <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0555"/>
                    <p>These facts were duly communicated to the President, who properly presented
                        them to Congress. * * * The Secretary of the Treasury has directed the
                        customs authorities to extend to the embassy, upon its arrival at New York,
                        every facility and courtesy for the passage of the personal baggage of His
                        Majesty’s special mission, and has placed at its disposal a revenue-cutter
                        to convey the embassy to that city upon the arrival of the ship at
                        quarantine.</p>
                    <p>The Secretaries of War and of the Navy have also been requested to lend the
                        co-operation of their respective Departments, to the extent at least of
                        firing a salute upon the arrival of the ship off New York, and to otherwise
                        testify their lively interest in the approaching embassy. Rear-Admiral
                        Rodgers, U. S. N., who will be accompanied by Mr. Sevellon A. Brown, chief
                        clerk of this Department, has been designated to proceed to New York, and on
                        the arrival of the embassy to extend to it, in the name of the President of
                        the United States, a cordial and sincere welcome. From the foregoing, it
                        will be perceived that every precaution has been taken to demonstrate to the
                        embassy the pleasure which this Government feels at receiving it, and I may
                        also observe that the desire of the President is that no opportunity shall
                        be omitted whereby be may further testify his high appreciation of the
                        presence of this representative body from that distant friendly country,
                        Siam.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department’s instruction No. 45, of April
                        29 last, will have apprised you of its action in respect of the expected
                        special mission from Siam. Since then, the mission has reached our shores in
                        safety, and the preparations outlined in the Department’s previous
                        instruction for the reception of the Siamese were fully observed.</p>
                    <p>I may now, in continuation of that subject, briefly refer to what has been
                        done for the pleasure of the mission, since its arrival in the United States
                        up to the present time.</p>
                    <p>As stated in the Department’s No. 45, Rear-Admiral Rodgers, whom the
                        President designated to receive the mission in his name, met it on the
                        arrival of the ship and discharged the service intrusted to him with care
                        and fidelity.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of the Treasury kindly placed at the disposition of
                        Rear-Admiral Rodgers a revenue-cutter belonging to this Government. In this
                        boat, he met the ship and conveyed the mission to New York. In that city,
                        the mission remained during Sunday (the day of its arrival) and Monday, May
                        3 and 4, at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, as the guest of this nation, reaching
                        this capital on Tuesday following, where they were similarly cared for at
                        the Arlington Hotel, for about ten days.</p>
                    <p>Immediately upon their arrival at Washington, the members of the mission were
                        formally presented by me to the President, who expressed <pb n="456"
                            xml:id="pg_456" facs="0556"/>great pleasure at receiving them and warm
                        personal sympathy for their country, between which and the United States the
                        most amicable relations have always existed.</p>
                    <p>Every possible attention was shown the mission during its stay here,
                        including a trip to Mount vernon, on the United States steamer Despatch, in
                        order to manifest our lively interest in the welfare of its members
                        personally and our warmest sympathies for their country. Not only has the
                        mission been the subject of these official attentions, but many courtesies
                        have also been accorded by private citizens. These latter I have no doubt
                        have been much appreciated and contributed in no small degree to the
                        pleasure and comfort of the individual members.</p>
                    <p>The mission has lately returned to New York, whose citizens have also
                        manifested great appreciation for it. It is understood that the mission will
                        leave that city early next week on a westward tour, which may extend as far
                        as the Pacific coast.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Isaac T. Smith, the consul of Siam at New York, and whose efforts and
                        services have been constantly exerted for the welfare of His Majesty’s
                        subjects since their arrival in the United States, has informed the
                        Department that the mission intended visiting Philadelphia Monday next.</p>
                    <p>I at once addressed the mayor upon the subject, asking that an officer of the
                        city government meet, if possible, the mission and escort it to the various
                        places of interest, as but one day’s time was available. The superintendent
                        of the United States Mint was also addressed and requested to extend to the
                        mission upon its arrival every possible opportunity for examining whatever
                        might prove of interest.</p>
                    <p>I apprehend that these precautions will be all that is necessary to render
                        their trip to Philadelphia one of success and pleasure.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: This port is Russia’s principal military and
                        naval station on the Pacific. It has a population of 10,000 and a prospect
                        of healthy growth. It is connected with Nagasaki, Japan, 800 miles distant,
                        via the Corean ports Fusan and Yuen-San, by monthly steam service. During
                        four months of the year navigation is suspended by the rigors of winter. On
                        the west it has uninterrupted connection with St. Petersburg by post-route
                        and telegraph.</p>
                    <p>The situation is pleasing, and the harbor safe and capacious. It would seem
                        easy of defense.</p>
                    <p>An iron floating dry-dock, with capacity for the largest vessels, is under
                        contract and will soon be completed.</p>
                    <p>On the adjacent lands cereals and vegetables thrive. It is not at all
                        improbable that Siberia may yet supply Asia with bread.</p>
                    <p>Large well-stocked mercantile establishments and godowns may be <pb n="457"
                            xml:id="pg_457" facs="0557"/>seen, owned or controlled by Germans who
                        buy in Hamburg and ship direct by steamer through the Suez Canal.</p>
                    <p>Here, as elsewhere in the East, Chinamen are the workers, the day laborers,
                        brick-makers, butchers, bakers, shopkeepers, &amp;c. A few Coreans are
                        employed in the brick-yards. Russians, Siberians, and Cossacks are the
                        soldiers, sailors, and drosky drivers.</p>
                    <p>Meat is the staple article of food. Good beef is abundant. People of all
                        conditions affect <hi rend="italic">caviar</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >vodka</hi>. Ladies smoke cigarettes at the dinner table, and dress with
                        the elegance of their sisters in Washington or Paris.</p>
                    <p>Though the trees are in leaf, and the hillsides are carpeted with green, the
                        mercury marks 40° Fahrenheit, while men and women wear winter clothing,
                        wraps, and furs. Later in the season 80° of heat may be reached.</p>
                    <p>The Western powers are not represented by consuls; Japan alone having a
                        commercial agent. I was told that such representation was not desired,
                        inasmuch as this is a Government station, and not an open free port
                        soliciting trade with the outside world. No one may venture hither without a
                        passport; a strict surveillance is maintained. The Corean frontier is 80
                        miles distant on the south. Saghalien, an island ceded by Japan, containing
                        the Russian convict settlements, is hard by.</p>
                    <p>I have exchanged calls with the governor. At one of our interviews I took
                        occasion to observe that the considerate treatment awarded to the heroes,
                        lost and living, of the ill-fated Jeannette, by himself and other Russian
                        officials had made more enduring the warm friendship entertained by my
                        Government and people for his own. On account of ill health I have been
                        compelled to decline proffered courtesies.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">En route</hi> to Vladivostock I visited Fusan and Yuensan
                        (Gensan) on the east coast of Corea. From what I saw and learned of the
                        hermit kingdom” I could hardly recommend Americans to quit their own country

                            countrymen have been, and still are, bestowing upon me on all sides.</p>
                        <p>I never doubted receiving a warm and kindly welcome here, but that your
                            Government should have extended its hand toward me in the manner it has
                            done, arid that its members, one and all, should have spared no pains to
                            make my sojourn here delightful, is more than I could ever have expected
                            or than I can, even now, realize.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances you will not, I am sure, doubt how thoroughly
                            sincere my feelings are, nor will you allow me to forego the pleasure I
                            feel in expressing to you personally my sentiments of friendship and of
                            gratitude, for, although you are far away, I am fully sensible of the

                        <p>His Majesty, being acquainted with all the facts is of opinion that the
                            Rajah of Tuluban’s action in assisting American sailors is very

                            Pearson, of Boston, two boxes containing a Malay kris and two Malay

                            of the United States.</p>
                        <p>These rare weapons are of beautiful design and exquisite workmanship.
                            They will be valued, I doubt not, because of the sentiment which
                            inspired their presentation, as also because of the poetic interest
                            which attaches to the ruler, people, and land whence they come.</p>
                        <p>It will be remembered that in April, 1883, I had the honor of presenting
                            to this Malay chief, at his palace in Tuluban, in the name of my

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: His Majesty the King of Siam, in consideration
                        of the American Government’s warm friendship, and of your representative’s
                        “faithful observance of treaty relations,” has been pleased to present to
                        the United States the house, out-buildings, and lease-hold estate in grounds
                        now occupied by this legation.</p>
                    <p>Particulars are set forth in accompanying copy of dispatch this day received
                        from His Royal Highness Prince Devawongsa, His Majesty’s secretary.</p>
                    <p>I have communicated to His Majesty my grateful acknowledgments and high
                        appreciation of the sentiment that inspired the gift, and my purpose to
                        report same, without delay, to the President and Secretary of State of the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>The house is now occupied by the undersigned and is the same upon which I had
                        obtained a lease for sixteen years. I have assigned that contract of lease
                        without consideration or expense to my Government.</p>
                    <p>The improvements upon the compound have cost probably $10,000 or more. The
                        main building, 84 by 58 feet, is of wood, brick, and cement, two stories
                        high, with attap roof, fifteen rooms, and wide verandahs. It will be noted
                        that a ground rent of $84 annually is expected to be paid.</p>
                    <p>The property is advantageously situated between the British agency and
                        consulate-general and the Siamese customs house, in the midst of the
                        business part of the city of Bangkok, with a river frontage of 166 feet,
                        extending back 149 feet.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>I beg to express the great personal satisfaction I have in making this
                        communication.</p>

                        application in behalf of the American Presbyterian Church to establish a
                        mission at Lakon.</p>

                    <p>For answer, I received originals of drafts herewith, numbered 2 and 3. They
                        may or may not mean protection in the future.</p>
                    <p>It will be observed that, ostensibly, the power to act has been delegated to
                        Prince Bijet, the Siamese commissioner to the Laos states, and further, that
                        if a royal edict as promised has been issued it does not appear herein.</p>

                            this opportunity on which I have the high honor of presenting my letters
                            of credence as minister for Siam to the Government of the United States,
                            to express to your excellency the earnest wishes of my august sovereign
                            for the health and prosperity of your Excellency, and to assure you of
                            the constant desire of the King of Siam to maintain and strengthen the
                            friendly relations already existing between the two countries, relations
                            upon which so much of the happiness and prosperity of my country and the
                            growth of commercial interests between the two countries depend.</p>
                        <p>Since the year 1833, when the first treaty was made between the two
                            countries, my Government has always been conscious of the constant and
                            ever-increasing good will shown toward Siam by the United States, and
                            American citizens have always been regarded by Siam with feelings <pb
                                n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0565"/>of friendship and esteem,
                            particularly so the American missionaries, who, by their labors, have
                            done so much towards the advancement of education, science, and art in
                            my country.</p>
                        <p>Siam has been honored from time to time by visits from distinguished
                            American officers and citizens, and particularly so by the recent visit
                            of General Grant, which in itself, although unofficial, has been
                            regarded as a signal proof of friendship.</p>
                        <p>The appointment by the United States Government of General Halderman as
                            resident minister at Bangkok, being the first minister to reside near my
                            sovereign, has given so much pleasure and satisfaction to my Government
                            that it is by way of reciprocating this act of friendship that I have
                            now the honor to fill the appointment of Siamese minister to this
                            Republic; and in this capacity I humbly beg to assure your Excellency
                            that my chief object will be to study closely His Majesty’s wishes, in
                            the hope that opportunity may be afforded to me to give many proofs of
                            the good will of my sovereign toward this country.</p>
                        <p>For the reception so graciously accorded to me on my arrival by the
                            representatives of your Excellency, and for the sincere kindness
                            extended to me upon all sides, I beg, in behalf of His Majesty, to
                            tender to your Excellency his most sincere and cordial thanks.</p>

                        <p>The intercourse maintained between the United States and Siam for years
                            past has shown the mutual desire of the two countries to draw closer the
                            ties of friendship and commerce which join two nations separated by half
                            the circuit of the globe. Wide apart as they are, and different as are
                            their Governments and the lives of their peoples, I am glad to believe
                            that the two countries are very near together in their aspirations,
                            since both strive to put in practice like ideas of progress, and to
                            conduct Government for the benefit of the governed.</p>
                        <p>It is pleasant to know that your purpose now is to become acquainted with
                            this country, to visit its length and breadth, to observe its natural
                            resources and its tireless activity in the fields of invention, of
                            industry, of manufacture, and of the useful arts. Probably no country in
                            the world presents better examples for the study of the causes of
                            national development and success than our own, which, young as it is,
                            self-made and self-contained, seeks to work out its own aims with peace
                            and good will toward all its neighbors.</p>
                        <p>I beg of you to assure your sovereign of the friendship which we of the
                            United States bear to him and to the people over whom he is called to

                        source of discussion in and out of the Cortes, has attracted increased
                        attention during the past week on account of the public meeting of the
                        Spanish Abolition Society. The law of the 13th of February, 1880,
                        established a kind of guardianship over the slaves, who were accorded
                        certain rights and privileges in which they were to be guaranteed by the
                        intervention of “juntas “in the various districts of the island. My
                        predecessor, Mr. Lowell, in transmitting a copy of that law (No. 216,
                        November 11, 1879,) termed it an “attempt to cross slavery with freedom,
                        being in its very nature futile,” and he reported that “nobody expects that
                        the system of guardianship will work, or that slaves can be kept half
                        emancipated.”</p>
                    <p>The object of the meeting referred to was to expose the evil workings of the
                        law of 1880, and to demand the immediate and complete emancipation of the
                        slaves. It is insisted by this society that the influence of the masters
                        exercised on the local “juntas” and in the departments of the Madrid
                        Government has been sufficient in many instances to nullify the most
                        important provisions of the law. It states that the district “juntas” are in
                        most part composed of masters or advocates of slavery, and hence are always
                        disposed to favor the <hi rend="italic">patrons</hi>” or masters; and that
                        the circulars which the ministry of ultramar has sent to the island
                        enjoining, in the most explicit manner, the observance of the rights of the
                        negroes specified in the law of 1880, have been repeatedly disobeyed or
                        ignored. By that law all corporal punishment was prohibited, but
                        notwithstanding this positive provision the use of stocks and the ball and
                        chain in the most cruel manner has been notorious. Separation of families is
                        also prohibited, but this has been openly disregarded. For the failure of
                        the masters to comply with certain specified provisions adopted for the
                        protection and benefit of the slaves, the law decrees their immediate and
                        unconditional freedom; but this society estimates that there are now seventy
                        thousand negroes entitled to their freedom, who are held in bondage through
                        the failure or refusal of the “juntas” to give effect to the law. As
                        illustrations it cites the fact that under the law a slave who desires
                        emancipation may be appraised, and upon payment of the amount fixed he is to
                        become free; but there are instances where the “juntas” have refused to
                        recognize the payment in Mexican silver (which is the current coin in
                        commerce) and have required <hi rend="italic">gold of the old Spanish
                            coinage</hi> (not in circulation), and thereby defeated the law. In
                        other instances the “juntas” have refused to consider the petitions of the
                        slaves because they have not been presented on official paper or have not
                        selected as their representative a person approved by the “junta”; and when
                        no such technical objection can be interposed, in many cases the negroes are
                        deprived of their freedom or rights guaranteed by the law by the mere
                        inaction of the “juntas,” allowing their petitions to remain unattended to
                        for months or years. Another provision repeatedly violated by masters
                        without relief from the “juntas” <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0567"/>is
                        the payment of the monthly stipend to the slaves. A further injustice is
                        cited in the frequent denial or failure of the “juntas” to grant an appeal
                        from their decisions, provided for in the law.</p>
                    <p>Up to the present it is claimed the official influence in Cuba has almost
                        entirely been on the side of the “<hi rend="italic">patrons</hi>” and
                        against the negroes; but the society recognizes the indication of a better
                        spirit in the new governor-general of the island, and in its recent meeting
                        a note of thanks was tendered to the present ministry, and especially to the
                        president of the cabinet and the minister of ultramar, for the adoption of
                        the royal decree of the 27th November last, abolishing punishment by stocks
                        and the ball and chain. But it is insisted that the only remedy for the
                        injustice being inflicted upon the negroes and the evils suffered by the
                        island through slavery is its immediate and unconditional abolition; that
                        any political or economic reform is absolutely impossible in Cuba without
                        first destroying slavery, “the center of all abominations, the foundation of
                        all opposition, the cause of all antagonisms, the fountain of all
                        immorality, the supposed source of all disasters.”</p>
                    <p>A considerable number of the Cuban representatives in the Cortes are active
                        members of the Abolition Society, and as immediate emancipation has been one
                        of the measures proclaimed by the public men and party now in power, it is
                        designed to press the measure during the present session of the Cortes, with
                        a fair prospect of success.</p>
                    <p>Besides the interest which our country has in the general and moral aspects
                        of a question affecting so near a neighbor, for us additional interest
                        attaches to the measures which it is proposed by the advocates of immediate
                        emancipation to adopt, to compensate the owners tor the loss of their
                        slaves. It is conceded that neither the financial condition of Cuba or of
                        the mother country will admit of a money compensation. It is, therefore,
                        proposed to afford them relief in two ways: first, by removing all the
                        export tax on the products of the island; and second, by negotiating
                        treaties of commerce, especially a reciprocity convention with the United
                        States by which Cuban products will be afforded a more advantageous market,
                        and articles of prime necessity of living will be introduced free of duty or
                        at a lower tariff. The adoption of these measures it is claimed will so
                        greatly improve the interests of the planters as to abundantly compensate
                        them for the loss of slave-labor, which in its present condition has already
                        almost ceased to be valuable to them.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The consular agent at Port Mahon has presented
                        to the legation a question of citizenship, based upon the following
                        statement of facts:</p>
                    <p>Peter Lucas, a native of Spain, entered the United States military service in
                        1835, at the age of thirteen, and served over twenty-one years,
                        participating in the war with Mexico and that of the rebellion, and received
                        honorable mention for faithful and gallant conduct. He lived several years
                        in New York and was naturalized August 13, 1872. He has several sons
                        citizens of and now resident in the United States. He has re <pb n="468"
                            xml:id="pg_468" facs="0568"/>turned to Spain and has taken up his
                        residence at the place of his birth, Port Mahon. He has a minor son living
                        with him who was born in Spain before his naturalization as an American
                        citizen. This son has never been out of Spain, and hence was not in the
                        United States at the time of the father’s naturalization nor before or since
                        that event. I have no information that the father intends to résumé his
                        residence in the United States.</p>
                    <p>The son will next year reach the age when Spanish subjects are required to
                        render service in the army. Peter Lucas, the father, desires to know if this
                        minor son will be recognized by this legation as an American citizen and be
                        entitled to exemption from such service on account of his (the father’s)
                        American naturalization. I have deferred an answer until I shall have
                        referred the question to the Department, and I will thank you to give me the
                        proper instructions.</p>

                        State having in charge the subject, called to-day at the legation and
                        informed me that it had been decided to return the cattle tax collected by
                        the Spanish consul at Key West, Fla., on the exportation of cattle to Cuba,
                        which has been the subject of correspondence between this legation and the
                        Minister of State. He said that instructions were being prepared to be sent
                        to the consul at Key West on the subject, and that within a few days I would
                        be advised by an official note of the action of the Spanish Government.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my No. 129, of the 24th instant, I reported
                        to you the revocation of the fifth article of the royal decree of March 12,
                        1867, by which article merchandise proceeding from the United States under
                        the Spanish flag was required to pay the duties fixed in the fourth column
                        of the Cuban tariff. The Official Gazette of this morning contains the
                        decree <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0569"/>of revocation, a copy and
                        translation of which I inclose herewith. I do not advise you of this action
                        by cable, as the order does not begin to take effect until thirty days after
                        its publication by the Spanish consuls in their respective localities; and,
                        besides, I do not regard the measure as of such importance and satisfactory
                        character as to require it.</p>
                    <p>Having occasion to call upon the Minister of Ultramar yesterday on other
                        business, he referred to the revocation as an important concession to the
                        United States and as indicating the disposition of the present ministry to
                        satisfy the desires of our Government n regard to commercial relations with
                        Cuba.</p>
                    <p>I told the minister that it was undoubtedly a step in the right direction,
                        and I thanked him for bringing it about, but it was far from satisfying the
                        desires of the United States. While in a certain sense it was a concession
                        to American products, it was, more properly speaking, a favor to the Spanish
                        flag; but I doubted whether it would, in its practical operations, result in
                        any benefit to either our products or to Spanish vessels, as the latter
                        could hardly engage profitably in the trade carrying cargo only one way, and
                        at best it merely restored the condition of things as they existed before
                        1867, putting again in full rigor the objectionable differential flag
                        system, which had occasioned the discriminating 10 per cent, <hi
                            rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> duties in the United States.</p>
                    <p>The minister added that he hoped in time it would lead to other measures for
                        the improvement of trade relations between the United States and Cuba, a
                        subject to which his department was then giving a careful study.</p>
                    <p>On the publication of the decree of revocation to-day I asked of the Minister
                        of State an interview to learn more fully the views of his Government before
                        communicating to you the official copy of the decree, and I have just
                        returned from his ministry after an hour’s conference with him. I elaborated
                        somewhat at length my views expressed to the Minister of Ultramar, as above
                        briefly indicated, and told Señor Ruiz Gomez that the decree announced
                        to-day would fall far short of satisfying our Government. He answered that
                        the ministry considered it as an important concession to the United States,
                        and that he was sorry to see that I did not esteem it so highly; that it was
                        not claimed that this was all that was necessary to be done to place the
                        commercial relations of Cuba on a completely satisfactory basis, but it was
                        a great step in that direction; that he agreed with me that it was desirable
                        to abolish altogether the differential flag system, but that was a radical
                        reform which required careful examination, both in the interest of the Cuban
                        treasury and to secure ratification by the Cortes; that he had promised me
                        the subject should have special consideration, and in fulfillment of that
                        promise he had asked his colleague of Ultramar to send to him an official of
                        his department with whom he could discuss and agree upon the reforms which
                        were practicable; and he hoped in a short time to be able to submit
                        something definite for my examination. I thanked him for the repetition of
                        this assurance, but asked him to excuse me if I went beyond diplomatic
                        propriety when I said that I was becoming somewhat impatient under these
                        repeated assurances, and that it seemed to me the urgency of an early
                        arrangement of the Cuban commercial matters was not fully appreciated by his
                        Government; that more than two months had elapsed since he first discussed

                        commercial questions with Great Britain, Holland, Portugal, and Italy; that
                        if I had failed in the past to impress upon him the necessity of reaching
                        some agreement of our questions with Cuba, I desired <pb n="470"
                            xml:id="pg_470" facs="0570"/>to-day to inform him in the most positive
                        manner that these matters were approaching a crisis, as he might see from
                        the President’s last message to Congress. * * * I added that I thought he
                        was under a misapprehension in supposing that the adjustment of the
                        differential flag question was dependent upon the ratification of the
                        Cortes, as I understood that by the law of July 20, 1882, full power was
                        given to the Government to admit United States products at once to the
                        benefit of the third column of the Cuban tariff.</p>
                    <p>The minister * * * assured me that there was no intention on his part to give
                        preferential consideration to the questions of other Governments, and to
                        prove the sincerity of his desires he said he would call the Ministry of
                        Ultramar by telephone to ascertain if it was ready to take up the Cuban
                        commercial subjects immediately. * * *</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: My Nos. 131 and 132 and previous dispatches
                        have informed you of the steps taken and the progress made in my efforts to
                        induce the Spanish Government to bring about an improvement in the
                        commercial relations of Cuba and Porto Rico with the United States. I am
                        gratified to be able to announce that my efforts have been crowned with a
                        fair degree of success in the signing with the Spanish Minister of State, at
                        7 o’clock p.m. on yesterday, of the agreement which I have the honor to
                        transmit with this dispatch.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>Article 1 of this agreement admits the products of the United States
                            to the benefit of the third column of the tariffs of Cuba and Porto
                            Rico, being thereby exempted from the 30 to 60 per cent, extra duty of
                            the fourth column, under which they have heretofore been admitted. But
                            its greatest gain is in securing the abandonment by Spain, so far as the
                            United States is concerned, of the differential flag system, against
                            which our Government has so long remonstrated.</item>
                        <item>Article 2 restores the Cuban market to the Florida fishermen, whose
                            large and profitable trade was broken up by the Spanish order of March
                            13, 1882.</item>
                        <item>Article 3 settles, so far as relates to the Spanish West Indies, the
                            irritating question of Spanish consular tonnage fees on cargoes
                            collected in our ports. I, of course, understand that it would have been
                            better to have secured a full concession from Spain of the international
                            illegality of levying and collecting an export tax by foreign officials
                            in our own ports; but as in its application it was mainly a burden on
                            our West Indian commerce, and as the agreement related exclusively to
                            that commerce, I thought it wise to accept the concession in this
                            limited form. I regard it as a virtual yielding of the whole question,
                            and I have no doubt the practice will be entirely abandoned, as soon as
                            the necessary legislation can be had to supply the deficit in the
                            consular budget.</item>
                        <item>Article 4 provides for the removal of the extra duty of 10 per cent.
                                <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> on cargoes brought from the
                            Antilles under the Spanish flag, which our Government imposed in
                            retaliation of the Spanish differential flag duty. The latter being
                            abolished, the removal of the 10 per cent. duty follows as a
                            consequence.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>For the fuller information of the Department of the Treasury, articles 5 and
                        6 will be made the subject of a separate dispatch.</p>
                    <p>To enable both Governments to issue the proclamation and orders required by
                        the agreement, and to give ample notice to their respective officials and
                        shipping, article 7 provides that the stipulations of the agreement shall go
                        into effect on the 1st of March next.</p>
                    <p>Article 8, relating to negotiations for a treaty of commerce and navigation,
                        will also be made the subject of a separate dispatch.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The 5th article of the agreement for the
                        improvement of the commercial relations of the United States with Cuba and
                        Porto Rico, transmitted with my No. 134, of yesterday, provides for the
                        removal of all discriminating or extra duties in this commerce, and is
                        designed to cover any cases not specified in the preceding articles. During
                        the negotiations which led to the agreement, my attention was called to the
                        report of the Spanish consul at New Orleans, dated in 1876, in which he
                        states that not only is there imposed on the cargoes of Spanish vessels
                        arriving from Cuba and Porto Rico the extra 10 per cent, <hi rend="italic"
                            >ad valorem</hi> duty, but that the vessels when they bring cargo from
                        Cuba have to pay, in addition to the usual tonnage dues, an extra charge of
                        $1.62½ for each ton of measurement.</p>
                    <p>I have replied that I had no information in the Legation to show that any
                        such charge existed, and that I was satisfied no such discriminating tax was
                        now collected on Spanish vessels. It was agreed, however, that article 5
                        should be understood to cover the case cited by the Spanish consul at New
                        Orleans, as well as any other discriminating charges which might exist in
                        the ports of either the United States or the Spanish West Indies.</p>
                    <p>Article 6 of the agreement was framed to meet the difficulties arising from
                        the export tax in Cuba and Porto Rico. It is charged that frauds are
                        frequently perpetrated upon the Spanish treasury by exporters of sugar and
                        tobacco with the connivance of the custom-house officials of those islands
                        in the evasion of the payment of the export tax levied on these two
                        products. To enable the Spanish Government to have a check upon its own
                        officials, it has been agreed that, whenever so requested, the collectors of
                        customs of the ports of the United States will furnish to the respective
                        Spanish consuls certificates of the cargoes of sugar and tobacco brought in
                        vessels proceeding from both the Spanish Antilles. The Ministry for the
                        Colonies, in a memorandum which it has given me on the subject, expresses
                        its belief that the necessity on the part of the Spanish consuls to ask for
                        such certificates will very soon be obviated, “as its object is to verify
                        and correct the dishonesty on the part of the officials of the custom
                        houses, if it exists in Cuba, as some charge, and as soon as these officials
                        learn that the shipments of sugar and tobacco are compared on their arrival
                        they will cease to commit frauds on the revenue, if they practice them.”</p>
                    <p>I respectfully suggest that the contents of this dispatch be made known to
                        the Department of the Treasury for its information and action.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In transmitting the printed copy of the
                        agreement of the 2d instant, as published, with my No. 138, of the 7th
                        instant, I referred to the question which had arisen in the Ministry of
                        State as to whether the <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0573"/>third
                        article would not require the approbation of the Cortes before being carried
                        into effect. In a conversation which I had with the minister of state on the
                        9th instant, he informed me that it had been decided that as the consular
                        tonnage fees were prescribed by a law of the Cortes, it would require the
                        legislative authority to give validity to the stipulation of article 3. He
                        said he would, therefore, without delay, submit this clause of the agreement
                        to the Cortes for its approbation, and that he did not doubt that his
                        Government would be able to carry out the entire agreement on the date
                        specified. The other stipulations were fully embraced in the law of July 20,
                        1882 (see inclosure to Mr. Hamlin’s No. 74, of August 5, 1882), and would be
                        carried into execution without the action of the Cortes. In conformity with
                        the foregoing indication, on the 12th instant the Minister of State
                        submitted to the chamber of deputies the royal decree, of which I inclose a
                        copy and translation, reporting to that body the use which the Government
                        had made of article 3 of the law of July 20, 1882, and soliciting its
                        approbation of the abolition of consular tonnage fees contemplated in
                        article 3 of the agreement.</p>
                    <p>While I cannot doubt the good intentions of the Spanish Government in regard
                        to the exact execution of the agreement, in view of the fact that a change
                        of ministry within a few days is imminent, I deem it proper to suggest that
                        the issuance of the proclamation of the President for the suspension of the
                        extra 10 per cent, ad valorem duties may be postponed, until I shall be
                        advised of the time when the orders of the Spanish Government are to be
                        published, which, on its part, carry the agreement into effect, in order
                        that the respective publications may be as nearly concurrent as
                        possible.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I advised you in my No. 128, of the 22d
                        ultimo, of the informal notice I had received from the Ministry of State
                        that it had been decided to order the return of the cattle-tax exacted by
                        the Spanish consul at Key West. As the official notice did not come as
                        promised, after waiting two weeks in anticipation of the change of ministry,
                        I asked the subsecretary of state to have the matter dispatched if possible.
                        On the 19th instant, the day after the change of ministry, I received a
                        note, dated the 12th, signed by Señor Ruiz Gomez, of which a copy and
                        translation is inclosed, communicating the action, or rather the intention,
                        of the Spanish Government.</p>
                    <p>This note states that having asked information of the consul at Key West, and
                        it appearing that the tax on cattle was collected under a misapprehension,
                        on the 20th of May last it was ordered that the duty should be lowered to 10
                        cents per head, and that now the necessary orders will be sent that the
                        consul at Key West may proceed to rectify the sums which have been
                        wrongfully received, in order to return the same to the interested parties.
                        It adds that the modification of the tonnage-tax is a question for very
                        attentive and delicate study, requiring the approval of the Cortes, but that
                        the Government is examining the subject with a view to a project of
                        reform.</p>
                    <p>I also inclose a copy of my note of the 22d instant in reply. While I thank
                        the minister for the promised return of the illegally collected tax, I
                        express regret that the note did not contain an announcement of the
                        intention of the Spanish Government to abolish the tonnage-tax altogether,
                        and I thought it opportune to review briefly the position of our Government
                        on that question.</p>
                    <p>But in view of the concession which has been made in the third article of the
                        agreement of the 2d instant as to the tonnage dues in the West Indian trade,
                        I consider it best not to press too strongly the general question, until we
                        have secured that concession, which it seems will require the approbation of
                        the Cortes. When that is gained the total abolition will be more easy. I
                        have been the more confirmed in this view from an examination of the facts
                        attending the original establishment of this tonnage-tax. By reference to
                        Mr. Adee’s Nos. 329, 342, and 372, of October, 1876, it will be seen that
                        this tax was substituted for what is known as the “package”-tax, against
                        which our Government had earnestly remonstrated, and that Mr. Adee, in
                        transmitting the royal order of October 16, 1876, repealing the package-tax
                        and imposing the tonnage-tax in its present shape, called the attention of
                        the Department to the very points raised in the instructions of Secretary
                        Blaine to Minister Hamlin, and asked the instructions of the Department upon
                        them. I do not understand that the omission to give any instructions is to
                        be taken as an acquiescence at the time in the tonnage-tax, as it is to be
                        inferred that the Department considered the enforcement of the tax in
                        specific cases as affording the most opportune occasion to protest against
                        it.</p>

                            July and 18th October last, relative to the claims presented by Mr.
                            Mackay against the exaction of certain duties exacted by the consular
                            agents of Spain at Key West on the exportation of live stock to the
                            Island of Cuba, and insisting at the same time on the point of view
                            adopted by the Republic in respect to the exaction of these same duties
                            in the territory of the Union.</p>
                        <p>In reply I have the honor to inform your excellency that having
                            opportunely asked of the said consulate information as to the collection
                            of the 40 cents on each head of live stock, and it having been shown
                            that this exaction was unjustified and was founded on a misunderstanding
                            of one of the officials who had charge of the agency, this ministry
                            ordered on the 20th May last that the above-mentioned duty should be
                            lowered to the sum of 10 cents, which Has been collected since said
                            date; and now the necessary instructions will be sent that the consul at
                            Key West may proceed to verify the general liquidation of the sums which
                            have been wrongfully received, in order to return the same to the
                            interested party.</p>
                        <p>As to the modification of the tariff in respect to the tonnage duty on
                            the cargoes of vessels, I must repeat that it is a question for a very
                            attentive and delicate study, as it treats of a reform of a legislative
                            character, which can only be carried into effect with the consent of the
                            co-legislative body; and I limit myself, therefore, in assuring your
                            excellency that the Government is examining the general question of
                            consular duties with all care, in order to present within the shortest
                            possible time a general project of reform, which will embrace this
                            special question and some others claimed by the innovations which have
                            been introduced in commercial matters and exacted for the convenience of
                            the public service.</p>

                            predecessor did me the honor to address to me, under date of the 12th
                            instant, was received at this legation on the 19th instant, in which he
                            informs me that the necessary instructions will be sent to the consul at
                            Key West to return the cattle-tax wrongfully collected from citizens of
                            the United States, and that the subject of tonnage dues on cargoes of
                            vessels exacted by Spanish consuls in American ports is receiving
                            examination with a view to a general project of reform.</p>
                        <p>I beg to express to your excellency the great gratification which I have
                            experienced in receiving this new evidence of the spirit of justice
                            which animates the Government of His Catholic Majesty, and I will hasten
                            to communicate to Washington the resolution which has been taken to
                            order the return of the cattle-tax wrongfully exacted by the Spanish
                            consul at Key West.</p>
                        <p>While I thus manifest the pleasure which this information occasions, I am
                            constrained to express some feeling of regret that the note of the 12th
                            instant should not at the same time have contained the announcement of
                            the intention of the Spanish Government to abolish the tonnage dues
                            exacted by Spanish consuls in United States ports which gave rise to
                            this cattle-tax. But it appears that the resolution to return the
                            wrongful cattle-tax only extends to 30 cents of the 40 cents per head
                            collected, and that 10 cents per head is to be retained by the consul,
                            by virtue of the Spanish consular regulation which authorizes the
                            collection of 10 cents per ton on all cargoes of vessels sailing from
                            ports of the United States to Spanish ports. While the said note
                            announces a determination to examine the general subject with a view to
                            future modifications, it would seem that for the present the Spanish
                            Government was disposed to sanction the collection of a tax by its
                            consuls in the territory of the United States which had been expressly
                            prohibited by the Constitution of those States.</p>
                        <p>This question of tonnage dues exacted by Spanish consuls has been the
                            occasion of considerable correspondence between this legation and your
                            excellency’s predecessors, and I take the liberty of citing in this
                            connection the notes of the legation of January 7 and September 22,
                            1882, and of July 16 of the past year as containing the <pb n="476"
                                xml:id="pg_476" facs="0576"/>views of my Government thereon. In
                            these notes it is shown that the tax collected by the consuls is not a
                            specific fee for a specific service performed by the Spanish official,
                            but that it is a pro rata tax on the cargo of the vessel, and is to all
                            intents and purposes an export tax levied and collected by Spanish
                            consuls in the ports of the United States; that as such my Government,
                            as long ago as January 7, 1882, protested against it as objectionable,
                            offensive, and inadmissible, and qualified it as a system which has for
                            its object the collection of revenue in the ports of a foreign
                            government; and it further gave notice that, if persisted in, it might
                            become necessary to levy a similar duty in the United States on Spanish
                            products shipped from the ports of Spain and its colonies to the United
                            States. I need hardly repeat the conviction expressed in the note of my
                            predecessor of January 7, 1882, entertained by my Government, that Spain
                            does not intend or desire to put obstacles in the way Of free commercial
                            relations between the two countries, and that your excellency’s
                            Government does not propose to arrogate to itself the right to levy an
                            export duty in the ports of foreign and friendly nations; but such is
                            the real effect of the Spanish consular tonnage dues; and when I add
                            that the people of my country are so hostile to all kinds of export
                            taxes that from the foundation of the Government to the present day the
                            National Constitution has contained a prohibition against the levy of
                            all export taxes, your excellency will understand how impossible it is
                            that my Government should acquiesce in the collection of the tonnage
                            dues referred to, nor can I believe that when the full gravity of the
                            question is understood by your excellency, you will allow the consuls of
                            Spain in the United States to continue to violate the express provision
                            of the National Constitution and disregard the solemn protests of my
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>In view of the statement which is contained in the note of your
                            excellency’s predecessor to which I now reply, that the subject was
                            receiving examination with a view to a project of reforms of consular
                            duties, I have thought it well to make the foregoing reference to the
                            attitude of my Government, and to express the hope that an early and
                            satisfactory settlement may be reached.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatches No. 131 of December 27th and
                        No. 135 of the 4th instant have been received. They throw considerable light
                        on the negotiations lately conducted between yourself and the Ministers of
                        State and of the Colonies looking toward a better understanding with regard
                        to commerce between the United States and the Spanish West Indies. The text
                        of the agreement signed January 2, which accompanied your No. 134, has just
                        been received and affords occasion for drawing up the proclamation of the
                        President suspending the additional ten per centum duty on products from the
                        Antilles brought in Spanish vessels to the United States.</p>
                    <p>Enough was already known to satisfy this Government that the negotiation had
                        been carried on with an equal desire on the part of Spain with that which we
                        have shown to reach a broad understanding of the subject free from the
                        technical considerations which have at times impeded it in the past. As we
                        understand the agreement, it removes almost all of the difficulties in the
                        way of that full and natural commercial intercourse which should exist
                        between our ports and the Antilles. The good disposition of His Majesty’s
                        Government has been shown in so many ways in this matter, that it can hardly
                        be doubted that Spain will with equal cheerfulness remove the few remaining
                        causes of complaint. The promised revision of the customs ordinances of
                        Cuba, for example, cannot, it is thought, result otherwise than in the <pb
                            n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0577"/>abolition of the present very
                        objectionable system of disproportionate fines upon foreign shipping for
                        constructive faults in a vessel’s papers, and the substitution for the
                        moiety scheme of penalties some device more just and equitable which, if
                        through error or excessive zeal misapplied, may be wholly undone by
                        executive action. This subject, however, is so fully treated in the recent
                        instructions of this Department that it is merely adverted to now in order
                        that its importance in the relations of the two countries may be kept in
                        view.</p>
                    <p>So, too, with respect to the consular fee based on the exported cargo. The
                        agreement covers this as to the future, and so far as Antillean trade is
                        concerned; but a just disposition of all pending questions would require
                        that the remedy be made general and effective as to past exactions. These
                        matters are commended to your discretion.</p>
                    <p>With relation to the fifth article of the agreement providing that the two
                        Governments shall consider a commercial treaty for the enlargement of the
                        Spanish West Indian trade with the United States, I may remark that the
                        present seems a propitious time for entering upon such a consideration of a
                        subject equally momentous to both. The coming of a new representative of His
                        Majesty, preceded by the reputation won in fields of statecraft and
                        literature, is opportune, and this Government will have much pleasure in
                        giving careful attention to whatever propositions may be made to it by Señor
                        Valera. It may be premature to consider now whether it may be possible to
                        bring about such intimate and reciprocal intercourse as would make the
                        relation between the Antilles and the United ‘States hardly inferior to that
                        with the mother country, but that any commercial step in that direction
                        would promise mutual benefit can hardly be doubted.</p>
                    <p>Congress having called for the correspondence anterior to the late
                        agreeement, copies thereof have been prepared and transmitted by the
                        President, at a recent date, to the Senate, with my report explanatory of
                        the situation. The papers are now in the hands of the printer, and copies
                        will be sent to you as speedily as maybe. For the present, I desire merely
                        to congratulate you anew upon the progress you appear to have made toward a
                        more perfect understanding of the mutual needs and wishes of the two
                        countries in respect of the Antillean trade.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the morning of the 9th instant I received
                        your telegram of the 8th, in which you state that the President’s
                        proclamation will be made public as soon as you have notice from me that
                        royal action is taken to put in execution Articles I, IV, and VI, on the 1st
                        of March next.</p>
                    <p>On the day of the receipt of your telegrams, I called on the Minister of
                        State and informed him of your approval of his proposition to put in
                        operation the articles mentioned. The question then arose as to the best
                        method of carrying them into effect. Señor Elduayen said that he <pb n="478"
                            xml:id="pg_478" facs="0578"/>was embarrassed in the matter by the action
                        of his predecessor in submitting the agreement of January 2 to the Cortes.
                        If that step had not been taken, he would have been left free to put into
                        operation such of its stipulations as he felt authorized to execute, and ask
                        authorization of the Cortes for those which required the approbation of the
                        legislative power. But while Señor Ruiz Gomez may not have intended to
                        submit to the Cortes more than Article III, the project of law prepared by
                        him did in fact submit the whole agreement, and so long as it was pending
                        before the chambers he would not feel authorized to act upon it. He
                        suggested, however, that in view of the fact that the sessions of the Cortes
                        had been suspended and that no action could be had upon the agreement before
                        the 1st of March, it seemed to him that the most practicable thing to do was
                        to make a new agreement embodying the stipulations of the one of January 2,
                        and separating it into two parts, embracing in the first those articles
                        which the Government of Spain had the power to carry out on the 1st of
                        March, and in the second those articles which would require the
                        authorization of the Cortes.</p>
                    <p>I responded that while I had objected in our previous interview to his
                        suggestion of annulling the agreement, I was quite ready to join him in any
                        action which would relieve his Government from the embarrassment which he
                        had explained, provided the stipulations of that agreement were not
                        impaired. It was not the form but the substance of that instrument which I
                        was interested in preserving, and since he had approved of all its articles
                        upon their merits, I would very cheerfully accept his suggestion, if it
                        would facilitate his Government in executing the stipulations.</p>
                    <p>It was accordingly agreed that the minister would have a draft of a new
                        agreement prepared in the sense indicated, and that I should call at the
                        ministry on the 11th instant to examine it with him. This I did at the hour
                        indicated, and Señor Elduayen submitted to me the draft substantially as
                        signed. He said that he had omitted Article V of the agreement of January 2,
                        for the reason that it appeared that it had been suggested by the Spanish
                        Government under a misapprehension that a discriminating tonnage duty was
                        charged in the United States on Spanish vessels. This, it appeared, was not
                        the case and there seemed no necessity for retaining it. Article VIII was
                        also omitted from his draft for the reason that in separating the new
                        agreement into two parts, namely, the stipulations which were to be carried
                        into effect March 1 and those which required the approbation of the Cortes,
                        in neither of which this article could be embraced. The two Governments were
                        always authorized to negotiate on the subject of commercial matters; and the
                        minister said he very heartily indorsed the views of his predecessor as
                        specified in the article, and was prepared to act upon it at the convenience
                        of the United States.</p>
                    <p>I told the minister that as the two articles omitted in his draft had been
                        originally inserted at the request of the Spanish Government I would not
                        object to their omission in view of his declarations respecting them. After
                        some further conversation as to the preparation of the new agreement for
                        signature and fixing upon yesterday, the 13th instant, as the time for that
                        purpose, I took my leave.</p>
                    <p>On yesterday at 3 p.m. I called at the ministry of state, accompanied by Mr.
                        Reed, secretary of legation, who compared with the sub-secretary of state
                        the duplicate original agreement. While this was being done I said to the
                        minister of state that while it had been my desire to preserve intact the
                        agreement of January 2 last, I had yielded to his (the minister’s) request
                        to modify it in order to obviate what he conceived <pb n="479"
                            xml:id="pg_479" facs="0579"/>to be insuperable constitutional and
                        parliamentary objections to its enforcement on the 1st of March, with the
                        understanding that the original agreement was not to be essentially changed
                        in substance, but only in form and in the time of its execution. In the
                        agreement, however, about to be signed there were omitted articles 5 and 8
                        of that of January 2, and while his reasons given for their omission had
                        been accepted by me as satisfactory I thought it well to place these reasons
                        on record in writing. I accordingly handed him the memorandum, of which I
                        inclose a copy, accompanied by a Spanish translation.</p>
                    <p>The minister, after reading it, said that it was a perfectly correct
                        statement, and he was gratified that I had prepared it, as it was a document
                        quite pertinent to and explanatory of the modified agreement. He further
                        stated that in order that there might be no misunderstanding he would
                        address me an official note acknowledging its receipt and express his
                        conformity with its statements.</p>
                    <p>The new agreement was then signed by the minister and myself, in the presence
                        of the secretary of legation and the sub-secretary of state. I now transmit
                        herewith the original agreement belonging to our Government, and I trust
                        that my action in connection therewith may meet with your approval.</p>
                    <p>At 7 o’clock last night I sent you a cablegram advising you of the signing of
                        the new agreement, also that the royal decree putting it in operation March
                        1 on the part of Spain would be published on Saturday next, the 16th, and
                        that I had agreed that the President’s proclamation should appear at as
                        nearly the same time as possible.</p>

                        the 10 per cent, extra duty will be published on to-morrow (Saturday), and
                        asking for the exact text of the new agreement.</p>

                    <p>I sent you at once a cablegram as follows: “New agreement published in

                        Will telegraph full text immediately.”</p>
                    <p>On yesterday afternoon I received a private note from the minister of state,
                        informing me that the King had signed the decree, and that the publication
                        of it would be made this morning in the Gazette, but it was then too late to
                        advise you in time to secure the concurrent issuance of the President’s
                        proclamation. The royal decree embodies the text of the agreement in full,
                        and orders its prompt observance. The minister of ultramar informed me
                        to-day that the instructions to the authorities of Cuba and Porto Rico were
                        being then prepared, and that he expected to telegraph them to-night.</p>
                    <p>At 12.30 to-day I sent you, as requested, a cablegram, giving the text of the
                        agreement, with an explanation as to the omission of articles 5 and 8 of
                        first agreement.</p>

                        at the happy conclusion of the business, and expressed warm desires for

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Señor Portuondo, Cuban deputy in the Cortes,
                        has written an article exposing the glaring inequality, as compared with the
                        Spanish tariff, of the import duties collected in the Cuban custom-houses,
                        and showing their depressing influence upon the industries of that island. I
                        think it will be found interesting and useful in connection with the study
                        which I infer the Department is making of Cuban commercial matters in view
                        of the contemplated treaty negotiations, and I therefore inclose a
                        translation herewith.</p>

                        <head>From “Revista de las Antillas” of February 27, 1884,
                            Translation.</head>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">economical state of cuba</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The second factor of ruin and destruction in Cuba is the import duty. Let
                            us examine the tariff; let us compare and coolly appreciate its errors
                            and its enormities. Our assertion will thus be demonstrated.</p>
                        <p>Cereals pay at present on entering the island to the extent of $0.115 the
                            kilogram if they come from Spain, and to the value of $0.42 if they
                            proceed from foreign nations; or, in other words, $1.15 (5.75 pesetas)
                            in the first case for every 100 kilograms, and $4.20 (21 pesetas) in the
                            second case for every 100 kilograms. Fl<gap quantity="1" unit="words"
                            />urs pay, respectively, $2.25 (11.35 pesetas) and $5.51 (27.55 pesetas)
                            for every 100 kilograms.</p>
                        <p>In reality the export of Peninsula cereals to the Antilles is null, or
                            nearly null, and that of flour, always insignificant in comparison to
                            the consumption which ought to correspond to 2,300,000 inhabitants, is
                            now much less, on account, doubtless, of the growing wants of the
                            consumption in the Peninsula, of the decline of harvests as an <pb
                                n="481" xml:id="pg_481" facs="0581"/>accidental cause, and of the
                            known insufficiency of the production as a permanent cause. The
                            importers in Cuba well know that the grain proceeding from the peninsula
                            is not Spanish in its greater part, but foreign, brought to Spain and
                            re-exported thence for speculation; and the retail merchants and
                            consumers in the Antilles know in the same way that the real price of
                            sale is regulated by the duty which weighs on that proceeding from
                            foreign lands. It is therefore not to be doubted that in order to
                            appreciate the conditions of life and existence in Cuba the starting
                            point is that of 27.55 pesetas as import duty on every 100
                            kilograms.</p>
                        <p>Foreign flours pay in the Peninsula, according to the tariff and laws in
                            vigor, 6.30 pesetas for every 100 kilograms. So that here in the
                            Peninsula, where there is a production which the protectionists pretend
                            to favor, the duty is 6.30 pesetas, whilst in Cuba, where this
                            production does not exist and there is no idea of protection, the duty
                            is 27.55 pesetas. Honest men, those who occupy themselves concerning the
                            life and the fate of this poor consuming people and concerning the labor
                            classes in Spain, think and declare with more than reason that this duty
                            of 6.30 pesetas imposed on food has no justice, nor does it arise from
                            sentiments of humanity. What shall we say of the frightful sum of 27.55
                            pesetas?</p>
                        <p>Meats pay, on their entry into Cuba, according to their various classes,
                            from $0.028 per kilogram, which corresponds to hung beef, to $0.193
                            which corresponds to the superior classes, without counting among them
                            those preserved by the extraction of air. That which is equivalent to
                            $2.80 (14 pesetas) for the first, for every 100 kilograms, and $19.30
                            (91.30 pesetas) for the second, also for every 100 kilograms. The duty
                            which weighs on these same articles in the Peninsula, according to
                            tariff is 2.80 to 5.70 pesetas for every 100 kilograms. So that so
                            indispensable an element of life as is meat is taxed in Spain, on entry,
                            at 2.80 or 5.70 pesetas; which, without doubt is unjust and the cause of
                            the bad food of the working classes. For this reason the poor people do
                            not eat meat nor does hardly the soldier eat it; the most eminent
                            surgeons and military doctors always fear fatal results when they are
                            obliged to operate on these unfortunates who lack the vigor and strength
                            for resisting. There is more than reason for complaint for the Spanish
                            people of the Peninsula, and the energetic protestations which men of
                            good judgment and warm heart express against such a grievance and such a
                            great error are well founded. And if we say this in reference to the
                            consumer who lives in the Peninsula, what shall we say of the
                            inhabitants of the Antilles? Figures speak for us. The state taxes the
                            first 2.80, and taxes the second 14; or exacts from one 5.70 and exacts
                            from the other 91.50.</p>
                        <p>Salt fish pay on entry to Cuba, according to their grades, from $2.45 to
                            $24.10 on each 100 kilograms, or from 12.25 pesetas to 120.50 pesetas.
                            The duty which weighs on these same articles in the tariff of the
                            Peninsula is from 1.50 to 17.50 pesetas every 100 kilograms. That is to
                            say, a difference of from 1.50, to 12.25 or from 17.50 to 120.50.</p>
                        <p>Rice pays in Cuba for import duty, including the subsidy, 52.50 pesetas
                            per 100 kilograms. In the Peninsula, according to the tariff, the duty
                            is 8 pesetas for the same weight. With very great reason this protection
                            and privilege in favor of the Valencia production and detrimental to the
                            consumer is cried out against. And what shall we think or say of justice
                            in the Antilles, where there is no rice production to protect? It
                            suffices to compare figures. The comparison is as 8 to 52.50.</p>
                        <p>The food of the laborer in Cuba comes so dear, in spite of being bad and
                            limited, that in order not to absorb completely the wages it is
                            necessary to raise them to a figure really indefensible; and even then
                            the physical force is poor and of limited resistance. The preceding
                            figures, the exactitude of which there can be no doubt about, show, with
                            vigor, that only by reason of the rigorous tariffs, and even without
                            counting impositions, of which we shall speak later, the subsistence of
                            the working-man in Cuba is infinitely dearer than in Spain, as it is
                            well known, in proportion to the difference of wages.</p>
                        <p>The workingman must, besides, clothe himself. Let us examine also under
                            this head the tariff of Cuba, comparing it with that of the Peninsula.
                            In the first place, and without even entering into numerous details, it
                            is remarked that the groups of texture embrace 28 parts in. the tariff
                            of the Peninsula, whilst in that of Cuba the number mounts to 130, with
                            a quantity of heads and classifications which is known always to
                            constitute a motive of unjust exaction, or frauds and abuses. Further it
                            is observed that in manufactures of cotton and wool, which the working
                            class needs as much in the Antilles as in Europe, these are oppressed
                            with a duty of 2.10 pesetas the kilogram, those with one of 5.18
                            pesetas, and those which pay 3.50 pesetas pay in Cuba up to 20.81
                            pesetas. It must be taken into consideration, in conclusion, that in the
                            duties which affect the fabrics of linen and those of silk, much used in
                            the Antilles by the well-to-do classes, there are even greater
                            differences, as from 4.20 pesetas the kilogram to 23.95, and from 7.50
                            to 69.40. Let it be taken into account that in various of the numbers
                            that we have cited from the tariff of the Peninsula, the reduction
                            lately granted by the Cortes on re-establishing, although only in part
                            of the reform of 1869, is not made.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department is in receipt of a despatch
                        from our consul-general at Havana, setting forth the variety and extent of
                        annoyance and injury attendant, in Cuba, upon the manner in which the laws
                        and regulations concerning passports are there carried out, and, so far as
                        this condition of things affects American citizens, you are desired to make
                        urgent representations to His Catholic Majesty’s Government. The Government
                        of the United States requires no passports of foreigners coming here; but is
                        not for that reason disposed to object in any wise to the just or supposed
                        proper requirements of other Governments in this regard, nor has it done so.
                        The position of the United States, in either aspect above, or in both
                        combined, would seem to be such as to entitle it to a very careful and
                        considerate hearing when it ventures, as it now does, to bring to the
                        attention of a central Government a catalogue of annoyances, vexations, and
                        injuries, visited by the quite unnecessarily loose or more blamable methods
                        of the local officials of that Government, upon all our citizens visiting
                        the island, indiscriminately. This Government now brings no reflection on
                        the requirement of a <hi rend="italic">visé</hi> on the passport given its
                        citizens, or the charge therefor, any more than on the requirement of the
                        passports themselves, but only on the methods in vogue with reference to its
                        affix. The failure to obtain a <hi rend="italic">visé</hi> involves, in the
                        first place, a certain fixed penalty; but no pains are taken to acquaint the
                        visitor that his failure so involves a penalty, while the neglect to demand
                        a passport in many instances, and the omission to <hi rend="italic"
                            >visé</hi> the same, when it is demanded, in many others, are well
                        calculated to suggest to the visitor the non-necessity of such an act. It is
                        when he is about to leave the island that he discovers the infirmities
                        consequent on the absence of the <hi rend="italic">visé</hi>, which should
                        have been required on his arrival. He now finds that he cannot leave the
                        island until his passport has been <hi rend="italic">visaed</hi> at the port
                        where he entered, which may be hundreds of miles distant, and to be reached
                        only by a weekly steamer. Sometimes a new passport, obtained of the
                        consul-general at an expense of $5, <hi rend="italic">visaed</hi> at a
                        further expense of $4.25, is allowed to remove the hindrance to his
                        departure, but not always, and the new passport in that case, it is
                        declared, must be sent to the port of landing for a <hi rend="italic"
                            >visé</hi>. Cases arise where, the steamer sailing at 4 p.m., the
                        visitor is told by official clerks on whom he calls at 2 p.m., that he must
                        come at 3 p.m., and this when these clerks are idle.</p>
                    <p>Again American money has been refused for these charges, though worth 10 per
                        cent, more than Spanish gold; but this is mentioned, not as indicating any
                        disposition to criticise the right of the officials to require payment in
                        the national funds or moneys, only as (in the view of the consul-general) an
                        unnecessary refusal under the circumstances.</p>
                    <p>It may be, of course, contended that ignorance of the law on the part of our
                        citizens is no valid excuse for neglecting to ask for and procure the
                        necessary <hi rend="italic">visé</hi>, and that our own steamship companies
                        (where these are the carriers) should find it their pleasure, if not their
                        interest, to make these requirements respecting <hi rend="italic">visé</hi>
                        known to the public. It remains nevertheless true that it should lie within
                        the execution <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0583"/>of the passport law
                        of His Majesty’s Government on the Island to reduce by judicious means,
                        these annoyances and injuries to an almost inappreciable quantity and this
                        Government has a natural right to expect that no American citizen shall in
                        any case be prevented from returning to his home, at his own free will, by
                        the simple neglect of any Cuban officer whatever to do his official
                        duty.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your No. 168, of the 14th ultimo, has been
                        received. The text, which it forwards, of the substitutionary agreement
                        signed by you and the minister of state on the 13th ultimo, has been
                        compared with the text as received by cable and proclaimed by the President,
                        and the latter is found to have been substantially correct, as you will have
                        seen by the copies sent to you.</p>
                    <p>The reasons given for the omission of Articles V and VIII are accepted.
                        Article VIII of the original agreement of January 2 was never regarded by us
                        as essential to an understanding or as importing more than a mutual
                        declaration that the two Governments desired a better and more comprehensive
                        commercial agreement than that thus created. The declaration simply
                        recognized an existing fact; it did not create a situation. In this sense,
                        your reference thereto in the memorandum (inclosure No. 2) which accompanies
                        your No. 168 is approved.</p>
                    <p>The situation as regards the omission of Article V is somewhat different. It
                        is true, as the minister says, that in the United States there is imposed no
                        discriminating tonnage duty against Spanish ships. Hence there was no mutual
                        obligation to decree their removal. But the tonnage duties in Cuba and Porto
                        Rico are understood to be higher than those in our ports, and in the case of
                        vessels making regular trips at short intervals, more onerous than ours. It
                        is very desirable that the tonnage dues on Spanish and American shipping
                        should be approximately equal and uniform in the ports of the two countries.
                        The omission of Article V cannot therefore be construed as an admission on
                        our part that such an equalization of treatment is no longer desirable.</p>
                    <p>A fuller instruction, touching the negotiation of a complete commercial
                        treaty between the two countries, is in process of preparation, and will
                        soon be sent to you.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I transmit herewith for your information
                        copies of a letter addressed to me by the Secretary of the Treasury, and my
                        reply thereto, touching a request made by the Spanish consul at Baltimore to
                        be furnished by the collector of customs at that port with periodical
                        certificates of the cargoes of sugar, mollasses, and tobacco imported from
                        Cuba and Porto Rico, giving the name and flag of the vessel, date of entry,
                        port of clearance, number and description of packages, and weight in
                        American pounds, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>This request of Mr. Navarro, the consul, would appear to have been made under
                        a misapprehension of the purport and scope of the third article of the
                        agreement signed at Madrid February 13, 1884. Such a request has not been
                        made, so far as known, by any other consular officer of Spain in the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>From the reply made to Mr. Folger’s inquiry, it will be seen that this
                        Government construes the engagement in accordance with its evident intent,
                        and will require its customs officers to give to any Spanish consul,
                        whenever he may request it, a certificate in respect to the cargo of sugar
                        or tobacco brought by any designated vessel to our ports. Al though molasses
                        is not mentioned in the agreement, it may be deemed comprised under the
                        general phrase “sugar.”</p>
                    <p>It is of course, evident, that the agreement could not have contemplated
                        requiring our customs administration to prepare for the information of the
                        Spanish consuls detailed periodical statements of every package of the
                        articles in question brought to the United States from the Antilles. Besides
                        entailing an amount of labor not necessary to compliance with the agreement,
                        and which this Government, even in the interest of its own revenues, could
                        not well ask of any foreign Government under like circumstances, there is
                        involved a question of responsibility which appears to be decisive. There is
                        the distinction between courteously furnishing specific information when it
                        may be needed and requested, and an obligation to make a comprehensive and
                        exact return, omitting not even isolated packages found in a general cargo
                        or entered by passengers as personal effects.</p>

                        <p>The collector states that a compliance with the request made involves
                            considerable labor, and would require a regular periodical report to the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have had the honor to receive your
                            letter of the 13th instant, in which you inform me of the request of the
                            Spanish consul at Baltimore to be furnished from time to time with
                            certificates of the cargoes of sugar, molasses, and tobacco imported
                            from Cuba and Porto Rico, giving the name and flag of the vessel, date
                            of entry, port of clearance, number of packages, and weight in American
                            pounds, &amp;c. You mention the collector’s statement that compliance
                            with this request would involve considerable labor and require “a
                            regular periodical report to the consul.” You accordingly ask whether
                            these certificates are required under the recent agreement.</p>
                        <p>In reply, I have the honor to state my belief, founded on the reports of
                            Mr. Foster, who negotiated the agreement, that the third article of the
                            agreement of February 13, 1884, merely contemplates furnishing in any
                            particular case, when specially requested by the Spanish consul, a
                            statement of the quantities of sugar, molasses, and tobacco forming the
                            cargo of a vessel.</p>
                        <p>The object of the arrangement is to enable the Spanish authorities to
                            enforce the collection of the export tax levied on those products in the
                            Antilles, in respect of which the insular revenues are often defrauded.
                            A case recently occurred at Cienfuegos where 1,000 hogsheads of sugar
                            were shipped without paying export dues. The knowledge that a ready
                            means of detecting such frauds is available on the arrival of the cargo
                            here would, it was thought, check the practice. When fraud is suspected
                            by the Spanish officers, the consul can immediately procure from the
                            collector a statement of the quantity imported by the suspected vessel,
                            and thus substantiate or disprove the suspicion.</p>
                        <p>The intent was clearly that in case of need a special favor might be
                            asked and granted. Periodical reports in detail of all importations of
                            this character would practically entail upon the several custom-houses a
                            responsibility in the interest of protecting the Spanish revenues which
                            it could not have been intended to transfer from the Spanish consuls to
                            our collectors of customs.</p>
                        <p>I would suggest that a circular be sent to the collectors of customs,
                            instructing them that whenever a Spanish consular officer shall request
                            the certificate contemplated in article 3 of the agreement of February
                            13, 1884, it is to be promptly furnished in respect of any designated
                            vessel, and will be confined to a statement of the quantities of sugar,
                            molasses, and tobacco brought by such vessel.</p>
                        <p>A copy of this correspondence will be furnished to the Spanish minister
                            here and to our representative at Madrid, for their information.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I transmit herewith a copy and translation of
                        a note of the 26th ultimo from the Minister of State, received on the 29th,
                        on the subject of the Cuban embargoed estate claims. The minister, after
                        excusing the delay which has occurred in replying to my note of November 14,
                        last, explains that the words “new claims” in his predecessor’s note of
                        November 3 did not imply that they were not already known to the Spanish
                        Government, but that they were considered new in relation to those already
                        decided by the late commission. He repeats the declarations of Señor Ruiz
                        Gomez, that the importance of the sums claimed and the attendant
                        circumstances require a careful examination and report from the Minister of
                        Ultramar, and while he assures me that this will be made with all possible
                        diligence, he reminds me that our own Government knows, by its own
                        experience in considering the reclamations of Spain in regard to the Florida
                        and civil war claims, how delays in the settlement of questions of this
                        character must necessarily occur.</p>
                    <p>In view of my expected early visit to Washington I have thought it best to
                        defer the acknowledgment of this note until after I have had a conference
                        with you. I am promised by the minister an interview to discuss this as well
                        as other pending subjects before my departure, and I hope to be able to give
                        you a more satisfactory account of the views of the Spanish Government
                        respecting these claims than I have thus far done.</p>

                            in answer to that which my predecessor, Señor Ruiz Gomez, had addressed

                            the legation, under date of the 2d and 3d July of last year, on account
                            of the embargo of estates of North American citizens during the late

                            judgment the words which your excellency controverts, to wit, “new
                            claims” (nuevas reclamaciones), employed by my predecessor in referring
                            to those presented on the preceding 2d and 3d July, do not signify that
                            they were not already known to the Government of His Majesty, but that
                                <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0588"/>they were considered new in
                            relation to those which had just been decided by the late commission of
                            arbitration, on account of which Spain was on the point of paying to the
                            United States 10,000,000 of reals, approximately, an amount of some
                            importance for the resources of the Spanish treasury, and at present
                            already paid in its totality.</p>
                        <p>As to the other arguments contained in your excellency’s note, to which I
                            have the honor to answer, it does not appear to me that they weaken in
                            any respect that which my predecessor expressed to your excellency on
                            the 3d of November last. In examining the voluminous correspondence
                            remitted to this ministry by your legation on the 2d and 3d of July of
                            last year, from which it results that Spain, which within recent dates
                            has paid to the United States more than thirty million reals, would
                            still appear as debtor for another hundred, my predecessor informed your
                            excellency that the importance of the sums which were claimed, as well
                            as the necessity of verifying their correctness, and, above all, to
                            ascertain if the claimants compared with the subjects of His Majesty had
                            made use of all the measures which Spanish legislation concedes to them
                            for the defense of their interests, the authorities of Cuba denying them
                            justice, the only case in which the Government of His Majesty admits
                            diplomatic action—all these circumstances exacted a careful examination
                            and a just report from the Ministry of Ultramar (colonies), the only
                            competent authority to make the necessary explanations on each one of
                            the questions which are the object of the reclamations of your
                            excellency.</p>
                        <p>On my part I will add that these [claims] have already been transmitted
                            to the said ministry, recommending to it all possible diligence without
                            considering it necessary that I should repeat that the Government of His
                            Majesty will attend to the reclamations presented by your excellency in
                            your notes of the 2d and 3d of July of last year, in so far as they may
                            be just and equitable, with the same spirit of equity of which it has
                            given repeated proofs to the Government of the American Union, hoping
                            that the latter will not, in its turn, fail to take into consideration
                            the difficulties which oppose a resolution as promptly as Spain would
                            wish, since it knows by experience, recalling not only our already
                            repeated reclamations relating to the settlement of the Florida debt,
                            but the more recent claims arising in consequence of the injures
                            suffered by Spanish subjects during the war of secession, the
                            indispensable procedure necessary for the settlement of questions of
                            such a nature, as well as the delays which, on account of its character,
                            it must necessarily encounter.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It will be seen by the inclosures herewith
                        that steps have at last been taken by the Spanish Government to carry out
                        the long-promised reform in its consular tariff. A commission has been
                        appointed by royal decree to revise the existing consular tariffs with a
                        view to the submission of the projected reform to the Cortes for its
                        approbation.</p>
                    <p>The minister of state in his “exposition” refers, among other reasons for the
                        revision, to the international engagements recently contracted, doubtless
                        having in mind the additional article of our agreement of February 13 last,
                        respecting the abolition of consular tonnage dues for the West India
                        Islands. I have not omitted the opportunity, afforded by the publication of
                        the royal decree nominating the commission, to bring to his attention the
                        remonstrances of our Government against these tonnage dues. In my note of
                        the 2d instant, of which a copy is inclosed, I have recited the
                        correspondence of this legation on the subject, and have asked the Minister
                        of State to bring this correspondence to the notice of the commission with
                        such favorable recommendation as will secure the abolition of the
                        objectionable dues for the entire commerce between the United States and
                        Spain.</p>
                    <p>I propose, also, as far as I can, to secure the co-operation of my diplomatic
                            <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0589"/>colleagues of the leading
                        commercial nations by notes of similar purport as the one I have sent to the
                        Minister of State. The representatives of Great Britain and of other
                        Governments have already signified to me their intention to follow my
                        action.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Señor</hi>: On the 15th June, 1874, the consular
                            tariffs were revised with an object to regulate and make uniform on
                            equitable bases the collection of the obventional fees received by the
                            agents of Spain in foreign countries on account of the numerous acts of
                            their official duties, providing at the same time that the special
                            services which they render may be justly recompensed by the persons
                            soliciting them.</p>
                        <p>The well known and constant spread which mercantile transactions have
                            acquired since then, the reforms introduced in the public
                            administration, and even the indications of opinion, now advise that all
                            possible facility be given to trade, modifying the orders and the
                            application of regulations little justified, and harmonizing the
                            consular tariff with the international compromises recently contracted,
                            without on this account leaving unprovided for the legitimate
                            remuneration of the guarantee which the intervention of consular agents
                            offers to commerce in its lucrative operations.</p>
                        <p>In order to prepare this work with indispensable care and attention, so
                            as to present it to the approbation of the Cortes, the undersigned
                            minister believes the nomination of a commission composed of
                            functionaries of recognized competency is necessary, which may in a
                            brief time carefully examine the points which ought to be reformed, fix
                            with clearness the articles of the tariff, with the object of preventing
                            doubtful interpretations, and draw up the project of the new consular
                            tariff, endeavoring to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of commerce
                            without impairing the interests of the state.</p>
                        <p>Founded on these reasons the undersigned minister has the honor to submit
                            to the approbation of Your Majesty the following project of decree.</p>

                            notice the enlightened exposition which your excellency addressed to His
                            Catholic Majesty on the 27th ultimo and the royal decree of the same
                            date, providing for the appointment of a commission to revise the
                            existing Spanish consular tariff and to have it conform to existing
                            international compromises and the freedom of commercial intercourse with
                            other nations. I trust I am not mistaken in the conviction I entertain
                            that in the appointment of this commission your excellency had in view,
                            among other reforms, the abolition of the tonnage dues levied and
                            collected by Spanish consuls on cargoes of vessels in the ports of the
                            United States and other nations.</p>
                        <p>I need not remind your excellency of the attitude assumed by my
                            Government on this subject, but I beg to suggest that the attention of
                            said commission may be directed to the correspondence which has passed
                            between this legation and your excellency’s department, and especially
                            to the notes of this legation of January 7, 1882, July 16, 1883, and
                            January 22 of the present year. The last of these notes contains a
                            recapitulation of the views of my Government, showing that it is
                            virtually an <hi rend="italic">export</hi> to, levied and collected by
                            Spanish consuls in the ports of the United States, and that as all
                            export taxes are prohibited by the Constitution of the United States, it
                            is an exaction of duties in which it is not possible for my Government
                            to acquiesce. In view of the fact that your excellency, with a
                            commendable spirit of commercial freedom, has already agreed with me, by
                            virtue of the agreement of February 13 last, to ask the Cortes to
                            authorize the abolition of this duty so far as trade with Cuba and Porto
                            Rico is concerned, I do not doubt that it will be decided by said
                            commission to extend the abolition to the entire commerce between the
                            United States and Spain.</p>
                        <p>Confident that your excellency will submit this subject with such
                            favorable recommendation to the attention of the commission referred to
                            as will secure an entire abolition of these objectionable dues,</p>
                        <p>I have, &amp;c.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose herewith, for your
                        information, a copy of the “bases” agreed upon for the proposed reform of
                        the Spanish customs regulations, as published in El Correo and copied by El
                        Estandarte of the 29th of March last. I also inclose a translation of such
                        of them as are deemed of interest to us.</p>
                    <p>Since the publication of these “bases,” I have made inquiry in regard
                        thereto, and have ascertained that a commission is now engaged in the
                        ministry of hacienda, (finance) on the revision of the regulations on the
                        bases referred to. I am also informed that the new regulations agreed upon
                        will not require the approval of the Cortes, but will be carried into effect
                        by royal decree.</p>
                    <p>It is expected that these new regulations will be a decided improvement upon
                        those now in force. The most important reform, however, is that mentioned in
                        base twelfth, which proposes the doing away -with what is known as the
                        moiety system.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The recent departure of one Carlos Aguero with
                        a few adherents from Key West in a small schooner for Cuba has attracted
                        considerable attention, and coupled with the reports of the secret
                        organization of other similar expeditions, has been given an importance
                        greater probably than it alone merits. For your information and for such use
                        as occasion may hereafter demand, I communicate to you herewith the facts in
                        the matter.</p>
                    <p>Aguero being in Key West, a demand for his extradition under the treaty was
                        made by Spain. He was arrested in January last, pursuant to the extradition
                        statute of the United States, and taken before a commissioner, who, finding
                        the proofs insufficient, discharged him from custody.</p>
                    <p>In a note to this Department of the 17th ultimo Mr. Valera, the Spanish
                        minister here, referred to conspiracies of Cuban refugees in this country
                        against the Government of Spain, and stated that some of them professed a
                        purpose of carrying their hostile designs into effect by means of dynamite.
                        Mr. Valera further stated as a proof of public sentiment at Key West that
                        upon the occasion of Aguero’s discharge from custody there, the collector of
                        customs and others gave public utterance to their exultation, and the
                        minister expressed a hope that through the means at the disposal of the
                        Attorney-General a remedy would be applied for this condition of affairs.
                        You will notice that no charge against specific individuals was made other
                        than the statement as to the collector’s utterances, I, however,
                        communicated the substance of Mr. Valera’s suggestion to the
                        Attorney-General, in order that the officers of the Department of Justice
                        might be upon the alert.</p>
                    <p>Under date of the 27th March, Señor Valera informed the Department that
                        Spanish newspapers in this country were threatening, and that he had
                        received private information that Carlos Aguero was organizing, a hostile
                        expedition at Key West against Cuba, for the prevention of which he asked
                        that all means at the hands of the Executive might be employed.</p>
                    <p>Upon the receipt of this note, I immediately communicated with the Secretary
                        of the Treasury, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Attorney-General,
                        stating that Carlos Aguero, a fugitive whose extradition was recently
                        requested and not granted, was reported by the Spanish minister as
                        organizing and equipping at Key West a hostile expedition against Cuba with
                        over 100 men in his party, fully armed, and provided with bombs and other
                        destructive explosives; that such an expedition falls clearly under the
                        provisions of the neutrality laws, exposes its authors to criminal
                        prosecutions, and that it is incumbent upon this country to investigate the
                        report, and, if verified, to use all available means to prevent the unlawful
                        act. I therefore requested the Attorney-General to give by telegraph such
                        orders as might be necessary for the guidance of his officers in the case,
                        and suggested to the Secretary of the treasury that, as the Treasury
                        officials at Key West had been indicated as sympathizing with Aguero, it
                        might be necessary to conduct the investigation through other agents.</p>
                    <p>Both the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney-General immediately <pb
                            n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0594"/>sent telegraphic instructions to
                        the officers at Key West to prevent the departure of the expedition; revenue
                        cutters were dispatched there, and orders given by the Secretary of the Navy
                        to the officers of the United States steamship Vandalia, then in that port,
                        to aid in the protection of the neutrality of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding these exertions, Aguero escaped in the night of the 1st
                        ultimo in a small schooner with some adherents. There is, however, no
                        confirmation of the report that they were armed with bombs or had with them
                        means of offensive warfare other than their personal equipment.</p>
                    <p>The United States steamship Swatara having arrived at Key West, orders were
                        immediately sent that the Swatara and the Vandalia should proceed toward
                        Cuban waters in order to intercept the expedition, if possible, and they
                        were aided in the neighborhood of our coast by revenue cutters. The
                        expedition, however, succeeded, I am informed, in effecting a landing upon
                        the coast of the island. The schooner which conveyed them returned to Key
                        West, and judicial proceedings were immediately commenced against it and the
                        crew.</p>
                    <p>Upon the 5th instant, the Attorney-General ordered one of the most active and
                        efficient assistant attorneys in his Department to go at once to Key West,
                        giving him full authority in writing to do all that could be done to enforce
                        the neutrality laws, to prevent any violation of them, and to arrest and
                        break up any such combinations as are supposed to exist for the purpose of
                        invading the island of Cuba in vessels armed and equipped in Florida.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Blair, the assistant attorney, immediately started for Key West, and has
                        been energetically engaged in the duty assigned him. Besides his authority
                        from the Department of Justice, he took a letter from the Secretary of the
                        Treasury giving him authority in connection with the customs authorities and
                        the revenue cutters.</p>
                    <p>On account of the distrust in the collector of customs, a special agent of
                        the Treasury Department was also sent to Key West, and is now there, and the
                        President has removed the collector of customs at that point.</p>
                    <p>In a note to the Department of the 10th instant, Señor Valera represented
                        that he had received trustworthy information that the excitement at Key West
                        against the Spanish consul was such that his life was in danger, and the
                        minister requested that all available means might be employed to insure the
                        personal safety of that officer.</p>
                    <p>This information was immediately conveyed to the Attorney-General, with the
                        suggestion that instructions be telegraphed to the agent of the Department
                        of Justice at Key West to at once adopt, after consultation with the other
                        Federal authorities, whatever measures might seem expedient for the personal
                        safety of the Spanish consul and the protection of the consulate from
                        violence, informing him also that Mr. Valera’s statement had been
                        communicated to the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy, so that
                        the aid of forces in barracks at Key West, or on board of any naval vessel
                        there, might be availed of should such an extreme step seem to be
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>To the Secretary of the Navy I suggested that the commanding officer of any
                        vessel visiting Key West should be properly instructed, so that if mob
                        violence be apprehended the Spanish consul might be protected or afforded a
                        secure resting place on board, and a letter upon the same subject was
                        addressed to the Secretary of War.</p>
                    <p>Upon April 10, the date of Mr. Valera’s note, the United States district
                        attorney in Key West telegraphed to the Attorney-General that the Spanish
                        consul had received on the night of the 9th, from the Captain-General <pb
                            n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0595"/>of Cuba, a dispatch stating that
                        one Anrelio Mayol had left Havana on the steamer Hutchinson, alleging that
                        “he goes to kill the Spanish consul.” The district attorney added that he
                        had procured warrants for the arrest of Mayol, and the sheriff, with the
                        assistance of the revenue cutter, had arrested him on the arrival of the
                        steamer; that the district attorney had appeared for the consul before the
                        justice of the peace, and Mayol had been bound over to keep the peace for
                        one month to await further evidence. As the United States vessel Tennessee,
                        flag-ship of the North Atlantic squadron, was then present at Key West, it
                        was deemed unnecessary to invoke military aid, especially as the military
                        barracks there are not now occupied, and it would have been necessary to
                        send troops from another post. The Secretary of War was so informed.</p>
                    <p>Under date of the 12th instant, the Attorney-General transmitted to me a copy
                        of a telegram from Mr. Blair, the assistant attorney deputed to aid in
                        enforcing the neutrality laws, reporting his arrival at Key West, and the
                        Attorney-General added that he would immediately telegraph him to see to the
                        protection of the Spanish consular representative, and that Mr. Blair had
                        instructions of the most peremptory character to do all in his power to
                        maintain the neutrality of this country and to repress any attempt to
                        violate the law by persons who project or contemplate armed expeditions
                        against the island of Cuba.</p>
                    <p>Under the same date he communicated another telegram from Mr. Blair, stating
                        that Mayol had been arrested on arrival, was under bonds to keep the peace,
                        was carefully watched, and that Admiral Cooper, in command of the North
                        Atlantic fleet, had taken every precaution to protect the Spanish
                        consul.</p>
                    <p>In the mean time the Department, on the 11th instant, had informed Mr. Valera
                        that an arrangement had been made by which the special agent of the
                        Department of Justice at Key West might, in case of need, command the aid of
                        any Federal force which might be at that place both in enforcing the laws
                        and in protecting the Spanish consulate. For this action Mr. Valera returned
                        his thanks in a note of the 14th April.</p>
                    <p>Upon the 15th instant I informed Mr. Valera, referring to his note of the
                        10th, of the action in the matter of Mayol.</p>
                    <p>Under date of the 14th instant Mr. Valera represented that he had information
                        that a hostile armament against Cuba was preparing at New Orleans. * * *</p>
                    <p>The action heretofore set forth of this Government, in sending a special
                        agent of the Department of Justice and one from the Treasury Department to
                        Key West, the active movements of the national vessels, and the course of
                        the President in removing the present collector of customs at that port,
                        sufficiently show that this Government effectively carries out its desire to
                        protect its shores from violation of international obligations and
                        neutrality laws, and to prevent its territory from being made the base of
                        hostilities against a friendly government.</p>
                    <p>Upon the receipt of Mr. Valera’s note in relation to the rumored contemplated
                        expedition from New Orleans I immediately communicated with my colleagues,
                        who have taken appropriate steps similar to those taken at Key West, but I
                        am informed by the Attorney-General that no one in New Orleans knows of any
                        expedition. The officers of the Government, however, are upon the watch, and
                        will use every exertion to prevent any expedition leaving our shores, should
                        one be contemplated.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I herewith inclose a copy and translation of
                        the law just passed by the Cortes conferring upon the Executive the power to
                        adopt certain dispositions of an economical and mercantile character
                        affecting the islands of Cuba and Porto Rico. It is what is known as the
                        “authorizations,” which the ministry asked of the Cortes to remedy the
                        embarrassed condition of the West Indian provinces, and which were under
                        discussion for two weeks, and after an animated debate were finally passed
                        almost without opposition.</p>
                    <p>It was conceded on all sides that the situation, especially of Cuba, was
                        critical; that relief in some shape was necessary with as little delay as
                        possible; and the ministry contended that as the Cortes were not willing to
                        remain in session during the heated term sufficiently long to consider and
                        adopt the requisite measures of relief, it would be better to confer upon
                        the Executive full power to concert and carry out these measures during the
                        legislative recess.</p>
                    <p>The first of the “authorizations” is to make all possible reductions in
                        expenses of the public service. Already the ministry have reduced the budget
                        of expenses $2,000,000 over last year, leaving the total expenses of Cuba
                        $32,000,000. It is contended by many of the senators and deputies from that
                        island that this amount ought to be reduced to $24,000,000 or $26,000,000,
                        but the ministry declare this to be impossible.</p>
                    <p>The second measure of relief authorized is the transfer to the budget of the
                        Peninsula of the expense of the diplomatic service in America and of the
                        island of Fernando Po, two items heretofore charged to the Cuban treasury,
                        and which have been the occasion of long-continued complaint. It is also
                        contemplated to relieve the West Indian provinces of a considerable part of
                        the mail service now charged to them.</p>
                    <p>The third authorization is understood to confer upon the ministry the power
                        to make any reductions it may think proper in the tariff of imports and
                        exports or in the other branches of taxation, only being limited to
                        maintaining the obligations of the budget. Sugar is especially mentioned,
                        because it is one of the burdens most complained of; and it is anticipated
                        that the reduction in the import duties would be brought about by means of
                        the commercial treaties contemplated in the seventh authorization. The
                        slight reduction made in the export duty on sugar by the decree of June 5,
                        sent in my No. 232 of the 26th instant, does not satisfy the planters, and
                        an effort will be made to obtain still further reductions.</p>
                    <p>The fourth authorization is for the purpose of coming to some arrangement
                        with the holders of the Cuban bonds, and other creditors, whereby the debt
                        may be funded at a lower rate of interest. The interest and other annual
                        charges on the Cuban debt were during the last fiscal year $10,186,028, or
                        nearly one third of the entire budget, and a large part of the debt is yet
                        unfunded and no interest is paid thereon.</p>
                    <p>The fifth relates to the conversion or withdrawal of the paper currency of
                        the Spanish Bank of Havana, which was issued to meet the expenses of the
                        civil war in Cuba, and which was in the nature of a forced loan. It is
                        estimated that there still remains in circulation $41,000,000 of this paper.
                        It bears a heavy discount under gold, and has <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497"
                            facs="0597"/>exerted a most embarrassing influence on all commercial
                        transactions. Coupled with this is the sixth paragraph of the law which
                        authorizes the remission of a portion of indebtedness of tax delinquents and
                        the acceptance of this currency in whole or in part for the remission.</p>
                    <p>The seventh section of the law authorizes an increase in the Peninsula tariff
                        duties on foreign sugars in the interest of Antillean importation, and to
                        celebrate commercial treaties with other Governments in respect to the trade
                        of Cuba and Porto Rico. The law as originally introduced was unlimited in
                        its application, but an amendment adopted by the Cortes confined the
                        complete authorization as to treaties to the West Indian provinces, but
                        permits the ministry to negotiate treaties a fleeting the Peninsula on
                        condition that they are subject to the ratification of the Cortes. It is
                        understood that this law confers upon the Executive full power to ratify and
                        put the commercial treaties in operation without further legislative action.
                        In the discussion in the Cortes the relations of the Antilles with the
                        United States were frequently referred to, and this section was framed
                        mainly with a view to the execution of a treaty with our Government,
                        although a slight reference was made by the Minister of Ultramar to a
                        possible treaty with Great Britain. It is not believed, however, that it is
                        seriously contemplated to secure a commercial arrangement with any country
                        other than the United States, by which the export trade of Cuba can be
                        improved.</p>
                    <p>The eighth section relates to the trade between the Peninsula and the
                        Antilles, by which it is contemplated to reduce the tariff on specified
                        articles and to hasten the establishment of coastwise or free trade between
                        the mother country and these provinces; and the ninth has reference to the
                        consumption tax on liquors in Cuba.</p>
                    <p>Up to this point, the law, as passed, is a substantial adoption of the
                        project submitted to the Cortes by the ministry, but the following sections
                        were added in the Cortes.</p>
                    <p>The first addition, or tenth section, confers authority to promote the free
                        immigration of laborers to the Antilles. The disorganized condition of
                        labor, especially in Cuba, growing out of the emancipation of the slaves, it
                        is alleged, is one of the chief causes of the present depression of the
                        industries of the island, and it was urged in the Cortes that the best
                        method of remedying this matter was the introduction of free laborers by
                        immigration.</p>
                    <p>By virtue of the eleventh section, it is contemplated to substitute the
                        tobacco of Cuba for that part which the Government has heretofore obtained
                        from foreign countries for the national monopolies, and by other means to
                        encourage the production and sale of this important article of Cuban
                        growth.</p>
                    <p>The twelfth section confers upon the ministry full power to reorganize the
                            <hi rend="italic">personnel</hi> of the administration of the colonies,
                        establishing a civil service therefor, and making other changes to secure
                        its greater efficiency. Two causes of complaint on this subject have been
                        given great prominence, one being that the service in the Antilles has been
                        reserved exclusively for families of the home Government, and the natives or
                        residents of the islands almost entirely excluded; and the second, that bad
                        administration and corruption, are rather the rule than the exception.</p>
                    <p>Another great need of the islands is said to be better means of internal
                        communication. To improve this state of things in Cuba, the Minister of
                        Ultramar is authorized to modify the existing conditions for the
                        construction of the Central Railroad.</p>
                    <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0598"/>
                    <p>The last section gives the Executive power to so amend the mortgage law of
                        Cuba as to give greater protection to loans upon estates, and to assimilate
                        that law to the existing legislation of Spain.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing review will show that almost unlimited power is conferred upon
                        the Executive, and the passage of the law is a striking proof both of the
                        confidence which the Cortes repose in the present ministry and of the
                        conviction that the condition of the Antilles demands important reforms.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my No. 249 of this date, I reported one of
                        the measures adopted to relieve the depressed condition of Cuba in the
                        remission of 50 per cent, of delinquent taxes estimated to exceed
                        $5,000,000, and the acceptance in payment of the balance in the depreciated
                        war currency. The criticisms of the Madrid press on that measure have been
                        followed by an exposition of the methods observed by the Spanish Bank of
                        Havana in the management of this issue of war currency, of which I inclose a
                        copy and translation, from the Imparcial of the 21st instant.</p>
                    <p>From this it appears that owing, to the good credit sustained by the Spanish
                        Bank of Havana, it was intrusted by the Government with the emission and
                        redemption of the large issue of paper currency which it became necessary to
                        make to aid in meeting the expenses of the civil war. But the bank also made
                        use of the authority it possessed by its charter and increased the issue of
                        its own bills to the extreme limit of its legal circulation, exceeding
                        $20,000,000. At first both issues were maintained at par with gold, but the
                        natural result of excessive issue followed. The bank was authorized to
                        suspend redemption, and both the Government and bank paper, which were in
                        the same form and confounded by the public, the one with the Other, shared
                        the same fate and depreciated to one-third their face value in gold. The
                        bank, taking advantage of the heavy discount, bought in its own paper, so
                        that in 1881 its circulation had been reduced from $20,198,060 to
                        $4,043,280, realizing, as is alleged, a profit thereby of about $10,000,000,
                        and by the official statement published on the 17th instant the only paper
                        currency now out is that of the national treasury, which amounts to
                        $41,427,474.75.</p>
                    <p>It is further alleged that the bank has during this period from time to time
                        taken advantage of the fluctuations of the market to make new issues of its
                        own paper in favorable seasons, and to withdraw the same when the
                        depreciation was the greatest, thus making a considerable profit out of the
                        transactions.</p>
                    <p>The inference of the newspaper is that it is not surprising that “reforms are
                        found necessary to raise the island of Cuba from its prostration.”</p>

                        <p>The reforms established up to the present time in compliance with the
                            authorizations disclose a tendency worthy of applause—that of availing
                            of every possible means of taking up the notes which the Spanish Bank of
                            Havana omitted on account of the Cuban treasury.</p>
                        <p>That emission, designed to meet the war expenses with the commendable
                            purpose that it should be carried out under the protection of the
                            respectable credit engaged by the Spanish Bank, had such good results at
                            first that the notes circulated without uneasiness, thanks to the
                            facility of their exchange at the counter of the bank; but afterwards,
                            this becoming difficult, disasters arose from which the Antillian
                            treasury has not yet been able to free itself.</p>
                        <p>As an evil which now has no other remedy than that of diminishing as much
                            as possible the circulation, we ought not, as it would seem, to give our
                            attention to an examination of the past, but lend support to every
                            effort tending to the extinction of the debt which weighs upon the
                            island of Cuba.</p>
                        <p>But as the Government, in the preamble of the decree on the condonation
                            of debits, has revealed to the country the errors of the ultramar
                            administration, we have to add to the abuses pointed out by the ministry
                            of ultramar certain acts which, without precisely constituting an abuse,
                            have contributed to complicate the economical situation of the Great
                            Antilla, showing that they have not only engendered difficulties by the
                            irregularity of administrative proceedings, but also by the toleration
                            which has been extended to extensive stock-jobbing, growing out of the
                            nature of the operation.</p>
                        <p>We hope that what we have to say about this mass of bank notes, which,
                            after having so greatly disturbed all transactions, must now be taken up
                            by measures which diminish the receipts of the Cuban budget, will serve
                            as a lesson in the future.</p>
                        <p>When there was necessity to raise means to meet the war expenses, the
                            Spanish Bank of Havana was authorized to increase the emission of notes
                            on account of the Cuban treasury, and those notes were issued in the
                            same manner as those of the bank, hence one was confounded with the
                            other in circulation, both participating in the same vicissitudes.</p>
                        <p>The natural consequences of a superabundant circulation of paper, payable
                            on presentation, soon arose. The moment arrived in which the vaults of
                            the bank could not meet the demands, and it was relieved from the
                            obligation of paying the notes which were presented for redemption.</p>
                        <p>There at once came a gradual depreciation, which at last represented a
                            loss of two-thirds of the value of the notes. These reached a discount
                            at the rate of $296 in paper for $100 in gold.</p>
                        <p>Did the Spanish Bank of Havana, which had, according to its own legally
                            authorized emission, nearly attained the entire amount of its
                            circulation, amounting in 1873 to $20,198,060, avail itself of the
                            gradual depreciation of the notes to withdraw from circulation those
                            emitted on account of the Cuban treasury? Certainly not, but its own;
                            hence in March, 1881, it only had of its own emission $4,043,280 in
                            circulation, having realized a profit of $9,755,605 in gold, as is shown
                            from day to day since 1868 in a work published in 1881.</p>
                        <p>Since then the bank has completed its work in such a way that, according
                            to the last balances published in the <hi rend="italic">Gaceta de
                                Madrid</hi> of the 17th instant, there were no other notes in
                            circulation than those for which the Cuban treasury was reponsible.</p>
                        <p>That circulation amounts at present to the sum of $41,427,474.75, and
                            some years must yet pass before it is canceled, while the bank has been
                            able to take up its own authorized circulation without other
                            difficulties than that of making new emissions of its notes at times of
                            an improved rate of exchange, in order to take up a larger sum during
                            the periods of depreciation.</p>
                        <p>The profit obtained by this operation has been at the expense of public
                            prosperity, because the notes of the bank emission being taken as cash
                            the public has lost the whole amount of the discount when the bank
                            withdrew them.</p>
                        <p>And this has been going on during several years, without the Government
                            fixing its attention upon it, which demonstrates that there is much
                            carelessness in Spanish administration.</p>
                        <p>We do not censure the bank, other than that having constituted itself the
                            guardian of the war emission it did not endeavor to save more than its
                            own. Like good merchants, the administrators of the bank utilized the
                            circumstances to do business and to secure profits to its
                            shareholders.</p>
                        <p>What we do condemn is that Governmental apathy which allowed the events
                            to run without even comprehending what was occurring, resulting in the
                            end in an insupportable charge upon the Cuban treasury and a
                            considerable relief for the bank.</p>
                        <p>It is not strange therefore that reforms have become necessary to raise
                            the Island of Cuba from its prostration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: By reference to the files of the
                            ministry of state your excellency will note that for several years past
                            the Government of the United States has been earnestly remonstrating
                            against the system of the Spanish Government of levying and collecting
                            in the ports of the United States an export tax or duty, styled consular
                            tonnage dues, and which has been the source of much complaint on the
                            part of American shippers. One form of that tax was the collection of 40
                            cents per head upon cattle shipped to Cuba, and as this had come to be a
                            considerable export trade from the States in the Gulf of Mexico the tax
                            proved onerous and led to vigorous protests. About two years ago these
                            protests were formulated in a note of this legation, dated September 26,
                            1882, in which the claim of Mr. D. James McKay was presented to His
                            Catholic Majesty’s Government for the return of several thousand dollars
                            of these unwarranted taxes. The reply of your excellency’s Government
                            was that no law or regulation had existed since 1876 which authorized
                            Spanish consuls to collect the particular tax complained of, and that
                            instructions would be sent to those officials to desist from its
                            collection in future; but no answer was made to the demand for the
                            return of the taxes acknowledged to have been illegally exacted.</p>
                        <p>It therefore became my duty on the 16th of July, 1883, under specific
                            instructions of my Government, to direct the attention of the then
                            minister of state to this omission, and to repeat the request for the
                            return of the confessedly illegal taxes exacted by the Spanish consuls.
                            As three months passed by without any reference to my note, I was
                            instructed to again repeat the demand for payment, and to urge a prompt
                            return of the money. This last note was followed up by personal
                            reference to the subject on my part to your excellency’s predecessor,
                            and finally, under date of January 12 last, a note was received from
                            him, in which I was informed that instructions would be sent to the
                            consul at Key West (where the greater amount of the taxes had been
                            collected) to make a liquidation of the sums which had been wrongfully
                            received in order to return the same to the interested parties.</p>
                        <p>This tardy but gratifying resolution was communicated, through the
                            Department of State at, Washington to the claimants, who sought for the
                            repayment of their money from the Spanish consul at Key West; but that
                            official persists in disobeying the orders of the Government at Madrid,
                            if they have been sent to him, as he neglects to make the promised
                            repayment. Despairing of a settlement through the consulate where the
                            wrongful and illegal taxes were exacted, the claimants have presented
                            their itemized accounts in due form to the Department of State at
                            Washington, and these have been forwarded to me by my Government. And,
                            in obedience to its instructions, I have to again present a demand for
                            the return of the taxes which the Spanish Government has acknowledged to
                            have been collected without warrant of law or regulation, to ask that
                            the payment be made to this legation, and to express the hope cherished
                            by my Government that no further delay will occur in repairing the wrong
                            inflicted on American shippers. Your excellency will, I am sure,
                            recognize that my Government has just cause of complaint at the past
                            delays, when you remember how vigorously it has resisted the pretensions
                            of the Spanish Government to collect an export duty in American ports,
                            and when this portion of the duty at least has been <pb n="501"
                                xml:id="pg_501" facs="0601"/>acknowledged by the latter to be
                            unwarranted and illegal, and I am convinced that you will allow no
                            further impediments to be interposed to its prompt return.</p>
                        <p>I beg to add that I will cheerfully hold myself ready to meet any
                            official your excellency may see proper to designate to adjust the
                            accounts of the several claimants; or, should it be preferred to send me
                            a copy of any liquidation made by the consul at Key West, I will
                            promptly compare it with the accounts on file in the legation, and
                            advise your excellency of the result without delay.</p>

                            to the representations made by the Government of the United States

                            tonnage lees. I had the honor to inform your excellency in regard to
                            this matter on the 12th January last that instructions had been sent to
                            the Spanish consul at Key West, at which port the greater part of the
                            said tax had been collected, to make a liquidation of the sums which
                            might result as having been unjustly received in order to return the
                            same to the interested parties. As up to date the reply of the said
                            consul has not been received in this ministry, and without the data

                        <p>The undersigned, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of His
                            Majesty the King of Spain, has the honor to address the honorable
                            Secretary of State of the United States for the purpose of bringing some
                            matters to his notice for which this Government is doubtless not
                            responsible, and which it is, perhaps, disposed to prevent, as far as
                            possible, in order to show that it fully reciprocates the sincere
                            friendship which is entertained for it by both my Government and my
                            nation.</p>
                        <p>Owing to the noble hospitality which is offered to all men by this great
                            Republic, and to the great degree of freedom that is here enjoyed, a
                            certain turbulent minority of Spaniards, born in Cuba, take refuge in
                            this country for the purpose of conspiring, without molestation; they
                            insult their mother country and its most venerable institutions, and
                            they proclaim war to the knife against Spain in public meetings and
                            printed papers of all kinds.</p>
                        <p>They now call the war which they propose to wage a scientific war, that
                            is, a war in which dynamite is to be used, together with other
                            inventions for blowing up barracks, destroying vessels, and demolishing
                            whole cities with their inhabitants. Any one taking a charitable view of
                            these projects would be inclined to regard such talk and such threats as
                            ridiculous bluster; yet the encomiums passed on wholesale murder,
                            accomplished through treachery, and the open incitements thereto which
                            are uttered so freely, are repugnant to the moral sense of all
                            right-minded persons.</p>
                        <p>The Cuban revolutionists assert, in their newspapers, that they already
                            have in their possession all the means that they require for the
                            prosecution of this scientific war, and that they are preparing to use
                            them; they have a Russian professor of that science, who is known as
                            Dr.—, and who, it appears, gives them public instructions; they, in
                            their turn, feeling grateful for his services, regard him as a public
                            benefactor, and place him in the same category with Gutenberg and
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>They say that a single Cuban revolutionist, having been properly
                            instructed by the learned Russian, can blow up one or two thousand
                            Spanish soldiers quite conveniently and cheaply, and almost without
                            danger.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned takes the liberty to send the honorable Secretary of
                            State two newspapers, published at Key West, in which he will find
                            stated at length what is here summarized.</p>
                        <p>This conduct of the Cuban refugees would be the more odious (if it were
                            not so grotesque) inasmuch as recently, on the occasion of Agüero’s
                            discharge from custody, the mayor, the lieutenant-governor of the state,
                            and the collector of customs took part in the triumph, during which the
                            grossest insults and the most savage threats were uttered, both in
                            speeches and in yells, against my country and my Government.</p>

                        <p>The undersigned, who has come to this glorious and flourishing
                            confederation full of sympathy with the well-concerted organism that
                            constitutes its greatness, and of admiration for its growing and
                            extraordinary prosperity, is ashamed of his degenerate countrymen who
                            find refuge here, perhaps doing us some material injury, but abusing the
                            freedom which they meet with among a noble people, and showing
                            themselves to be unworthy of that freedom upon which they are trying to
                            cast a dark blot; to which condition of things it is to be hoped that
                            the honorable Secretary of State, with the means which are at the
                            disposal of the Attorney-General, will apply a remedy.</p>

                            request made by the Spanish consul at Baltimore to be furnished by the
                            collector of customs at that port with periodical certificates of the
                            cargoes of sugar, molasses, and tobacco imported from Cuba and Porto
                            Rico, giving the name and flag of the vessel, date of entry, port of
                            clearance, number and description of packages, and weight in American
                            pounds, &amp;c. This request of Mr. Navarro, the consul, would appear to
                            have been made under a misapprehension of the purport and scope of the
                            third article of the agreement signed at Madrid, February 13, 1884. Such
                            a request has not been made, so far as known, by any other consular
                            officer of Spain in the United States.</p>
                        <p>From the reply made to Mr. Folger’s inquiry it will be seen that this
                            Government construes the engagement in accordance with its evident
                            intent, and will require its customs officers to give to any Spanish
                            consul, whenever he may request it, a certificate in respect to the
                            cargo of sugar or tobacco brought by any designated vessel to our ports.
                            Although molasses is not mentioned in the agreement, it may be deemed
                            comprised under the general phrase “sugar.”</p>
                        <p>It is, of course, evident that the agreement could not have contemplated
                            requiring our customs administration to prepare, for the information of
                            the Spanish consuls detailed periodical statements of every package of
                            the articles in question brought to the United States from the Antilles.
                            Besides entailing an amount of labor not necessary to compliance with
                            the agreement and which this Government, even in the interest of its own
                            revenues, could not well ask of any foreign Government under like
                            circumstances, there is involved a question of responsibility which
                            appears to be decisive. There is the distinction between courteously
                            furnishing specific information where it may be needed and requested and
                            an obligation to make a comprehensive and exact return, omitting not
                            even isolated packages found in a general cargo, or entered by
                            passengers as personal effects.</p>

                            Majesty the King of Spain, would not again trouble the honorable
                            Secretary of State about the threats of sending armed expeditions to
                            Cuba, which are constantly made by Spanish newspapers published in this
                            Republic, especially in New York and Key West, if these threats <pb
                                n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0605"/>were not made simultaneously
                            with advices received by him to the effect that Carlos Agüero is
                            organizing an expedition at Key West; he has a force of one hundred
                            armed men, together with bomb shells and other destructive materials,
                            which are to be used against us.</p>
                        <p>Although public feeling in the island of Cuba is not now favorable to
                            another civil war, yet, if Aguero were to, land in Cuba, he might
                            plunder and rob as he has done before; and, if he should sail from a
                            port of this country, and be captured before he effected a landing, the
                            Cuban authorities would be obliged to inflict a very severe punishment
                            upon him and his companions.</p>
                        <p>At all events, Agüero’s expedition, just like any other organized by
                            Cuban refugees, might, if it should sail from an American port, give
                            rise to much unpleasantness. The undersigned therefore thinks that he is
                            performing an imperative duty in advising Mr. Frelinghuysen of the
                            design which it is apparently sought to accomplish, in order that, so
                            far as this may be allowed by the means at the disposal of this
                            Government, the evil maybe prevented, and that no conspiracy and the
                            accomplishment of no plan may be permitted in this country for the
                            disturbance of the public peace within the territory of a friendly

                            dispatches which he has just received from the Spanish consul at Key

                            their sympathizers is so great that it appears that an attempt against
                            the life of that consular representative is imminent.</p>
                        <p>The honorable Secretary of State will not fail to perceive the grave

                            in the name of international law, and of the good friendship which
                            exists between the Government of the Union and that of His Majesty the
                            King, he begs that he will be pleased to cause such measures as may be
                            within reach to be immediately taken to insure the personal safety of
                            the Spanish agent at Key West, and to ward off any criminal attempt
                            directed against that officer.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned trusts to the efficacious and energetic attitude which
                            the United States will doubtless adopt in the present circumstances, and
                            improves the opportunity, &amp;c.</p>

                            that they may be used for fresh expeditions against Cuba. He thinks it

                            State, and he hopes that the shipment of these articles, which are
                            contraband of war, to the dominions of Spain, will be prevented by all
                            the means at the disposal of this Government, and that those who are

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the note you were pleased to
                            address on the 17th ultimo, in relation to the alleged designs of
                            persons in the United States against life and property in the island of
                            Cuba, and to my acknowledgment thereof, under date of the 26th ultimo, I
                            have now the honor to inform you of the purport of the reply I have
                            received from the Attorney-General, to whom your note was referred for
                            the expression of his views.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Brewster adverts to your remark that “it is to be hoped that the
                            honorable Secretary of State, with the means which are at the disposal
                            of the Attorney-General, will apply a remedy”; and observes that he does
                            not see what remedy the statutes of this country afford for checking
                            violations of the neutrality laws of the character alluded to in your
                            note, beyond those to which the Department of Justice had already called
                            the attention of the officers of that Department, in the general
                            circular of March 12 ultimo. Inasmuch as that notice regarding the
                            shipment of dangerous explosives is not confined to any one particular
                            nation, or to any one particular foreign port, and is wholly general in
                            its character, it is thought that any specific acts of an overt nature,
                            of which the Spanish Government could have just cause to complain, may,
                            in virtue of that circular, be brought within the cognizance of the
                            officers of the Department of Justice.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to inclose a copy of Attorney-General Brewster’s
                            circular for your information.</p>
                        <p>Permit me to add that I shall much regret if our existing laws are found
                            not to furnish the adequate means of preventing evil disposed persons
                            from committing, within our territory, acts repugnant to the sense of
                            right and justice of the people of the United States, who have on no
                            occasion omitted to testify their abhorrence of such criminal
                            designs.</p>

                                that certain persons are aiding in the prosecution of heinous crimes
                                by shipping to foreign ports explosives dangerous in the highest
                                degree to life and property. No proof has been adduced that this
                                rumor is founded upon fact, and the President cannot believe its
                                truth. The honor of this nation, however, requires that it should
                                not be open to the imputation, unfounded though it be, of the
                                slightest appearance of tolerating such crimes, whether to be
                                committed against our people or those of other countries.</p>

                                regulate the shipment of explosives, and the punishment of those who
                                infringe their provisions, and you are instructed to be diligent in
                                your efforts to prevent the offenses described, and to detect and
                                prosecute those who have committed them or who may commit them.</p>

                            subject of reported plots in this country against the peace of Cuba, I
                            have the honor to say that I have received a letter from the Attorney
                            General of late date <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0612"/>which
                            makes it apparent that his Department encounters peculiar difficulties
                            in the investigations it is pursuing into the particulars of the
                            enterprises which are alleged to foe on foot harboring enmity to the
                            peace of Cuba, from the circumstance that the statements of the Spanish
                            consuls transmitted hither fail to specify any tangible facts. The
                            consul at Key West, for example, furnishes our officers with the simple
                            fact that Cubans had been seen hauling barrels and boxes eastward, but
                            will not state confidentially “the house from which this hauling was
                            observed, the road, nor distance from the wharf”; nor will he place his
                            detectives in communication with those of the United States.</p>

                            after sunset, with a few men in a small boat, and that he (the agent)
                            had sent the Dix, by anticipation, at midday to intercept him and to
                            watch suspected points, and that a naval detachment followed at 11
                            o’clock; also, that, according to the Spanish consul, who desired this
                            information to be sent to His Majesty’s legation here, still another
                            expedition is nearly ready to start.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my note to you of yesterday’s
                            date, concerning the reports of intended mob-violence against the
                            Spanish consul at Key West on the part of Cubans resident there, I have
                            now the honor to inform you that careful investigation by the naval and
                            civil authorities there affords the gratifying assurance that the report
                            is exaggerated. The rumor would appear to have originated in a threat,
                            uttered in a grog-shop on Thursday night, to tar and feather the consul,
                            but this idle and probably drunken menace appears to have passed without
                            any result whatever.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the commander of the Galena at Key West has renewed to the
                            Spanish consul the offer made to him last week to place a guard of
                            marines to guard the consulate, residence, and person of the consul. The
                            consul, however, declines a guard, but expresses fear of assassination.
                            Arrangements have been made by which he can summon assistance from the
                            naval vessels by signal at any hour.</p>
                        <p>The most adequate precaution against the personal attempts which the
                            consul would seem to apprehend appears to lie in the protective guard
                            which he has declined. This Government cannot, of course, undertake to
                            place a foreign officer under military surveillance of any kind without
                            his consent or the consent of his Government, and I have accordingly the
                            honor to request that you will advise me whether it is your wish that
                            the consul should be personally guarded. If this be desired this
                            Government will endeavor to do so.</p>

                            suggestion made to me by the Attorney General in view of the
                            investigation now in progress at New York touching the alleged
                            fabrication of dynamite there in aid of revolutionary enterprises
                            directed against Cuba. The United States attorney at New York, Mr. Elihu
                            Root, intimates that his investigation might be much facilitated were he
                            authorized to communicate directly with the consul-general of Spain in
                            that city, informing him of the nature of the instructions under which
                            he is acting and receiving from the consul-general the specific
                            information which the consul may possess or be able to obtain as to the
                            alleged preparations.</p>
                        <p>I have requested Mr. Brewster to so instruct Mr. Root, and I have the
                            honor to inform you of this action, to the end that you may, if
                            necessary, authorize and direct the consul general at New York to
                            frankly communicate to the United States attorney whatever information
                            he may possess tending to subserve the ends of justice in this

                        <p>The undersigned, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of His
                            Majesty the King of Spain, has the honor to state to the honorable
                            Secretary of State of the United States that he has received his note of
                            the 17th instant, informing him that the rumor which had been spread
                            that a mob was about to arise and was on the point of committing violent
                            acts against the consul of Spain at Key West, had been exaggerated.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned has received this information with satisfaction, and is
                            thankful for the offer which, in the name of the Government of the
                            United States, has been made to him by the Hon. Frederick T.
                            Frelinghuysen, to protect the security of the consul with a military
                            guard, but, it not being possible for him to know the situation in Key
                            West, he cannot advise, as the Secretary of State asks him to do,
                            whether the guard which the consul has declined should be set. That
                            officer is the sole judge in the matter, and in the fulfillment, of his
                            duty he exposes himself to the risk of some evil disposed persons taking
                            his life, as has so often occurred in past times, without the dignity of
                            Kings or of Presidents being sufficient to save them.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned knows very well that all the good will of the Government
                                <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0615"/>of the United States could
                            not prevent such a thing from happening, but what he believes should be
                            prevented, perhaps, is the occurrence of that which the laws of the
                            United States do not tolerate, and which every cultured people seeks to
                            prevent, however ample and universal may be the liberty which its
                            citizens enjoy, and that is that daily and hourly in the street, in
                            cafes and taverns, in newspapers and broadsides, a functionary of a
                            friendly nation should be threatened, insulted, and disparaged, whether
                            those who proffer such threats, insults, and outrages be drunken or
                            not.</p>
                        <p>In Key West, as the undersigned opines, the object is now not to prevent
                            but suppress and punish constant infractions of the laws, and he
                            believes that if the zeal of the judicial officers of the United States,
                            freshly invoked by the Federal Government, could succeed in imposing the
                            punishment which is merited upon a few of the many criminals there
                            sheltered, much would be accomplished towards calming the alarm which
                            exists, and towards removing the opportunity for events which both
                            Governments would regret.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have had the honor to receive your note
                            of the 19th ultimo relative to present events at Key West, and in
                            especial answer to my note to you of the 17th ultimo.</p>
                        <p>As your note leaves open the question whether the guard, with which this
                            Government offered to protect the Spanish consul at Key West, and which
                            that officer declined, should be placed for his protection,
                            notwithstanding such declension, the suggested precaution will not be
                            taken, but, as my note of the 17th informed you, the naval commander
                            holds himself ready to respond, on signal, to any request which the
                            consul may make for protection.</p>
                        <p>This, I believe, sufficiently defines whatever responsibilities the
                            situation at Key West may imply with respect to the personal safety of
                            the consul.</p>
                        <p>As to the other point in your note, let me say that when we are doing all
                            we can to fulfill our obligation to Spain, you ask us to do that which
                            the executive of no nation can do.</p>
                        <p>Threats of personal injury may, at times, take such direct form as to
                            come within the cognizance of the courts, but action thereon is a
                            judicial function, which may not be exercised by the executive.</p>

                            the interview had with him on Saturday last, he has telegraphed to the
                            Spanish consul at Key West enjoining upon him extreme prudence in order
                            to avoid pretexts of conflict, and ordering him in case his life be

                            United States by land or sea, even if there should be a Spanish
                            man-of-war in the harbor, since the undersigned desires, and he believes
                            that with this desire he interprets that of the Secretary of State, that
                            the good harmony of the two Governments be clearly shown, and that even
                            the most distant pretext be not given” for saying that in a port of the
                            United States the consul of a friendly nation has been protected Thy a
                            foreign force.</p>
                        <p>The Spanish consul at Key West has answered the undersigned’s telegram
                            that he has not given and will not give any pretext for the disturbance
                            of peace in that island, but that the Cubans there, dissatisfied by his
                            extreme vigilance, are endeavoring at all hazards to procure his removal
                            from his post, where he has lent signal service to the Government of the
                            King of Spain.</p>
                        <p>The consul also states that some of the authorities of the State of
                            Florida, being desirous of attracting the Cubans in order to gain their
                            votes, are temporizing with those who by their insults and ridicule seek
                            to make the consul’s residence intolerable.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned, who has received so many proofs of the good wishes of
                            the honorable Secretary of State, and who feels grateful for the
                            repeated efforts of the Government of the United States to protect the
                            security of the Spanish consul and to cause the neutrality laws to be
                            obeyed, deems it his duty to bring the foregoing facts to Mr.
                            Frelinghuysen’s knowledge, to the end that by means of the agents which
                            the Federal Government has in Florida he may endeavor to investigate the
                            truth thereof, and be pleased in view thereof to give such orders as he

                            reports furnished by the consul of Spain at Savannah, Ga., to the effect
                            that the Cuban filibusters have established deposits of arms, munitions,

                            consequence of this information you request that the Government of the
                            United States take appropriate steps, if possible, to discover the

                            direction. To this end I communicate copies of your note to the
                            Secretaries of the Navy and of the Treasury and to the Attorney-General
                            for such action as may be feasible.</p>

                            distant from those indicated, lacks the essential quality of
                            definiteness, and would appear to embody the substance of floating
                            rumors which have reached the Spanish consul at Savannah. Let me add
                            that it seems not to have occurred to you that the rumored deposit at
                            Turk’s Islands is not within the competence of this Government to
                            investigate, those islands being possessions of the British crown.</p>

                            they are now stationed.</p>
                        <p>Commander Batchellor reports that all is quiet that he apprehends no
                            danger to any person, and has no reason to believe that an attempt will
                            be made from Key West to violate the neutrality laws.</p>

                            confine myself to repeating to the Government of the Union my warmest

                                United States district court for this district commenced its regular
                                session here on the 16th ultimo, and on the 17th I brought to a
                                hearing the case of The United States <hi rend="italic">versus</hi>
                                The Schooner Shavers, against which I had filed two “libels of
                                information” for forfeiture; one for forfeiture under the neutrality
                                laws, Section 5288 Revised Statutes, the other for proceeding on a
                                “foreign voyage” in violation of Section 4337 Revised Statutes; on
                                the 19th concluded the hearing, and on the 5th of July the district
                                judge (Locke) decreed the schooner forfeited to the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>On the second day of the term I also filed, by leave of court,
                                information (criminal) against Emilio Diaz and Patrick Berry, who
                                had previously been arrested on the return here of the schooner
                                Shavers, from Cuba, and had a hearing before the United States
                                commissioner, and Berry held under bond for trial, and Diaz
                                discharged. I found out that he was the one who prepared the means
                                of the Aguero expedition, hired the vessel, and managed the whole
                                business.</p>
                            <p>I also had one Bruno Alphonzo arrested on the 17th ultimo, having
                                evidence of his having been one of the Aguero expedition, and had
                                returned to this place from Cuba disguised.</p>
                            <p>Patrick Berry having failed to appear, an <hi rend="italic">alias
                                    capias</hi> was issued, and judgment entered against his
                                bondsmen for $529.69, amount of bond and costs, and on the 5th
                                instant the amount was collected and paid into the registry of the
                                court.</p>
                            <p>On the 1st instant Emilio Diaz was tried and convicted, and on the
                                5th was sentenced by the court to pay a fine of $500 and be
                                imprisoned for a period of eight months. On the 1st instant Clinton
                                Shavers, the owner of the schooner Shavers, was indicted, by the
                                grand jury for violating the neutrality laws, and arrested and
                                placed under bonds, and upon the case being called for trial it was
                                continued, on motion of the defendant’s attorney, by order of the
                                court.</p>
                            <p>On the same day the grand jury indicted Carlos Aguero, the commander
                                of the expedition, and I had a <hi rend="italic">capias</hi> issued
                                and placed it in the hands of the marshal, instructing him to hold
                                it and to arrest Aguero if he should return within this
                                district.</p>
                            <p>Case of Bruno Alphonzo was continued, and he placed under bonds.</p>
                            <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0620"/>
                            <p>The forfeiture of the schooner Shavers and the arrest of her owner,
                                and the conviction of Diaz, the manager of the Agüero expedition,
                                and the activity and vigilance of the officers here have thoroughly
                                convinced these people of the earnestness of the Government to
                                enforce its neutrality laws, and I feel fully satisfied that there
                                will be no further attempts in this district to organize expeditions
                                in the interest of the Cuban revolutionists, at least for some time
                                to come.</p>

                            conspiring in New York against Cuba and propose to make a turbulent
                            manifestation against Spain on the 10th instant. Your confidence that
                            the United States will employ all proper measures in this country to
                            frustrate the designs of those who would disturb the public peace of
                            Spain is not misplaced.</p>
                        <p>If the “turbulent manifestation” anticipated should be a breach of the
                            peace here, it will be checked by the local authorities. If it should
                            prove to be only the gasconade of discontents it would be unwise to
                            dignify it by official notice even if our laws afforded a censorship of
                            mere speech.</p>
                        <p>At the same time the proceedings of any manifestation thought to be
                            against the peace of Spain will be carefully watched as such proceedings
                            may indicate contemplated overt acts unfriendly to Spain, which acts
                            will be promptly suppressed, as the past action of this Government I am
                            satisfied fully assures you.</p>
                        <p>By reason of the brevity of the notice you were able to give of the
                            anticipated manifestation its true character cannot be more accurately
                            conjectured than is herein indicated.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to state that the 6th of
                        November was celebrated in Sweden as a festival.</p>
                    <p>The day is the anniversary of the victory and death of the great Gustavus
                        Adolphus at Lützen, and the Swedes love to do honor to the memory of their
                        great King, “the Lion of the North,” whose “sword was mighty as the pen of
                        Luther.”</p>
                    <p>On the evening of the 6th at Stockholm, the entire space around Ridderholms
                        church, the Westminster of Sweden, was filled with a vast multitude of
                        people, a selected choir of two hundred voices marched with banners to the
                        outer walls of the church, and halting just outside the mausoleum of
                        Gustavus sang paeans to his memory.</p>
                    <p>Other choirs sang around the bronze equestrian statue of the heroic King,
                        which rises from the center of the square that bears his name.</p>
                    <p>“Long live the memory of Gustavus Adolphus!” cried the choir as the song died
                        away on the evening air, and the great throng of many thousands responded
                        with four royal cheers.</p>
                    <p>On the morning of the 6th of November the American flag was run up at this
                        legation in honor of the great Gustavus of Sweden. This is the first time I
                        have hoisted our flag in Scandinavia. I did this with some little
                        hesitation, for foreign ministers at this capital have not been accustomed
                        to display the flag of their country. Indeed, I have failed to learn that
                        they have ever done so. I believed, however, that this was “a custom more
                        honored in the breach than the observance,” and that the flag of a free
                        people might well be flung to the breeze in honor of the greatest warrior in
                        the cause of religious freedom; that the flag of America might well wave at
                        the festival in commemoration of the Swedish King who founded the first
                        Swedish colony within the limits of the United States. And so the beautiful
                        new flag, just sent me by the Department, was run out from the American
                        legation over the spacious King’s Park, where it was seen from every part of
                        the great promenade of Stockholm, across the harbor to the palace, and from
                        beyond North bridge and Wasa bridge far out on the Mælar Lake. It was the
                        Only flag displayed by the representative of any foreign country at
                        Stockholm.</p>
                    <p>This American tribute to Sweden is deeply appreciated by the Swedes, and was
                        received by them with touching expressions of gratitude. The Swedish
                        newspapers very generally speak of this tribute and always in thankful
                        recognition thereof.’ The Nya Dagligt Allehanda and the Aftonbladet, the two
                        evening papers of Stockholm, and the Handels Sidning, the chief newspaper of
                        Gothenburg, make this hoisting of the American flag the subject of special
                        editorials.</p>
                    <p>The following is a translation of the editorial in the Nya Dagligt Allehanda,
                        the evening paper of the largest circulation in Stockholm: <quote

                                Ridderholms church, and at the statue of the hero King on the square
                                of Gustavus Adolphus. An especial tribute, beautiful but simple, and
                                unostentatious, as becomes that land, the United <pb n="523"

                                minister this tribute has to-day been paid, deserves a grateful
                                mention. Minister Thomas has to-day, from the balcony of his
                                residence on the King’s Park, hoisted the starry banner of
                                America.</p>
                            <p>This Swedish-loving American, who, during a long sojourn in Sweden as
                                consul for his native land, has learned to know and to appreciate
                                our land and its people, has today, <hi rend="italic">for the first
                                    time</hi>, hoisted the American flag, not to celebrate any
                                holiday of his own country, but to do honor to the memory of the
                                greatest among warriors for religious liberty. By this act Mr.
                                Thomas also honors the founder of the first New Sweden in America,
                                the Swedish colony on the Delaware, which, as is well known, was

                        (Received December 17.)</dateline></opener>
                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to address the Department of
                        State on the subject of direct steam communication between Sweden and the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>The traveler from the United States to Sweden usually takes one of the great
                        transatlantic steamers from America to Liverpool, thence a few hours by rail
                        carries him across the country to Hull on the east coast of England.
                        Embarking here a voyage of two days carries the traveler over the stormy
                        North Sea, past the Skaw on the northern sandy point of Denmark, and into
                        the port of Gothenburg, Sweden.</p>
                    <p>One may also leave America by the German Atlantic steamers, and, landing at
                        Bremen or Hamburg, keep on by rail and boat to Copenhagen, whence a steamer
                        will take him across the sound to Malmö, Sweden, in less than two hours.</p>
                    <p>Some four years ago the Danish Thingvalla Steamship Company was founded; this
                        line plies once a fortnight between Copenhagen and New York. One may now
                        therefore sail from New York to Copenhagen direct, and then changing steamer
                        and crossing the-sound arrive at Malmö, Sweden.</p>
                    <p>The great bulk of the traffic between Sweden and America passes over the
                        first-mentioned route, to wit, from Gothenburg, Sweden, across the North
                        Sea, to Hull, England, thence by rail to Liverpool, thence by steamship to
                        America. In fact more than nine-tenths of the emigrants from Sweden to the
                        United States take this route.</p>
                    <p>Each of these lines has its peculiar advantages, but they all have this one
                        great disadvantage in common: that goods sent from America to Sweden must be
                        discharged and re-loaded at a foreign port <hi rend="italic">en route</hi>,
                        with all the delays, breakages, damages, agencies, custom-house supervision,
                        and annoyances which such transshipment is sure to occasion.</p>
                    <p>Of course, the same is equally true of goods sent from Sweden to America, and
                        passengers and immigrants from either country to the other, together with
                        all their baggage, must likewise be transshipped.</p>
                    <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0624"/>
                    <p>Yet spite of all hindrances and inconveniences the commerce between the
                        United States and Sweden has attained large and ever-increasing
                        proportions.</p>
                    <p>The United States export to Sweden large quantities of pork, lard, cotton,
                        petroleum, rosin, maize, tools, sewing-machines, and Yankee notions, and
                        some cheese, wheat, and black-walnut timber; while Sweden sends to the
                        United States thousands of honest, industrious emigrants, and thousands of
                        tons of iron every year. Since last July, there has been, also, an active
                        shipment of matches from Sweden to our country.</p>
                    <p>Of pork alone (chiefly sides) the yearly export from the United States to
                        Sweden may be reckoned at from 40,000 to 60,000 boxes, or 10,000 to 15,000
                        tons; while Sweden sends to the American Union every year about 60,000 tons
                        of iron.</p>
                    <p>Of emigrants, there sailed from the port of Gothenburg, Sweden, for the
                        United States, in round numbers, in 1881, 30,000; in 1882, 40,000; in the
                        present year, 1883, the number will reach 25,000, notwithstanding the hard
                        times and the consequent difficulty of obtaining employment in the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>Here then is a grand commerce, sufficient to handsomely support a weekly line
                        of steamships, yet no steamer plies between the two countries. Furthermore,
                        it is perfectly evident that the present extensive traffic must be
                        materially increased by direct steam communication. Indeed it can never
                        reach anything near its full fruition without this.</p>
                    <p>As long ago as 1863, 1864, and 1865, while I was stationed at Gothenburg as
                        consul for the United States, the subject of a line of steamers from
                        Gothenburg to New York demanded and received much of my attention and
                        effort, and I remember with pleasure that one of the Gothenburg merchants
                        who was most impressed with the practicability and importance of the matter
                        was Mr. Adolf Meyer.</p>
                    <p>On my return to Sweden in August last in the service of the United States, I
                        found that my old friend, Mr. Meyer, had not lost his interest in this
                        subject, and that during all the intervening time, more especially during
                        the last ten years, he had been actively at work endeavoring to form a
                        company and raise the necessary funds to establish a Swedish steamship line
                        between Gothenburg and New York.</p>
                    <p>He had prepared tables by which it was clearly proved that there was already
                        more than sufficient business between the two ports to keep four steamships
                        constantly and remuneratively employed. Yet, despite this, and Mr. Meyer’s
                        own very influential position among the business men of Sweden, he had not
                        succeeded in getting the necessary capital subscribed.</p>
                    <p>One cause which no doubt operated largely against the enterprise was the
                        Swedish emigrant law of 1869, by the provisions of which 50 per cent, more
                        space on ship board was required for each emigrant than is exacted by the
                        laws of England or the United States. A steamer, therefore, that sailing
                        from England could take on board nine hundred emigrants, in sailing from
                        Sweden could take but six hundred, and thus the receipts of the Swedish ship
                        from emigrants would be diminished cue third, a very important
                        consideration.</p>
                    <p>This great obstacle however, is now happily removed. The King, by a royal
                        order of the 2d of March of this year, 1883, has so modified the Swedish
                        emigrant laws that they conform to the laws of the United States in respect
                        to the space to be accorded to each emigrant, so that <pb n="525"
                            xml:id="pg_525" facs="0625"/>now a ship may sail from Sweden with as
                        many emigrants on board as she would be allowed if she sailed from England
                        or Germany.</p>
                    <p>During the past three months the project has advanced with rapid strides.
                        Failing to get the requisite capital for a steamship line subscribed in
                        Sweden, Mr. Meyer turned to the North German Lloyds of Bremen. After
                        extensive and minute negotiations, Mr. Meyer has been successful, and I have
                        the honor and pleasure to announce that a contract has been made. * * *</p>
                    <p>The line will at first consist of but two steamships, the Baltimore and
                        Berlin, which will make monthly trips between New York and Gothenburg,
                        performing the voyage in fourteen or fifteen days. * * *</p>
                    <p>It is believed that the line thus inaugurated will be permanent, that new
                        ships will be added, and that at no distant date fortnightly and then weekly
                        steamers will ply across the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, facilitating
                        and increasing trade, commerce, and immigration.</p>
                    <p>This line is, of course, owned in Germany, but the project of a line to be
                        owned in Sweden has not been abandoned. Subscription papers are being
                        circulated by respected and efficient merchants in Stockholm and Gothenburg,
                        who are hopeful of obtaining the sum of $533,000, which will be sufficient
                        to purchase two steamers of 3,000 tons burden each, whose trips will
                        alternate with those of the ships of the North German Lloyds, and together
                        with them form a fortnightly line.</p>
                    <p>It is intended that the Swedish-owned ships shall sail from Stockholm, thence
                        coasting around the southern end of the Swedish peninsula they will touch at
                        Malmö and Gothenburg, whence they will sail direct for New York, passing to
                        the north of Scotland. Returning, they will steam directly to Gothenburg,
                        and then keep on to Malmö and Stockholm.</p>
                    <p>But whether this latter line be put in operation or not the most important
                        fact remains. * * *</p>
                    <p>Next spring for the first time the American exporter may ship his goods on
                        board a steamer at New York, and have them carried by that steamer directly
                        to Sweden without transshipment. Next spring the thousands of Swedish
                        emigrants may go on board a steamer in a harbor of their own country and in
                        this steamer sail directly to America.</p>
                    <p>This direct communication must naturally and inevitably increase the export
                        of American products to Sweden.</p>
                    <p>In this connection I would call particular attention to Sweden as furnishing
                        a market for American wheat. The consumption of wheat is increasing in
                        Sweden, and as a large portion of this country is too far north for its
                        profitable production, it is imported in increasing quantities. In 1882 the
                        wheat import of Sweden reached a value of more than $2,000,000.</p>
                    <p>An inconsiderable fraction of this came from the United States, but the great
                        bulk thereof was imported from Denmark and was the product of Danish
                        soil.</p>
                    <p>With direct steam communication, I am confident that the United States can
                        supply Sweden at a profit with all the wheat she imports.</p>
                    <p>It is with pleasure I write this dispatch, for the assured establishment of
                        direct steam communication between the United States and Sweden is certainly
                        a just cause of congratulation in both countries.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my dispatch No. 29 I had the honor to
                        address you on the subject of direct steam communication between Sweden and
                        the United States. I took occasion in that dispatch to speak at length of
                        the amount and importance of the commerce between the two countries, and the
                        large emigration from Sweden to the United States, and to announce that
                        direct steam communication between Sweden and America would be inaugurated
                        in 1884 by steamers of the North German Lloyds, which would ply once a month
                        between Gothenburg and New York, the pioneer steamer leaving Gothenburg on
                        April 24.</p>
                    <p>I have now the honor to inform you that a second line of steamships between
                        the United States and Sweden will be put in operation in 1884. The name of
                        the new company is the Direct Swedish Steamship Line. It will at first be
                        composed of three steamers of about 3,500 tons capacity each, named,
                        respectively, Lincoln City, Stockholm City, and Gothenburg City.</p>
                    <p>These are iron screw steamships, entirely new, and now being fitted up in
                        England. They are first-class vessels, and rated 100 A 1 at Lloyds. They
                        will contain commodious quarters for emigrants, and also accommodations for
                        a limited number of first and second class passengers. The hull of each ship
                        will be divided into eight compartments suitable for carrying grain in
                        bulk.</p>
                    <p>These ships will sail from Stockholm, and, coasting around the southern end
                        of the Swedish peninsula, touch at the Swedish ports of Malmö and
                        Gothenburg, whence they will steam direct to America. Their return trips
                        will be to Stockholm, touching at Gothenburg and Malmö if there be freight
                        or passengers for those ports.</p>
                    <p>The vessels of this line will sail about once in three weeks between the two
                        countries. The first ship will depart from Stockholm about the middle of
                        April, 1884, for the port of New York. The second ship will sail for Boston,
                        the third for New York, and so on, the steamers making alternate trips to
                        New York and Boston.</p>
                    <p>This line is owned in England, but it will be managed on this side the
                        Atlantic by the energetic and honorable firm of Olsen &amp; Wright,
                        Stockholm. The agents in New York will be Messrs. Simpson, Spence &amp; Co.,
                        and in Boston, Messrs. J. B. Brigham &amp; Co.</p>
                    <p>I desire to call the attention of American exporters to the facilities
                        afforded by this Stockholm line, as well as by the Gothenburg line,
                        mentioned in my dispatch No. 29, for increasing the volume and variety of
                        American exports to Sweden, and more especially the export of grain and
                        flour, agricultural machinery, and bulky articles, and fruit, and other
                        perishable goods.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Grain.</hi>—The unavoidable necessity of transshipping all
                        grain in a foreign port has hitherto prevented the shipment of grain from
                        America to Sweden by any of the regular lines; An occasional cargo, however,
                        has been exported by sailing vessels. But the cargo of grain carried by
                        vessels suited to the North Atlantic trade amounts to from 5,000 to 8,000
                        quarters. This amount is too large to be economically handled by any one
                        Swedish merchant at one time.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Wheat.</hi>—Again, the flour-mills of Sweden are of limited
                        capacity, and none of them can advantageously receive a whole cargo of wheat
                        at <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0627"/>once. The result is that
                        although the wheat import of Sweden for 1882 reached a value of more than
                        $2,000,000, it was nearly all imported from Denmark or Stettin, only an
                        inconsiderable fraction thereof coming from the United States. These direct
                        steamers now offer for the first time a twofold advantage to the American
                        exporter of grain: <list>

                            <item>These direct steamers, being divided into eight compartments, can
                                carry small amounts of grain in bulk—from 1,000 to 3,000 quarters
                                per trip—which amounts can be most economically handled in
                                Sweden.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Maize.</hi>—What is said of wheat is equally true of maize.
                        Maize is now used to a considerable extent in Sweden for feed and in the
                        distilleries. A large amount of maize may be profitably exported from
                        America to Sweden with the opportunity for direct and limited shipments in
                        bulk now offered.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Flour.</hi>—It is my belief that flour in barrels may be
                        successfully shipped to Sweden by the direct steamers.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Agricultural machinery, &amp;c.</hi>—I am convinced that
                        the improved American agricultural machinery could be sold at a profit,
                        especially in the southern provinces of Sweden. Such machinery, and indeed
                        all bulky articles, can, of course, be most conveniently transported by a
                        direct line, the difficulties of transshipment being increased by the bulk
                        of the goods.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Fruit</hi>.—In the winter of 1882–’83 American apples were
                        imported into Sweden in considerable quantities, and met with a ready sale.
                        The Baldwin is the variety preferred here. Of course transshipment, even the
                        most careful, is sure to bruise and injure fruit, and cause its speedier
                        decay. It seems to me, therefore, that direct steamers may bring to Sweden
                        not only apples but some of our more delicate fruits and perishable articles
                        generally, the shipment of which has hitherto been difficult or
                        impracticable.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Canned goods.</hi>—But few of the American canned goods are
                        consumed in Sweden, while large quantities of the French goods are used
                        here. I feel sure that Sweden offers a desirable and extensive market for
                        the sale of American canned fruits, vegetables, lobsters, and oysters.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Yankee notions.</hi>—The thousand and one little articles
                        of daily use and convenience embraced under the prolific appellation of
                        Yankee notions can be sold in Sweden in respectable quantities and at a good
                        profit.</p>
                    <p>To recapitulate, I would call the special attention of American merchants to
                        the advantages, direct steam communication offers for the shipment of— <list>

                        </list></p>
                    <p>In conclusion, I desire to say that I do not believe the well-established
                        Atlantic steamship lines have cause to look with jealousy upon these new
                        direct steamers. The business done by the new ships will be largely such as
                        they themselves create, and such as is not at present, and can never be,
                        advantageously done by the older lines, which must inevitably transship all
                        goods carried by them to and from Sweden. The present Swedish business done
                        by the old lines will quite generally remain to them. It is the increase of
                        business which the direct <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0628"/>steamers
                        will chiefly carry, and of this increase they will themselves be largely the
                        occasion.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that the direct steam communication between Sweden and the
                        United States, which is to be inaugurated in April next, will be permanent,
                        and must of necessity materially increase trade, commerce, and immigration,
                        and at the same time invigorate and strengthen the friendship and good will
                        which have always subsisted between America and Scandinavia.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my dispatch No. 35 on the subject
                        of direct steam communication between the United States and Sweden, I have
                        the honor to inform you that the Stockholm City, the pioneer steamer of the
                        Direct Swedish Steamship Line between Stockholm and the United States,
                        sailed this afternoon at 4 o’clock from Stockholm for Boston.</p>
                    <p>The Stockholm City is an entirely new English-built iron steamship. She
                        carries 3,600 tons heavy goods, or 4,500 tons measured goods, and is
                        permitted to carry, under the laws of Sweden, 840 passengers.</p>
                    <p>She sailed from Stockholm, having on board 1,200 tons freight, chiefly iron,
                        and 5 first-class, 10 second-class, and 114 steerage passengers. She will
                        touch at the Swedish ports of Malmö and Gothenburg, where she will take on
                        board 800 tons of iron, 3 first class and 300 steerage passengers. The
                        Stockholm City will therefore take across the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean
                        to Boston 2,000 tons cargo, chiefly iron, and 434 passengers, nearly all
                        emigrants.</p>
                    <p>This steamer will be followed by the Lincoln City, sailing from Stockholm for
                        New York June 14, and thereafter by the Gothenburg City, sailing from
                        Stockholm for Boston about July 10.</p>
                    <p>In my dispatch No. 65 I had the honor to inform you that the first <pb
                            n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0629"/>steamer of the Gothenburg line
                        sailed on May 1, from Gothenburg for New York.</p>
                    <p>The two lines of direct steamships announced to the Department in my
                        dispatches Nos. 29 and 35 of last year are now in actual operation. Direct
                        steam communication between the United States and Sweden is now a fact.
                        Sweden is now for the first time open to the direct shipment of American
                        products and manufactures by regular lines of steamships.</p>
                    <p>It is earnestly to be hoped that American exporters will give immediate and
                        careful attention to this new direct market, which is ready to receive and
                        consume considerable quantities of American wheat, flour, maize,
                        agricultural machines, fruit, canned goods, and Yankee notions.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It may perhaps be of interest to the
                        Department to learn that the Swiss Federal Council has issued an order,
                        under date of March 22, 1884, by virtue of which four so-called Anarchists
                        have been or will be expelled from Switzerland.</p>
                    <p>It is known that during the past few months fearful crimes have been
                        committed in Austria and Germany; that two men, Hermann Stellmacher and
                        Anton Kammerer, have been arrested in Vienna under indictment of having
                        committed some of these crimes; that these two men have, during the past few
                        years, been frequently domiciled in Switzerland, and that they, in their
                        nefarious business of rendering life and property in Austria and Germany
                        insecure, have been maintaining active personal relations with the following
                        named four foreigners, now residing in Switzerland, namely: Frederick Philip
                        Kennel, from Bavaria; Maurice Schulze, from Prussia; Karl Falk, from
                        Steiermark; and Mathias Lissa, from Bohemia.</p>
                    <p>The Swiss Federal Council, in view of the fact “that the public safety in
                        Germany and Austria is endangered” by anarchists, who have committed crimes
                        above referred to, and in virtue of the authority vested in them by article
                        70 of the federal constitution, which reads, “The confederation has the
                        authority to expel from its territory foreigners who endanger the internal
                        or external safety thereof,” have decreed that the above-named four
                        foreigners shall be expelled from Swiss territory.</p>
                    <p>It appears from the press that this action of the Federal Council is
                        generally approved by the public.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Almost every American mail brings letters
                        addressed to this legation (or to the consulate general) by natives of
                        Switzerland who have acquired citizenship in the United States, requesting
                        our good offices in the collection of patrimonies, legacies, and other forms
                        of property. As the Swiss Federal Council does not like to see the foreign
                        legations at this capital placing themselves in direct correspondence with
                        the cantonal governments, this legation has therefore declined to officially
                        attend to the collection of such property, unless instructed to do so by the
                        Department.</p>
                    <p>All such requests have, however, been attended to by the consul-general
                        connected with this legation, Mr. J. E. Hinnen, the vice and deputy
                        consul-general, acting under my supervision as the medium of communication
                        between the cantonal or communal authorities and the parties in the United
                        States whose property is to be collected.</p>
                    <p>In attending to such business we meet with many difficulties, the chief of
                        which is that the parties desiring us to collect their property have
                        generally failed to comply with the Swiss law concerning expatriation.</p>
                    <p>This law requires, among other things, that those who have expatriated
                        themselves and acquired citizenship in other countries should transmit to
                        the government of the canton of their birth a duly authenticated statement
                        of their renunciation of citizenship in said canton, with a request to
                        release them therefrom. This statement to be accompanied with legal proofs
                        of their having acquired citizenship elsewhere; that is, a duly certified
                        copy of their naturalization certificate. The principal reason therefor is
                        to preclude the possibility of such persons, in case of poverty, to return
                        to the community of their birth, for the purpose of claiming financial and
                        other aid from the local authorities thereof.</p>
                    <p>Unless these requirements are complied with these local authorities are not
                        willing to surrender such property and legacies. All this causes much
                        unnecessary correspondence between this legation and consulate-general on
                        one hand, and said local authorities and American citizens of Swiss birth on
                        the other, to say nothing of the insulting letters the latter class of
                        persons often address to us, if we are, for the reasons stated above,
                        unsuccessful in collecting their claims.</p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances I take the liberty to suggest that the Department
                        cause a statement to be published in English and German journals in the
                        United States making known to American citizens of Swiss birth what the
                        requirements of the Swiss law are respecting the collection of their claims
                        in their native homes. Much unnecessary correspondence and hard feelings
                        would thereby be avoided.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The new constitution of the Swiss
                        Confederation of 1848, was revised in 1874, and came into force on the 29th
                        of May of that year. According to this instrument, the legislative power is
                        lodged in the Federal Assembly, which consists of two houses, the “National
                        Council” (House of Representatives) and the “States’ Council” (Senate).
                        Among the articles of this constitution defining and limiting the powers of
                        the Federal Assembly is article 89, which contains a unique provision.
                        Translated this article reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>For federal laws and federal resolutions the consent of both houses
                                is necessary.</p>
                            <p>Besides, federal laws, as well as universally binding federal
                                resolutions which are not of an urgent character, shall be submitted
                                to the people for adoption or rejection in case 30,000 Swiss
                                citizens who are entitled to vote, or eight cantons, shall demand
                                it.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>Article 90 states that the Federal Assembly shall have the power by
                        appropriate legislation to make provision for carrying into effect the
                        intentions of the preceding article.</p>
                    <p>Now, since the adoption of the revised constitution, May 29, 1874, the <hi

                        to the people’s direct vote of laws passed by both houses of the Federal
                        Assembly has been adopted in ten distinct cases; that is, ten separate and
                        distinct laws passed by said assembly have thus been submitted to the people
                        upon the demand of the prescribed number of citizens.</p>
                    <p>The smallest number of citizens making such a demand was 35,886, and the
                        largest 180,995.</p>
                    <p>Out of these ten different laws only three were endorsed, adopted by the
                        people, and seven were rejected. The result of the popular vote in each case
                        was as follows: <list>
                            <item>The first law was adopted with 213,199 against 205,069

                    <p>Here we have democracy, pure and simple. In this manner the rights and wishes
                        of the minority are respected and maintained.</p>
                    <p>Besides, if the Federal Assembly should at any time during its term of
                        service lose its hold upon the people, or no longer represent their wishes
                        and convictions, said assembly will be taught by this method what the will
                        of the people is in any important matter.</p>
                    <p>But, on the other hand, such an operation may be convenient only for a
                        comparatively small country; for a large country like the United States a
                        political machinery of this character would doubtless be too cumbersome and
                        expensive.</p>
                    <p>One inference that may be drawn from the results of the use of the
                        “referendum” in Switzerland is, that in the majority of cases the people
                        appear to be more conservative than their chosen representatives, and the
                        lesson taught thereby is: The people may always be trusted.</p>

                        which you allude to the requirements of Swiss law in cases of expatriation,
                        I have to say that the existence of the difficulties which you point out in
                        the matter of collection of their claims to property by our naturalized
                        citizens of Swiss origin further shows the necessity of adjusting the whole
                        question by a proper treaty of naturalization between the two countries.</p>
                    <p>Your attention is called in this connection to instruction No. 7, of October
                        19, 1882. The requirements of the Swiss law to which you allude have been
                        communicated to the press.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Sir</hi>: * * * I have been requested by Mr.
                            Eyres, of Van, to send him details of my identifying the Kurdish
                            assassin who so severely wounded Dr. Reynolds, and beat and robbed both
                            him and me on May 22. Thinking it might be due to justice and yourself
                            to send you the same account, I will here give it. On the <pb n="533"
                                xml:id="pg_533" facs="0633"/>29th of September last I made a call
                            upon Arif Effendi, our Voli Pasha, and during the interview he took
                            occasion to say that we had reported to the officials at Constantinople
                            that one Moussa Bey was the man who attacked Dr. Reynolds last May. He
                            said that, according to instructions received, he would summon him, and
                            if I did not recognize him as the assailant he should let him go;
                            otherwise he would detain him as a prisoner.</p>
                        <p>On October 4 it was rumored that Moussa Bey went to the mountains south
                            of his village, and that word was brought back by the biubachi that the
                            Bey was ill and could not come.</p>
                        <p>This officer was sent again with specific instructions to bring the Bey
                            without fail.</p>
                        <p>On October 22, just five months to a day since the assault, I was
                            summoned to appear before the Moodier Ocmoomy to identify the
                            assailant.</p>
                        <p>Before going I called Hohannes Agh, our Protestant arzkevbet, and
                            inquired if he thought it was necessary for me to go; could I not
                            require that Moussa Bey be brought to my door, as were the four
                            prisoners. I was told that these prisoners were subsequently released on
                            their paying a bribe of two Turkish pounds each a few days after the
                            tragedy. He told me that Moussa Bey would submit himself to be flayed
                            alive rather than condescend to come. He furthermore sold me that I was
                            bound to answer but one question, “Do you recognize the assailant among
                            those brought before you?”</p>
                        <p>I felt quite ill from a severe cold and should like to have been released
                            from going. However, taking Baron Havatvoa as interpreter, and two
                            servants, we mounted our horses and in twenty minutes reached the
                            court-house.</p>
                        <p>Oh arriving I soon saw that I was to be questioned the same “Tadakhaz” or
                            judge before whom I was summoned on this matter June 11. What I supposed
                            would take only ten minutes proved to be an hour and a half. I will
                            state a few questions asked me, from which it appeared to my interpreter
                            and me they were befriending Moussa Bey.</p>
                        <p>First, the Tadakhaz said to me, “It is some five months since the
                            assault; have you an opinion who committed it?”</p>
                        <p>I replied, “I do not know who did it.”</p>
                        <p>“But you have telegraphed your ambassador that Moussa Bey, the son of
                            Meza Bey, and two others named,” giving the names.</p>
                        <p>I replied, “I have sent no such names; it is possible my associate has,”
                            meaning Dr. Reynolds.</p>
                        <p>Another question, “Do you know your assailants?”</p>
                        <p>I replied, “I might not recognize all of them, but I thought I should the
                            one who used the sword.”</p>
                        <p>After several more questions, he said: “We have summoned your assailants;
                            do you wish me to bring them before you? “I replied in the affirmative.
                            Four, I think, were ushered into the court-room attended by their guards
                            and several spectators. I scanned the face of each very closely, and
                            pointing my finger to one, said,” That is the man, for I recognize his
                            face.” He had come in with an affected unconcern, but when I pointed my
                            ringer at him his countenance suddenly blanched. He was of medium
                            height; had a florid complexion; his mustache of a light sandy color,
                            and the hair of his head a shade darker; of a full face, and apparently
                            near thirty years of age. He had on a large, gay head-dress of many
                            colors, a dark-colored broadcloth frock coat, and high-heeled shoes, but
                            “I see that he has on a different kind of dress,” said I. To which the
                            “Tadakhaz” replied, “That is not possible, for the one he has now is his
                            customary dress.” I should have said, “that is the man who used the
                            sword.” The “Tadakhaz “wrote down his name as Moussa Bey, son of Meza
                            Bey, as I was subsequently told by my interpreter. I was asked, “Did you
                            not see this man at your stopping place the night before the attack?” I
                            replied, “No.” At this, the man left his companions and ascended the
                            three or four steps, that took him to the platform, and stood by the
                            side of the chair in which I was seated. I was then asked, “How was it
                            that he should have come into the room where you were, and you not see
                            him?” I replied, “The room was very dark; the light of the only tallow
                            candle was dim. I was very much fatigued, and I did not pretend to
                            notice any one, and on drinking the tea the doctor gave me, I
                            immediately lay down to rest.” Upon this moment my assailant interrupted
                            me by saying, “That was strange, that you did not see me.” Whereupon he
                            was told to be silent.</p>
                        <p>I was repeatedly cautioned to see that I was not mistaken in the man, at
                            which I told the court the particulars of the appearance of the three
                            assailants as they walked in Indian file up the hill to meet us singing
                            a weird song. How I then marked his features, and then said to myself I
                            should carry the expression of that face to my grave, and that I thought
                            I could not be mistaken.</p>
                        <p>Of the three others brought before me, I did not recognize any one as our
                            other assailants, but I was afterward told that one was Moussa Bey’s
                            servant, and the other two were strangers brought in purposely to
                            perplex me.</p>
                        <p>After the prisoners were taken out the “Tadakhaz” turned around and
                            feeling that <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0634"/>he was going to
                            trip me by a question, said, “On May 23, when your deposition was taken,
                            you said that Moussa Bey called upon you the night of May 21. How is it
                            that you now say you never saw him?” I replied, “I have never seen him
                            to know him, and even now I do not know him by name. When the deposition
                            you refer to was taken both Dr. Reynolds and I were present. He might
                            have said that Moussa Bey called upon us, but I then made no such
                            statement.”</p>
                        <p>There was one Hagab Effendi, brother of Arides Effendi, present in court,
                            of which he is a member. My assailant was his guest, of whom he stands
                            in awe, and this Hagab plied me with questions with the view of puzzling
                            me and so defending the assailant.</p>
                        <p>On returning home I inquired of Baron Havatova, my interpreter, what was
                            the name of the man I pointed out as Dr. Reynolds’s assailant. He
                            replied, Moussa Bey.” Till then I was positive that it was he.</p>
                        <p>During this investigation there was a man in the ante-room who told my
                            servant that he believed Moussa Bey was the assailant, and added, “he
                            murdered my brother.” I have been told that Moussa Bey, while a boy,
                            murdered a Kurd. It is the prevailing opinion that he is the man who
                            attacked the doctor.</p>
                        <p>He was not imprisoned while here, and after appearing in our streets a

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur le Chargé d’Affaires</hi>: I had the honor
                            to receive the two notes you were pleased to address to me on the 7th
                            and 12th of November last, No. 185, relating to the act of aggression of
                            which Messrs. Reynolds and Knapp, American missionaries, were the
                            subject, in the neighborhood of Ghuarié.</p>
                        <p>The governor-general of the vilayet of Bitlis, of whom explanations had
                            been demanded on the subject, has just telegraphed to us that the
                            judicial authorities of the province, far from giving evidence of the
                            least negligence, are acting with the greatest celerity in the
                            examination of the affair.</p>
                        <p>Moussa Bey, designated by the plaintiff as the leader of the aggressors,
                            was immediately delivered into the hands of the authorities. As to Osmon
                            and Hassan, accused of complicity, it has been impossible so far to
                            arrest them, their domicile not having been discovered. Mr. Knapp, on
                            being questioned on this subject, has declared that he did not know them
                            and that he had no complaint against them. The tribunal before which the
                            case was brought has, in consequence, been obliged to write to the
                            attorney-general at Van to obtain the necessary information from Dr.
                            Reynolds, who is at present in that town.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Arif Pasha gives the assurance that nothing will be neglected to
                            hasten the course of justice.</p>
                        <p>In bringing these facts to your knowledge, I seize, &amp;c.,</p>

                            address to me on the 8th instant, No. 72953, 37, relative to the
                            explanations which have reached the imperial ministry on the subject of
                            the aggression against Messrs. Knapp and Reynolds, American
                            missionaries, in May last, in the neighborhood of Ghuarié.</p>
                        <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0635"/>
                        <p>I greatly regret that my duty obliges me to inform your highness that the
                            reports I have received on the subject do not agree with those that have
                            been made to the imperial ministry.</p>
                        <p>Although it is true that Moussa Bey, the principal assailant of Messrs.
                            Knapp and Reynolds, and who inflicted the nearly mortal wounds on the
                            latter, from which he is not yet recovered, was requested to appear
                            before the tribunal at Bitlis, to be confronted with Mr. Knapp, by whom
                            he was identified as one of his assailants, it is not the less true that
                            instead of being delivered up to justice, as stated by Arif Pasha, he
                            was allowed to return to his country upon promising to send to Bitlis
                            the person who, according to him, was the real culprit, for he naturally
                            claimed to be entirely guiltless of the crime.</p>
                        <p>It is with pain that I must state that the proceedings of the vilayet of
                            Bitlis in the course of this unfortunate affair have exhibited the most
                            indescribable inertia and indifference. Moreover the unfortunate
                            reputation of Arif Pasha gives us but little reason to hope that the
                            assailants of Messrs. Knapp and Reynolds will be brought to justice as
                            long as this functionary is maintained in the post of which he has shown
                            himself so unworthy, the more so as nearly seven months have elapsed
                            without any serious steps being taken to this end.</p>
                        <p>This legation having been unsuccessful, notwithstanding all its efforts,
                            in obtaining any reparation for the outrages of which my fellow-citizens
                            have been the victims, the only course remaining for me to take, your
                            highness, is to protest energetically against the imperial authorities
                            of the vilayet of Bitlis, who have so entirely neglected their duty, and
                            to transmit to my Government a report on this deplorable affair, with
                            all the accounts relating to it.</p>

                        of the 15th ultimo, relative to the complaint of Messrs. Knapp and Reynolds,
                        who were assaulted by brigands in Armenia in May, 1883.</p>

                        that this Government regards the case of those gentlemen as clearly made out
                        and the identification of the principal assailant as complete. Under these
                        circumstances it would be entirely incompatible with this Government’s sense
                        of dignity to attempt to support by argument what is so patent as to need no
                        such support, or to make appeal to Turkish sense of equity and good-will

                        with his highness, the minister of foreign affairs, relative to certain
                        persons claiming <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0636"/>American
                        citizenship by naturalization, but at present domiciled in Palestine, and to

                    <p>I have reason to believe that the movement on the part of the Sublime Porte
                        has application to the little colony of naturalized American Jews, which,
                        when visiting Jerusalem, I found resident there, in number thirty-five or
                        forty. They are mostly old men, and quite poor, who have betaken themselves
                        to Palestine as the most sacred of places, thinking that if they behaved
                        themselves and lived orderly lives they might be permitted to die and be
                        quietly buried there. It is, in my opinion, more than probable that some of

                        <p>According to reports received from the authorities of Jerusalem, a
                            certain number of Russian subjects, who left their country about five
                            years ago to live in Palestine, have been declared by the Russian
                            consular authorities to have forfeited their nationality and have
                            succeeded at a subsequent date to have themselves admitted as American
                            citizens.</p>
                        <p>A naturalization obtained in such conditions could evidently not be
                            recognized by the Imperial Government as legitimate and valid. The
                            ordinary principles of right oppose themselves to its admission in
                            European countries, and also, <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi>, in the
                            Ottoman Empire, where the capitulations assure to foreigners exceptional
                            immunities, and where, consequently, the control to be exercised by the
                            authorities on a change of nationality presents an indisputable question
                            of order.</p>
                        <p>In principle and in strict right, any foreigner established in the Empire
                            who should lose his rights to his original nationality must be
                            considered as an Ottoman subject, and if he desires to embrace this or
                            that other citizenship he is bound to go to the country whose
                            naturalization he desires to acquire to live there the number of years
                            fixed by the local laws and conform in all points required to obtain a
                            change of nationality.</p>
                        <p>In calling the attention of the United States legation to the preceding
                            considerations, the Sublime Porte likes to hope it will be good enough
                            to acknowledge the justness, and transmit conformable instructions to
                            its consul at Jerusalem.</p>

                            admitted as American citizens.</p>
                        <p>It is greatly to be regretted that the communication is not as particular
                            in its terms as the importance of the principles involved would seem to
                            justify. There are three classes of persons, however, to which the
                            application may be meant: First, a class <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537"
                                facs="0637"/>claiming American citizenship who have not even taken
                            out the first paper required of them by the law; second, a class
                            asserting the claim who have gone so far as to take out the first paper,
                            renouncing their original allegiance, but there stopped; and third, a
                            class who have in every point perfected their naturalization as citizens
                            of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The instructions given to the American consul at Jerusalem for his
                            government in the matter may be substantially stated for the
                            satisfaction of your highness.</p>
                        <p>A copy of the note with which your highness has honored me has been
                            transmitted to that official for his information; his attention is then
                            particularly called to the description of the persons referred to
                            therein, and he is directed to make diligent inquiry to ascertain if
                            there are such persons in his consular jurisdiction. If he finds there
                            are any fairly within the first of the classes above given, he is simply
                            to inform them that they have no right to his protection; if he finds
                            any who are properly of the second class he is to examine their papers,
                            take copies of them, and report upon their authenticity; of this second
                            class he is also to inquire when they left America, how long they have
                            been aboard, how long in Palestine, why they came abroad, why they took
                            up residence in Palestine, what business they are there engaged in, if
                            any, whether they intended returning to America when they left its
                            shores, and keep a record of their answers, together with all the
                            evidence for and against such intention which he can procure, including
                            why they have not returned, and when they now purpose doing so. When
                            these inquiries are concluded, he is directed to transmit a full report
                            of everything pertinent to the subject to this legation through the
                            consulate-general in Constantinople, the object being to refer each of
                            such cases to Washington for consideration there. I shall be happy to
                            apprise your highness of the decisions arrived at, and the instructions
                            I may receive concerning them, but until then I cannot admit the
                            principles and rules stated in your note as applicable to persons of
                            this second class.</p>
                        <p>As to persons whom he may find of the third class, he is told that if
                            they are orderly and going about their lawful business, whatever it may
                            be, and mindful of the laws of the Empire, they have a right to live
                            there unmolested; that this right is derived from the ancient
                            capitulations, of late days reaffirmed by the treaties existing between
                            the two Governments; that for conveniency, rather than a yielding up of
                            principle, the United States have, in instances, temporarily submitted
                            to claims insisted upon by friendly Governments against naturalized
                            citizens of the United States formerly subjects of those friendly
                            Governments, but who voluntarily returned and placed themselves under
                            their jurisdiction; that as yet all such cases have been settled by
                            amicable diplomatic arrangement; that the United States have never
                            admitted the right of a foreign government to decide upon and nullify in
                            any manner the franchises conferred under its naturalization laws, much
                            less have they sanctioned the extraordinary principle which appears for
                            the first time enunciated in your highness’ note, that if a person
                            naturalized in the United States, but resident in Turkey, has lost his
                                <hi rend="italic">original</hi> nationality, he becomes an Ottoman
                            subject, regardless of his American naturalization; that whatever ground
                            in right this principle may have with respect to naturalized American
                            citizens formerly Turkish subjects, it cannot be permitted application
                            to a naturalized American citizen originally the subject of a power not
                            Turkish. In accordance with these views the consul is instructed that if
                            he finds in his jurisdiction many or few naturalized Americans of the
                            third class they have a right to call upon him for protection, and it is
                            his duty to protect them; and to that end he must exhaust the means
                            usually of resort on such occasions; failing in them, he must close his
                            consulate and come away, if possible bringing the threatened people with
                            him; and that I have no doubt the Government of the United States will
                            have a vessel ready to receive him and them. These are, in substance,
                            the instructions given, and I leave them to derive additional force and
                            meaning from your highness’ great intelligence and long experience in
                            international affairs.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit to the
                        Department, for its consideration, a copy of a note which will be delivered
                        to his highness, the minister of foreign affairs as soon as a translation of
                        it can be prepared. <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0638"/>The subject is
                        the murderous assault committed last year by Kurds upon Rev. Mr. Knapp and
                        Dr. Reynolds, the particulars of which have been heretofore given you.</p>
                    <p>The decision to resort to demands for indemnity in these cases is the result
                        of much careful reflection, and a firm belief that there is no other method
                        of accomplishing redress. A reading of the course pursued in the matter by
                        the Turkish authorities, high and low, will, it is believed, bring the
                        Department to the same conclusion, and to an approval of the step I have
                        assumed to take.</p>

                        <p>The legation of the United States of America has the honor to invite the
                            attention of his highness, the minister of foreign affairs, to the
                            matters following:</p>
                        <p>By note No. 167, June 13, 1883, the legation informed his highness that
                            two American citizens, traveling in the vilayet of Bitlis, had been set
                            upon by Kurds, robbed, and left to die, and that the governor-general of
                            the vilayet had manifested the most singular indifference about the
                            affair, and might be fairly charged with responsibility for the escape
                            of the malefactors. The suggestion was then made that his highness would
                            serve the cause of humanity and justice by ordering the most energetic
                            measures to be taken for the apprehension of the robbers.</p>
                        <p>By a communication, No. 71235, June 13, 1883, his highness was good
                            enough to answer the note of the legation, and give the pleasing
                            intelligence that the governor-general had succeeded in discovering the
                            goods taken from the two gentlemen, and that the robbers had been
                            arrested and delivered up to justice. This information his highness
                            reported as derived from the governor-general.</p>
                        <p>This report the legation found it necessary to correct, and for that
                            purpose it addressed a second note to his highness the minister of
                            foreign affairs, No. 179, dated September 10, 1883, declaring that the
                            robbers had not been arrested, and that the goods and money taken from
                            Messrs. Knapp and Reynolds had been returned to them, hut in small
                            parts. Under impression that it was yet possible to obtain the powerful
                            assistance of the Sublime Porte in bringing the thieves and assassins to
                            justice, the legation in the same note proceeded to give the full
                            particulars of the affair, both those connected with the assault and
                            those descriptive of the action of the governor-general. Of the assault,
                            it remarked that Messrs. Knapp and Reynolds, accepting the assurance of
                            the governor-general that the roads were perfectly safe, set out on
                            their journey without a guard of zaptiehs. They put up for a night at a
                            house where there was present Moreoussa Bey, son of Meza Bey, an
                            influential Kurdish chief. When they took their coffee they failed to
                            send a cup of it to the said Moussa, who, feeling himself insulted by
                            the inattention, took four assistants and next day waylaid the
                            gentlemen, one of whom, Mr. Knapp, they beat with clubs until they
                            supposed him dead. Moussa Bey, with his own hand, cut down Dr. Reynolds,
                            giving him ten cuts with a sword. The two were then bound and dragged
                            into the bushes and there left to die. That there might be no excuse,
                            such as that the murderers were unknown, the legation gave his highness
                            the names of the subordinate assassins and their places of abode, Sherif
                            Oglon Osmon and Iskan Oglon Hassan, both of the villege of Movnok. A
                            third one was pointed out as the servant of Moussa Bey, living in the
                            village of Kabiaa. Of the action of the governor-general the legation
                            said further that when the affair was reported to him he made a show of
                            action by sending zaptiehs to arrest the robbers, but, singular to
                            remark, he selected Meza Bey, the father of Moussa, to take charge of
                            the party. Going to the village of Auzont, Meza Bey pointed out four
                            Kurds of another tribe as the guilty men, took them into custody and
                            carried them for indentification to Messrs. Knapp and Reynolds, who said
                            they were not the assailants.</p>
                        <p>During the night, in Aozou, a bundle was thrown through a window into a
                            room occupied by the police, which on examination proved to contain a
                            portion of the stolen goods. With this the governor-general rested from
                            his efforts and dispatched to <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0639"
                            />his highness the minister of foreign affairs, that the stolen goods
                            were recovered and returned, and the felons captured and punished. This
                            report the legation took the liberty of informing his highness was not
                            true, also that the chief of the assassins, Moussa Bey, was still at
                            large; and to emphasize its statement, the legation further said to his
                            highness that the details it communicated were current through all the
                            region of Bitlis, having been first given out by Moussa himself. The
                            legation then, in the same note, exposed the maladministration of the
                            governor-general in language plain as respect for his highness, the
                            minister, and for the Sublime Porte would permit, and suggested as the
                            only means of accomplishing anything like redress that a brave,
                            impartial officer be sent to Bitlis to investigate the conduct of the
                            governor and take the affair in his own hands. “Such a step,” it was
                            added, “might serve to save the lives of many Christians,” and it was
                            further represented that “could the assassins be brought to just
                            sentence it would unquestionably lessen the demand for indemnity which
                            otherwise it would be the duty of the legation to present against the
                            Imperial Government in this connection.”</p>
                        <p>On November 7, 1883, the legation of the United States, by a third note,
                            No. 184, communicated to his highness, the minister of foreign affairs,
                            that the governor-general of Bitlis had confronted four persons with Mr.
                            Knapp for identification, and that that gentleman had recognized Moussa
                            Bey as one of those who had robbed and wounded him. The legation of the
                            United States then expressed a hope that the minister of foreign affairs
                            would give proper orders for bringing Moussa Bey and his companions in
                            crime before the tribunals for trial.</p>
                        <p>Still later, on November 12, 1883, the legation of the United States
                            addressed a fourth note, No. 185, to his highness, the minister of
                            foreign affairs, detailing again the circumstances of the attempted
                            murder of Messrs. Knapp and Reynolds, and representing the
                            untrustworthiness of the governor-general by charging that Moussa Bey
                            had already obtained from him assurances of immunity in the event of a
                            trial and conviction.</p>
                        <p>His highness, the minister, was then requested that, if it was decided to
                            maintain the governor-general at his post, orders be given for the
                            transfer of the criminals to Constantinople for trial.</p>
                        <p>The three notes last named of the legation of the United States have not
                            been answered by his highness, the minister of foreign affairs, except
                            in a note, dated December 8, 1883, in which he is pleased to renew
                            assurances based upon telegrams from the governor-general, which are
                            utterly unreliable.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore, abandoning hope of justice through the governor-general of
                            Bitlis, and the judicial tribunals of the empire, the legation of the
                            United States finds itself compelled to change its form of application
                            for redress, and demand of the Sublime Porte indemnity in behalf of
                            Messrs. Knapp and Reynolds for the former £1,500, and for the latter,
                            because of the more serious nature of his injuries, £2,000.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The legation has been in receipt of several
                        notes from his highness, the minister of foreign affairs, requesting to be
                        furnished with lists of citizens of the United States resident in
                        Constantinople and other parts of the Empire. Of these notes copies are
                        transmitted as incisures 1, 3, and 5, with translations numbered 2, 4, and
                        6. Understanding from other quarters that the movement for such lists will
                        be extended to the whole country, dependent in a measure upon the nature of
                        the replies received in response to these invitations, it occurred to me to
                        draw a paper which might be taken as of general application, and a copy of
                        it is accordingly forwarded for your information.</p>
                    <p>That the Sublime Porte has a design underlying the requests herewith
                        inclosed, there is little doubt. The measure started against the colony of
                        Jewish Americans in Palestine may be accepted as an indication <pb n="540"
                            xml:id="pg_540" facs="0640"/>of the nature of that design; and as in
                        that measure the Sublime Porte appears disposed to take jurisdiction of
                        questions concerning the validity of the naturalization of American citizens
                        of foreign birth resident in its jurisdiction, it has seemed to me advisable
                        to oppose such a claim in its inception.</p>
                    <p>Probably this is as good an opportunity as may present itself to remark upon
                        the opposition which would appear the general rule to measures proposed by
                        the Turks, not a few of which on their face, and, in fact, are reasonable
                        and proper enough.</p>
                    <p>In the first place, it is to be always remembered that while the Christian
                        powers have no hope of acquiring for their subjects in Turkey any new or
                        additional privilege—political, social, religious, or commercial—the serious
                        and persistent attempts to deprive those subjects of rights already conceded
                        have driven the powers unitedly into a policy of defense, and that, simply
                        speaking, is the meaning of these constant refusals of the overtures and
                        assertions which come to them from the Sublime Porte. Secondly, confining
                        observation to American interests exclusively, it will in most instances
                        prove the case that we must resist measures set on foot by the Sublime
                        Porte, not because the measures themselves are unjust, but because, if we
                        consent to them and the other powers protest, it will follow necessarily
                        that our people will be thrown into conditions of comparative
                        disadvantage.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>very respectfully, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p>It appears from a communication received from the Department of the
                            Interior that foreigners living at Makrikeny refuse to allow themselves
                            to be inscribed on the census register until their consulates invite
                            them to submit themselves to the formality.</p>
                        <p>In bringing this fact before the legation of the United States of
                            America, the ministry of foreign affairs begs it to be good enough to
                            instruct whom it may concern so that the American citizens established
                            in the locality above mentioned may no longer object to the census.</p>

                        <p>It appears from a recent report of the governor-general of Adrianople
                            that the American consul in that city refuses to assist the commission
                            charged with the inscription of foreign subjects residing in the
                            province, until he receives formal instructions from his superior

                            necessary to refer to the former communications on this subject, and has
                            the honor again to beg the legation of the United States of America to

                                    about the citizenship of those inscribed on any of them by any
                                    official or before any tribunal of the Imperial Government after
                                    the lists are transmitted to his highness, the minister of

                            citizenship as a fact where it rightfully belongs—that is to the consuls
                            and consular agents of the Government of the United States.</p>

                            perfected, whereupon they will be at once transmitted to his highness,

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to forward a copy and
                        translation of a communication from the Sublime Porte upon the subject of
                        the attack upon Messrs. Knapp and Reynolds. It would seem to have been
                        prepared before the reception of my note demanding indemnity, although it
                        actually came to hand after that paper had been dispatched to his highness,
                        the minister of foreign affairs.</p>
                    <p>It is in effect but a repetition of former notes, having no better foundation
                        for its explanations and assurances than the reports of the governor of
                        Bitlis.</p>
                    <p>His highness, the minister of foreign affairs, has not been to his office for
                        more than two weeks. * * *</p>
                    <p>The last time I had the honor of an interview with his highness, the the
                        minister of foreign affairs, he told me plainly that it had been resolved in
                        the council of ministers to recall the governor of Bitlis. I pressed him to
                        tell me when the order would be put in execution. He would give me no
                        assurance or promise. From the note forwarded to you, it will be seen that
                        the governor is still in office and that the Sublime Porte continues him in
                        its confidence.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Envoy</hi>: I have received the note which Mr.
                            Heap was good enough to address me the 13th December last, No. 190,
                            relative to the attack of which Messrs. Knapp and Reynolds were the
                            objects, in the vicinity of Ghuvrie.</p>
                        <p>I have not failed to communicate the matter to the minister of the
                            interior, who has in response transmitted me the explanatory
                            circumstances which the imperial authorities of the province of Bitlis
                            have given him of the subject. As a result of the information which has
                            been given them of the attack, the imperial authorities have shown the
                            greatest zeal in investigating the affair. All the goods and effects
                            stolen were immediately recovered and restored to their owners. At, the
                            same time the suspected persons found in the village where the said
                            property was secreted have been arrested, but when confronted with Mr.
                            Knapp, he having declared that he did not recognize them as his
                            assailants, they were naturally turned loose. Later, upon the
                            representation of the United States legation, Moussa Bey was arrested as
                            the principal culprit; but upon being confronted in turn with Mr. Knapp,
                            the latter declared that he had no grievance against him, and he was not
                            recognizable by his associate, and that he had never made complaints
                            against them. Nevertheless, orders have been sent to the imperial
                            attorney at Van, that he ask of Mr. Reynolds, who is at present in that
                            city, some explanations on the point. But as Moussa Bey could not be
                            equitably eommitted on the deposition of Mr. Knapp, he was also turned
                            loose under bail, conformably to the law.</p>
                        <p>The local authorities continue to exert all their efforts to accomplish
                            the discovery and punishment of the guilty parties, who are sought for
                            with all possible diligence.</p>
                        <p>In consequence of the explanations above given, I hope your excellency
                            will be so good as to recognize in justice that the imperial authorities
                            of the vilayet of Bitlis are exerting themselves all they pan to fulfill
                            their duties.</p>
                        <p>Kindly accept, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your attention is respectfully called to
                            the accompanying <hi rend="italic">note verbale</hi> from the Sublime
                            Porte, and you are requested to be so good as to send a copy of it to
                            Mr. Merrill, the United States consul at Jerusalem, for his information.
                            Touching the subject of the said note, you are also requested to
                            instruct Mr. Merrill as follows:</p>
                        <p>There are three classes of persons to whom the note of the Sublime Porte
                            may have application: First, a class claiming American citizenship who
                            have not even taken out the first papers required of them by the law;
                            second, a class asserting the claim who have gone so far as to take out
                            the first paper renouncing their original allegiance, but there stopped;
                            and a third class who have in every point perfected their naturalization
                            as citizens of the United States.</p>
                        <p>If Consul Merrill finds within his jurisdiction persons claiming his
                            protection who are fairly within the first of the classes given, he will
                            inform them they have no claim upon him; if he finds any who are
                            properly of the second class, he will examine their papers, take copies
                            of them, and report upon their authenticity. Of this second class he
                            will also inqnire when they left the United States, how long they have
                            been in Palestine, what business they are there engaged in, if any, why
                            they came abroad, why they took up residence in Palestine, whether they
                            intended to return to America when they left its shores, why they have
                            not returned, and if they intend to return. He will keep record of their
                            answers, together with all evidence of whatever kind he can procure for
                            or against such intention. When his inquiries are concluded he will
                            transmit a full report of everything pertinent to the subject to this
                            legation through your consulate, the object being to refer each of such
                            cases to Washington for consideration there. As to persons whom he may
                            find of the third class, if they are orderly and going about their
                            lawful business, whatever it be, they have a right to live there
                            unmolested. This right is derived from the ancient capitulations, of
                            late days reaffirmed by treaties existing between the two Governments;
                            that for conveniency, rather than a yielding up of principle, the United
                            States have in instances temporarily submitted to claims insisted upon
                            by friendly Governments against naturalized citizens of the United
                            States, formerly subjects of those friendly Governments, but who
                            voluntarily returned and placed themselves under their jurisdiction;
                            that as yet all such cases have been settled by amicable diplomatic
                            arrangements; that the United States have never admitted the right of a
                            foreign Government to decide upon or nullify in any manner the
                            franchises conferred under its naturalization laws, much less have they
                            sanctioned the extraordinary principle which appears for the first time
                            enunciated by the Sublime Porte—that if a person naturalized in the
                            United States, but resident in Turkey, has lost his original
                            nationality, it having been other than Turkish, he becomes an Ottoman
                            subject regardless of his American naturalization; that whatever ground
                            in right this principle may have as respects naturalized American
                            citizens formerly Turkish subjects, it cannot be permitted application
                            to a naturalized American citizen originally the subject of a power not
                            Turkish. In accordance with these views, Consul Merrill will be informed
                            that all naturalized citizens of the <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544"
                                facs="0644"/>United States within his jurisdiction have a right to
                            call upon him for protection, and that it is his duty to protect them.
                            To that end he must, if necessary, exhaust the means usually of resort
                            on such occasions.</p>

                        317, of the 25th ultimo, relative to the case of the Rev. Mr. Knapp and Dr.
                        Reynolds, murderously attacked by Kurds near Bitlis, and to say that, after
                        a careful consideration of all the facts before the Department, the inaction
                        of the governor of Bitlis and the failure of the supreme Government to force
                        him to undertake such measures as the case evidently demanded, must be
                        regarded as a denial of justice. While this Government is always averse to
                        making money demands for indemnity in countries whose administration of
                        justice may differ from our own, the Department feels compelled to resort to
                        this remedy under circumstances which manifestly make the local officers and
                        the Government of the Porte responsible for the failure to do justice in

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit, for your
                        information, a copy and translation of a communication received last night
                        from his highness, the minister of foreign affairs, in reply to the portion
                        of my note to the grand vizier, No. 201, pertaining to the demand in the
                        case of Dr. Maurice Pflaum.</p>
                    <p>With my previous dispatches upon this subject on the files of the Department,
                        and of easy reference, it is hardly necessary to particularly notice the
                        points the worthy minister is pleased to dwell upon in the communication now
                        transmitted. To one sentence, however, I beg permission to call your
                        attention. Referring to Dr. Pflaum’s alleged battery of a sergeant and
                        corporal, his highness says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>This act falling within the purview of the law, the judicial
                                authorities have necessarily to take hold of it, all the more that
                                the Imperial Government cannot abandon the position it has always
                                maintained in affirmance of the competency of the Ottoman courts in
                                criminal causes. The meaning is very plain. It is a declaration of
                                the intent of the Sublime Porte to give effect to its pretension
                                with respect to Article IV of the treaty of 1830. Thus understood it
                                is for the President to decide whether our view of that article is
                                to be maintained or not.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0645"/>
                    <p>Another point put forward by his highness is equally worthy of consideration.
                        It will be observed he defends the assumption of the court at Axos to hear
                        and condemn Dr. Pflaum in a criminal prosecution, there being no consular
                        delegate present. This is done at the expense of the plain meaning of
                        paragraph 10 of the protocol of 1874, concerning the right of foreigners to
                        own real estate in Turkey. The “nine hours” provision, as it there appears,
                        gives jurisdiction to the native tribunals for the trial of foreigners
                        without the assistance of a consular delegate within limitations: first, for
                        for actions (civil) not exceeding 1,000 piasters; and, second, for offenses
                        (criminal) entailing a maximum fine of 500 piasters. Unfortunately Dr.
                        Pflaum’s sentence was imprisonment. To make the usurpation, of the
                        authorities of Axos still more glaring, they exec a ted the judgment in
                        violation of paragraph 13 of the same protocol, which says: <quote
                            rend="blockquote">
                            <p>In all cases the forcible execution of the judgments, issued on the
                                conditions determined heretofore (§10), shall not take place without
                                the co-operation of the consul or of his delegate.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>The authorities imprisoned Dr. Pflaum without such co-operation, in fact,
                        against the protest of the American consul.</p>
                    <p>These two clauses as always heretofore interpreted have formed most important
                        defenses for Christians remotely resident from their consuls, and I am sure
                        you will agree with me that good policy requires their steady maintenance
                        against the assumptions put forth by his highness, the minister of foreign
                        affairs.</p>
                    <p>My reply to his highness is inclosed by copy.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monsieur l’Envoyé</hi>: With my note of the 30th of
                            September last, No. 722, 62, 32, I had the honor to inform your
                            excellency that the question of Dr. Pflaum, an American citizen, had
                            been submitted to the appreciation of the ministry of justice.</p>
                        <p>The answer of that department has arrived at the Sublime Porte, which has
                            thought necessary to make it the object of a new examination.</p>
                        <p>The facts as disclosed by the inquiry to which it had been proceeded on
                            the spot have been confined in the note of my department dated the 14th
                            of August, No. 717, 14, 27. They establish to the evidence the wrongs of
                            Dr. Pflaum, who, not being satisfied by having insulted the director of
                            the tithes, ill-treated and beat a sergeant and a corporal, wounding
                            also the latter, while they were in the discharge of their duties. This
                            act falling under the thumb of the law, the judicial authority had to
                            take it up, so much the more that the Imperial Government cannot abandon
                            the point of view to which it has always placed itself to affirm the
                            competency of the Ottoman tribunals in penal matters.</p>
                        <p>If, however, the court of Axos has tried Dr. Pflaum in the absence of a
                            consular delegate, the reason of this is that no consulate was to be
                            found in the vicinity, that is to say, within a distance of nine hours
                            from the place where the acts laid to his charge took place—a
                            circumstance that, in conformity with the dispositions of the protocol
                            annexed to the law of the 7th September, 1284, gives within some limits
                            to the local authorities the right to have a foreigner tried without the
                            assistance of the consular delegate. It is true also that the protocol
                            appealed to does not grant the right of trial without any consular
                            assistance except in cases where the committed contraventions would not
                            carry but the condemnation to a fine of 500 piasters maximum.</p>
                        <p>With that the minister of justice is of opinion that the administrative
                            authority having no quality to intervene in the action of the tribunals,
                            the independence of which is solemnly consecrated by the laws of the
                            country, Dr. Pflaum may on the <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0646"
                            />basis of the same protocol make an appeal before the court of the
                            sandjak against the judgment given by the court of Axos and get himself
                            attended by a delegate of the consulate to which he belongs.</p>
                        <p>On its side my department will renew its correspondence with the
                            competent ministry in order to apply to the official who should be found
                            in fault in this affair such measure of punishment as he shall have
                            incurred by his conduct.</p>
                        <p>I hope the decision arrived at will satisfy your excellency.</p>
                        <p>As to according Dr. Pflaum a pecuniary indemnity, the Imperial Government
                            cannot recognize such a claim, judicial redress being open to him, as I
                            had the honor to state above. It is the duty of the judicial authorities
                            to examine all the circumstances of the case and for them to give a
                            final decision; besides, in penal causes, there is no legal provision
                            giving a private individual, who feels himself injured, the right to
                            claim pecuniary indemnity from the state.</p>
                        <p>I hope your excellency will kindly appreciate at their true value the
                            preceding considerations.</p>

                            of this date, No. 73708, 6, in reply to so much of the communication
                            which I had the honor of delivering to his highness, the grand vizier,
                            as pertained to my demands in behalf of Dr. Pflaum, I beg permission to
                            state some objections to certain positions which it has pleased you to
                            assume therein.</p>
                        <p>The declaration you indulge respecting “the competency of the Ottoman
                            courts in criminal cases,” while carefully noted, is sufficiently
                            covered by former protests of my Government.</p>
                        <p>Your highness also defends the assumption of right to try and condemn Dr.
                            Pflaum on a criminal charge in the absence of an American consul or
                            delegate, resting the claim of right upon paragraph 10 of the protocol
                            of 1874, regulative of the holding of real property by foreigners in
                            Turkey. You will permit me to object to your interpretation of that
                            paragraph. If it be true that Axos is nine hours distant from the
                            nearest American consular agency, still Dr. Pflaum’s case was not a
                            civil action, nor was it an offense (criminal) entailing a maximum fine
                            of 500 piasters. The court sentenced him to imprisonment, and in doing
                            so was guilty, in my opinion, of a flagrant usurpation. Nor did the
                            misconduct stop at that; in violation of paragraph 13 of the same
                            protocol, the authorities proceeded to a forcible execution of the
                            judgment against Dr. Pflaum “without the co-operation of a consul or of
                            his delegate.”</p>
                        <p>These, I beg to say, are the essential abuses complained of in the case
                            by this legation.</p>
                        <p>I await, &amp;c.,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your dispatch No. 318, of the 26th ultimo,
                        reports the several requests addressed to you by the Porte looking to your
                        intervention to secure an official census registry of citizens of the United
                        States in certain parts of the Turkish dominions, and acquaints me with your
                        reply of January 25, in the form of a <hi rend="italic">note verbale</hi>
                        sent to the imperial ministry for foreign affairs.</p>
                    <p>I readily comprehend the difficulties pointed out in your dispatch, which lie
                        in the way of prompt accession to these apparently simple and <pb n="547"
                            xml:id="pg_547" facs="0647"/>practical requests. In addition to these,
                        however, most of which, as you rightly explain, concern only the peculiar
                        relations with the Government of the Porte which spring from the
                        capitulations and from the radical differences of administrative methods in
                        the two countries, there is another consideration, general in its
                        application, which this Government has found it necessary to insist upon in
                        its dealings with certain of its neighbors, notably Mexico, and which might
                        arise with Turkey, if it be admitted that we are under an obligation to
                        cause a registry of our citizens abroad to be made. While such registry may
                        be convenient in the relations of countries, it cannot be admitted as a
                        determination of the question of citizenship. Failure to register should not
                        exclude the party from opportunity to show his citizenship by competent
                        proof; and a Government which has failed through any cause to procure the
                        registry of one of its citizens in the consular list can under no
                        circumstances be deemed to have thereby barred its citizen or estopped
                        itself from the diplomatic resort in case of wrong being done to him.</p>
                    <p>Hence this Government abstains from any action which might imply an
                        obligation on its part, or on the part of its officers, to furnish any
                        foreign Government with lists of those whom it will, in a given emergency,
                        protect as citizens. The laws of the foreign state may require some form of
                        registration. In such a case, although it is no part of the duty of our
                        officers abroad to execute the local police regulations with regard to their
                        fellow-citizens, we place no obstacle in the way; on the contrary, where
                        such local registry requires the production and filing of a consular
                        certificate independent of or supplementary to a regular passport, our
                        regulations permit the issuance of such a certificate. (Consular
                        Regulations, 1881, paragraph 163.)</p>
                    <p>These being the views of this Department, I cannot entirely approve your
                        proposition to the minister of foreign affairs. Your first condition
                        prescribes the unquestioned recognition of the citizenship of any person
                        borne on the consular lists as transmitted by the legation to the foreign
                        office, which may imply a responsibility on our side to perfect such lists,
                        and a disability on the part of any omitted citizen to prove his status or
                        claim diplomatic redress.</p>
                    <p>Your second condition asks that a consular certificate shall be accepted by
                        Turkish officers everywhere as conclusive proof of the fact of citizenship.
                        It does not appear from the correspondence you transmit that the Turkish
                        authorities request the issuance of such certificates, or that the
                        exhibition of a regular passport is not entirely sufficient to comply with
                        their police requirements. Statute and regulations are alike clear in
                        inhibiting the granting or issuing of any instrument in the nature of a
                        passport as a substitute therefor. As the issuance of the certificates you
                        suggest does not appear to fall within the exception contemplated by section
                        163 of the Consular Regulations of 1881, and does not appear to be made
                        dependent upon the possession of a passport, it is thought that it would
                        prove an embarrassing irregularity to prescribe the issuance by the several
                        consuls and consular agents in Turkish dominions of an independent
                        certificate of citizenship for which it would seem that the same immediate
                        respect is to be claimed as is usually paid to a formal passport.</p>
                    <p>The true principle would appear to be to regard local registration as a
                        police requirement, which it is not our concern to perfect or in any way to
                        make conclusive against any unregistered citizen. In the provinces our
                        consuls may counsel their fellow countrymen to register as required; in
                        Constantinople you may, for convenience sake, furnish a list of American
                        residents there, so far as known to you. For all purposes <pb n="548"
                            xml:id="pg_548" facs="0648"/>of protection a passport should suffice as
                            <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> evidence of citizenship and identity.
                        If required, a consular officer’s certificate in the Turkish language may
                        supplement a passport, and be entitled to consideration.</p>
                    <p>With these explanations you will have no difficulty in remodeling your
                        proposition to the minister of foreign affairs, especially if, as is not
                        unlikely, an indisposition should be manifested to accept your proposition
                            <hi rend="italic">in toto.</hi></p>

                        declining the redress demanded of his Government in the eases of Messrs.
                        Knapp and Reynolds.</p>
                    <p>You will please excuse a remark explanatory of a point in my telegram to you,
                        dated yesterday. I say therein, “Indemnity and punishment refused in each
                        case.” In reading the inclosed reply of the minister you may possibly be
                        attracted by his repeated references to the action of the judiciary
                        tribunals of Bitlis. That, I beg to say, is nothing. The tribunals of that
                        province cannot be relied upon to do justice. They have been already fully
                        appealed to in these cases. To refer us to them is simply a refusal of
                        redress. In that view I telegraphed you.</p>

                            receive the note your excellency kindly addressed to me on the 24th of
                            January last, No. 198, relative to the aggression Messrs. Knapp and
                            Reynolds have been subjected to in the vicinity of Ghuvrié.</p>
                        <p>Whichever may be the contradictions which exist between the information
                            which has reached the legation of the United States and that furnished
                            to us by the imperial authorities of the vilayet of Bitlis, your
                            excellency will permit me, before knowing the result of the
                            correspondence in which I have engaged upon this subject with the
                            competent ministry, not to desist from the affirmations of the local
                            authorities which have insisted over and over again that they have
                            fulfilled their duties since the beginning, and if the culprits have not
                            yet received their punishment it is not their fault, as they have given
                            to this affair a continued attention and vigilance.</p>
                        <p>The justice being busy with the case, it is of necessity to let it have
                            its regular course, and if there are some delays, evidently the fault
                            should not be thrown upon the authorities.</p>
                        <p>In fact, your excellency will kindly admit that in all the countries of
                            the earth, often the circumstances amidst which occurrences of such a
                            kind take place, and the difficulties which are most of the time
                            inherent, place the justice in the impossibility of deciding with all
                            the promptitude and celerity desirable. It has never been disputed that
                            its duty is to surround itself with the greatest precautions to bring
                            the <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0649"/>light so as not to have
                            later to reproach itself with the fatal consequences of a judicial
                            error.</p>
                        <p>I can but beg your excellency to be kind enough to leave to the competent
                            authorities the care of doing their duty. You may be assured that we
                            will do all that is possible for us to do in order to put an end to the
                            contradictions which subsist between the information furnished on both
                            sides, and to accelerate the course of the affair, within the limits,
                            bovver, which the independence of the judicial power imposes upon
                            us.</p>
                        <p>For all these reasons the demand for indemnity presented by your
                            excellency cannot be taken in consideration; the more so as the laws of
                            the Empire in no case permit it.</p>
                        <p>I am in the firm hope that in your enlightened sentiment your excellency
                            will recognize the justness of the preceding appreciations.</p>

                        information a copy and translation of a communication received yesterday
                        from the Sublime Porte relative to certain persons in Jerusalem claiming to
                        be naturalized citizens of the United States, but whose claims the Sublime
                        Porte could not recognize.</p>
                    <p>The subject is fully disclosed in my dispatch to the Department, No. 315,
                        dated January 24, 1884.</p>
                    <p>The explanation given by the minister of foreign affairs in the present paper
                        will doubtless be satisfactory, and serve to remove the idea that the
                        Sublime Porte was contemplating assumption of a right to decide upon
                        questions of Amercan naturalization.</p>
                    <p>To prevent possible complications between the imperial authorities of

                        it best to send him the additional instruction referred to in my reply to
                        the minister of foreign affairs, a copy of which is also herewith

                            excellency did me the honor to address me on the 24th of January last,
                            No. 196, in answer to the <hi rend="italic">note verbale</hi> of my
                            department, dated January 22, No. 73375, 1, relative to some
                            individuals, formerly Russian subjects, who would seem to be trying to
                            place themselves under the protection of the United States consulate at
                            Jerusalem.</p>
                        <p>The observations your excellency makes in connection with this question
                            renders it my duty to return to the import and the real meaning of my
                            communication.</p>
                        <p>The imperial ministry had no intention of generally discussing the
                            question of naturalization or foreign nationality. Its intention was
                            neither to contest the validity of the naturalization obtained in the
                            United States by persons who are not of Turkish origin nor to establish
                            a control on the change of nationality effected in this way by them.
                            Still less had it the idea of questioning the status of real American
                            citizens residing in the territory of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
                        <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0650"/>
                        <p>The object of the above-mentioned note was simply to call the attention
                            of the United States legation to the particular and altogether irregular
                            case of some persons, formerly Russian subjects, who left their country
                            to come and establish themselves at Jerusalem, and who, without ever
                            having been in America, claim the privileges of American citizens. In
                            disputing the right, these individuals have conferred upon themselves,
                            the Sublime Porte rests on the incontestable principle everywhere
                            recognized in matters concerning change of nationality.</p>
                        <p>Any individual who desires to renounce his original nationality and
                            become the subject or citizen of another state, must have emigrated from
                            his native country and have established himself in the country which in
                            future is to become his adopted country.</p>
                        <p>This has not been the case with the former Russian subjects mentioned in
                            the note of my department.</p>
                        <p>They have at no time made a sojourn in the United States, and the
                            naturalization they claim to have obtained being but <hi rend="italic"
                                >fictitious</hi> and <hi rend="italic">delusive</hi> the Sublime
                            Porte cannot recognize them. The Imperial Government considers any
                            inhabitant of the Empire who does not belong to another country, or has
                            ceased to have another nationality, as a Turkish subject, and must
                            regard any foreign naturalization of such individuals, when obtained
                            during their residence in the Ottoman Empire, as irregular and
                            fictitious.</p>
                        <p>I am pleased to hope, Monsieur l’Envoyé, that the above explanations will
                            suffice to clear away any misunderstanding which may have arisen from my
                            preceding communication, and will give your excellency to understand the

                            receipt of the note No. 73820, 10, and dated March 11 instant, which you
                            kindly addressed to me relative to certain persons, formerly Russian
                            subjects, and at present in Jerusalem, claiming to be United States
                            citizens, but whose naturalization you impeach on the ground that they
                            have never been in the United States.</p>
                        <p>I hasten to thank your highness for the very clear explanation given in
                            the present note, and to say that I will take pleasure in immediately
                            forwarding it to the authorities of my Government.</p>
                        <p>I will also cause it to be communicated to the American consul at

                        <p>By reference to my note No. 196, January 24 last, your highness will
                            observe the classification there given of persons who might be at
                            present in Jerusalem claiming to be naturalized citizens of the United
                            States of America.</p>
                        <p>The first class is of those who have no ground for such claim, not having
                            taken out the first paper required of them by the law.</p>
                        <p>These the consul is instructed to inform that they have no right to

                            Jerusalem to furnish his excellency the governor of Jerusalem with a

                        and translation of a communication from the imperial ministry of foreign
                        affairs, No. 73964, 11, relative to Messrs. Knapp and Reynolds.</p>
                    <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0651"/>
                    <p>Availing myself of the first opportunity to see his highness, the minister,
                        last Thursday, I directed his attention to the business and begged to know
                        of him if the authorities were doing anything to accomplish the punishment
                        of Moussa Bey. While the conversation was in progress he sent for the note,
                        which is inclosed by copy, and delivered it to me. The communication will
                        doubtless be read with interest. The impression it produced upon me was such
                        that, speaking in moderation, I will be more than ever surprised if Moussa
                        Bey is brought to trial. It would seem that he was discharged from custody,
                        and that now the greatest exertion is being made to accomplish his
                        rearrest.</p>
                    <p>The remark that I know the circumstances which prevented the detention of the
                        Kurd, is a reference to the assertion of the governor of Bitlis, heretofore
                        reported to you, that when Mr. Knapp was confronted with the man he failed
                        to identify him, an assertion in which I have not the slightest faith.</p>
                    <p>Whatever my own views of the outcome of the new effort to secure Moussa Bey
                        and punish him may be, I beg you to be assured that your instructions are
                        received as definitive of my duty.</p>

                            have been dispatched to all parts of the province to pursue and arrest

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your No. 315 of January 24 last, inclosing the
                        correspondence between your legation and the Turkish Government touching
                        certain persons of Russian origin claiming to be American citizens domiciled
                        in Palestine, has been received, as also your No. 327 of February 14.</p>
                    <p>It would appear that those persons have been declared by the Russian consular
                        representatives to have lost Russian citizenship, and it is <pb n="552"
                            xml:id="pg_552" facs="0652"/>understood to be the claim of the Turkish
                        Government that by the fact of so ceasing to be Russians they, being within
                        Ottoman jurisdiction, become subjects of the Porte, thus ignoring their
                        claim to American citizenship.</p>
                    <p>Your note to the minister for foreign affairs as to the rights of
                        fully-naturalized citizens is approved. The Department reserves to itself,
                        however, the decision of ultimate measures of protection in such cases if
                        ordinary steps are unavailingly exhausted, which is, of course, not to be
                        anticipated.</p>
                    <p>A decision as to the second class of persons possibly claiming the protection
                        of the United States, as set forth in your note, viz, those who may have
                        declared their intention, is reserved until the consul’s report called for
                        by you shall be received, although it may be said now that so far as it may
                        concern persons of an original allegiance other than Turkish the declaration
                        of intention is not of itself a renunciation of original allegiance, but
                        simply a record of declared intention to renounce such allegiance on
                        becoming a citizen of the United States. While, as an abstract question,
                        they continue, from one point of view, to be, for example, Russian subjects,
                        they acquire by such declaration of intention, a quasi right to protection
                        as against the claim of a third power to their allegiance. This Government
                        could not, in that case, admit that persons of the second class became
                        Turkish subjects because they intended to throw off Russian allegiance at
                        some future day. We would hold in case of dispute on this point that they
                        retain a future right to perfect their naturalization in conformity with our
                        laws.</p>
                    <p>As to the first class, your view is approved. No one can be lawfully
                        naturalized outside of American jurisdiction.</p>

                        1st instant, stating that the Government of Turkey has refused the demands
                        of your legation in the cases of Messrs. Knapp and Reynolds, and I have to
                        say that our recent instruction shows the attitude this Government maintains
                        with reference to those claims. As you have already been advised, the
                        Turkish minister here has been informed that we do not admit that the court
                        at Bitlis has done its duty. In renewing, as was done, demand for the arrest
                        and trial of Moussa Bey, we sufficiently imply our inability to regard the
                        proceedings at Bitlis, on which the Porte relies for justification, as other
                        than a denial of justice, which, under international law and usage, is a
                        legitimate subject of complaint and redress through diplomatic channels.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I transmit herewith for your information the
                        inclosed copies of dispaches No. 67, of January 18 last, and No. 323, of the
                        5th ultimo, from our consul at Beirut, Syria, and consul-general at
                        Constantinople, in relation to the difficulties encountered by American
                        citizens and graduates of the American college at Beirut in their endeavor
                        to practice their profession in the Ottoman Dominions.</p>
                    <p>To some extent the onerous and unjust discriminations of the Turkish
                        authorities in respect of this general subject are familiar to your
                        legation, the case of the late Dr. Calhoun being a recent one in point.</p>
                    <p>In that case, where it was sought to impose unreasonable restrictions in
                        regard to Dr. Calhoun’s medical practice, the Department endeavored to
                        secure for him only such treatment in respect to his examination as was
                        enjoyed by medical practitioners, citizens or subjects of other countries,
                        residing and practicing in Turkey. So, too, in the present instance, where
                        the cases are practically the same, we ask only fair and impartial treatment
                        for our citizens who desire to follow their profession in that country.</p>
                    <p>It is difficult to believe that the Turkish Government would knowingly permit
                        its local authorities to so unjustly discriminate against American medical
                        practitioners. This is the more singular and to be regretted when it is
                        remembered that our citizens have been regularly graduated from the college
                        at Beirut, a chartered and trustworthy institution, having authority to
                        confer such diplomas, and in view of the undoubted statement that no such
                        exactions as are sought to be imposed upon our citizens are attempted or
                        enforced against medical practitioners of other nationalities, even when
                        they have not followed any prescribed course of study. Yet this is precisely
                        the situation as represented by Mr. Robeson, whose strenuous efforts have
                        unfortunately been thus far unavailing to stop or prevent so unjust a
                        discriminatory practice. Nor, I regret to add, so far as Mr. Heap’s
                        knowledge goes, have those which have been put forth by the legation or
                        consulate-general for the relief of our citizens in such cases been hardly
                        more satisfactory, notwithstanding the orders and promises of the Turkish
                        Government. The faculty of the college at Beirut now hope for one of the
                        following privileges: <list>
                            <item>First. A charter as an independent medical college, with power to
                                grant legal degrees in medicine and surgery.</item>
                            <item>Second. The privilege of granting degrees in medicine and surgery,
                                which, to be legalized, shall be forwarded to Constantinople through
                                the American minister or consulate-general, to be signed and sealed
                                by the Imperial College officials.</item>
                            <item>Third. Failing in either of these, the appointment of an examining
                                board of Government physicians in Beirut or Damascus with power to
                                grant a certificate to the graduates of the American college after
                                they have passed a satisfactory examination before the said board,
                                which certificate shall authorize the holder to practice medicine
                                anywhere in the Ottoman Empire.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>These propositions appear reasonable and just, and any one of them, if
                        adopted, would doubtless afford a practical and satisfactory solution of the
                        present difficulties surrounding American medical practitioners <pb n="554"
                            xml:id="pg_554" facs="0654"/>in that country. In the opinion of this
                        Government, therefore, the Government of Turkey should be willing to grant
                        one or the other of these privileges and enforce a compliance with its
                        orders by the local authorities throughout the Empire.</p>
                    <p>The inclosed correspondence will enable you to fully and carefully present
                        this subject to the Government of the Porte. This you “will accordingly do,
                        and endeavor to obtain through the adoption of one of the courses suggested
                        above, or some other equally satisfactory method, recognition of the
                        competent diplomas issued by the American college at Beirut to its medical
                        graduates.</p>
                    <p>This Government is disposed to admit that every country has the right to
                        prescribe the mode of recognition of medical practitioners within its
                        borders. While granting this, it is only reasonable to expect, therefore,
                        that any regulations governing in such cases should be fair and impartial
                        and not discriminate in favor of any one nationality. All that is demanded
                        in the interest of our citizens is that the rule adopted shall be uniform
                        and without any practical discrimination against duly graduated American
                        practitioners. Common justice and international intercourse alike suggest
                        that no other course should be recognized or permitted.</p>
                    <p>You will give this subject your earnest consideration, and, if possible,
                        press it to an early and equitable conclusion.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I respectfully beg to submit for your kind
                            consideration and such action as you may deem proper in the case a few
                            statements regarding the difficulties under which the American Medical
                            College in Beirut, the graduates, and Americans who wish to practice
                            medicine in this part of Turkey labor, with the earnest hope of
                            Americans in general, and the medical fraternity in Syria in particular,
                            that the Department may use its best influence with the Sublime Porte to
                            secure for them due consideration and fair treatment.</p>
                        <p>The medical department of the American Protestant College at Beirut was
                            established in 1867, under the general law of the State of New York, the
                            board of trustees consisting of the following distinguished and
                            philanthropic gentlemen: William A. Booth, William E. Dodge, David
                            Hoadley, Simeon B. Chittenden, of New York; Abner Kingman, and Joseph S.
                            Ropes, of Boston, Mass. In 1870, before the first class was ready to
                            graduate, application was made to the Sublime Porte, through the
                            American minister, Mr. MacVeagh, for an authorization to the college by
                            the Ottoman Government to confer medical diplomas which would be legal
                            in Turkey. The Porte referred this question to the imperial faculty of
                            medicine in Constantinople, which body declined to allow any school or
                            examining body but its own to confer diplomas in medicine, but promised
                            to recognize the Beirut school as a qualifying body, and to admit its
                            students to examination without further preparation. The Porte promised
                            further to defray the traveling expenses of the students, and to lodge
                            and board them in the imperial school pending their examination. Our
                            minister, Mr. MacVeagh, advised the college to accept this offer for the
                            time being, assuming that it was made in good faith, and pointing out
                            the difficulty and even impossibility of the Government’s overriding the
                            decision of its own medical faculty unless it were proved incapable or
                            corrupt in carrying out its decision. In no case, however, although
                            frequently applied to by indigent students, has the Government afforded
                            the slightest aid to any student in going or returning nor given them
                            board and lodging, as promised. Soon after the announcement, of this
                            decision the Ottoman Government began to send menacing communications to
                            the college and stringent orders to the governments of Syria and Lebanon
                            for the prevention of the unlicensed practice of medicine. During the
                            last <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0655"/>two years there has been a
                            disposition on the part of the Turkish authorities in Syria to enforce
                            the regulations that require all persons to present their diplomas in
                            person and undergo an examination before the Imperial Medical College at
                            Constantinople before being permitted to practice medicine in
                            Turkey.</p>
                        <p>No one will deny the right of the Turkish Government to pass such laws,
                            but the strange part of the laws and regulations regarding this matter
                            is that they have been only enforced against American citizens who hold
                            diplomas from American colleges and natives who have graduated at the
                            American college in Beirut. No German, French, English, Italian,
                            Austrian, nor any other foreigner practicing medicine has in any
                            instance been molested by the Turkish authorities in Syria, while
                            American doctors have been harassed, insulted, prohibited from
                            practicing, and forced to go to Constantinople to pass an examination
                            before the board of the Imperial Medical College there.</p>
                        <p>At the request of Mr. Heap, United States consul-general at
                            Constantinople, I collected and furnished him during July last, at
                            considerable trouble and expense, with a list of the names and
                            residences of four hundred and eighty-two doctors practicing medicine in
                            my consular district. I find that over four hundred of the number have
                            no diplomas from the Imperial Medical College at Constantinople, mostly
                            natives, and over three hundred have no diplomas from any college, never
                            having studied medicine. I have called the attention of the
                            governor-general of Syria to these facts, but no notice has yet been
                            taken of the subject, nor is it likely that any will be given by the
                            Turkish authorities to the matter. Dr. Skandarani, the chief municipal
                            and sanitary physician of Damascus, the second city in the Empire, has
                            never studied in any medical school, nor has he a diploma from any
                            educating body. It is impossible for these ignorant native practitioners
                            to pass an examination before a medical board, but no one here believes
                            that they will be prohibited from practicing or in any way molested by
                            the Turkish authorities. They may get diplomas, however, by paying the
                            required fee, 7 Turkish pounds. In 1877 Dr. Post, of the faculty of the
                            medical college of Beirut, spent several months at Constantinople
                            endeavoring to obtain more favorable conditions for the graduates of the
                            college. He received promises, but these pledges have been entirely
                            ignored by the Imperial College. I am informed that in every case the
                            candidates from Beirut college proved themselves capable of passing the
                            examination at Constantinople, and, though they have been subject to
                            many annoyances, they finally received diplomas which made no mention,
                            however, of their studies in the American school at Beirut, but their
                            Beirut college certificates have been confiscated. Drs. Bliss, Van Dyck,
                            Post, Dennis, and other Americans have devoted many years of their lives
                            to establishing the Protestant Medical College in Beirut, while large
                            sums of money have been spent in buying ground and erecting suitable
                            buildings, which are second to none in the country; but all this will
                            prove comparatively futile unless proper concessions be granted to the
                            college by the Ottoman Government. The instructions have lately been
                            changed from the Arabic language to English in the medical department.
                            The college is in a flourishing condition, having two hundred students,
                            a considerable number of whom are studying medicine. The faculty request
                            and hope for one of the following privileges: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>

                                    and sealed by the Imperial College officials.</item>

                                <item>Failing in either of these, the appointment of an examining

                                    after they have passed a satisfactory examination before the
                                    said board, which certificate will authorize the holder to
                                    practice medicine anywhere in the Ottoman Empire.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The course of instruction and standard of examinations in the college
                            will be seen, from the inclosed catalogue, to be thorough, and the many
                            graduates of the college now engaged in Government service or occupying
                            high positions as private practitioners in the east have established its
                            reputation on a firm basis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Heap, our consul-general at Constantinople, has endeavored to get the
                            Imperial Medical College to accept the diplomas of Americans who desire
                            to practice medicine in Turkey (without having the parties appear in
                            person to undergo an examination before the Imperial College), and after
                            having their diplomas registered, to grant them permission or license to
                            practice medicine in the Ottoman Empire, but in this he has not
                            succeeded. It is in the interest of Americans in this part of Turkey and
                            the American Medical College here that I have presumed to address yon
                            this dispatch, with the sincere hope that the Department of State may
                            use it best influence with the Sublime Porte to have it grant one of the
                            three privileges desired by the American Protestant Medical College in

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to Mr Robeson’s dispatch to the
                            Department of State, No. 67, dated January 18, 1884, inclosed herewith,
                            I beg to say that what he states in regard to the examination and
                            licensing of the graduates from the American College of Medicine at
                            Beirut deserves the earnest consideration of the Department. The efforts
                            made here, whether by the legation or the consulate-general, to obtain
                            some relaxation of the stringent rules of the faculty of medicine in
                            their favor have been unsuccessful. It is true that no difficulty has
                            been experienced in obtaining the license to practice when the candidate
                            has presented himself for examination with a diploma duly certified to
                            by the consul-general, whether it was granted by the college at Beirut
                            or a medical college in the United States, and upon payment of the
                            established fees to the Turkish faculty. The Porte appears to have taken
                            stringent measures to prevent unauthorized persons from practicing in
                            the provinces; but these measures do not seem to have been attended with
                            success.</p>
                        <p>If a decree were obtained recognizing the validity of diplomas issued by
                            the American college at Beirut, after registration here, without the
                            presence of the candidate, and after the payment of the fees, which we
                            have reason to believe is the principal concern of the College of
                            Medicine of Constantinople, the ground of complaint would be
                            lessened.</p>
                        <p>The examination or <hi rend="italic">colloquium</hi> is a mere
                            formality.</p>
                        <p>It may be well to state that no fee is charged at this consulate for the
                            certification of diplomas.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of
                        your dispatch No. 157, of February 29, 1884, relative to my note to the
                        Sublime Porte offering to accede to its request for lists of American
                        citizens in Turkey upon conditions named.</p>
                    <p>The views you were pleased to present therein in support of objections to the
                        concession as proposed, are certainly unanswerable, and while it is true
                        that it was not in my mind to make a consular certificate of citizenship
                        take the place of a formal passport, or leave the list furnished by the
                        legation determinative of all who might be entitled to protection as
                        citizens, the points you present have given me new light upon the subject.
                        In fact my faith in the possibility of gaining the object aimed
                        at—reservation to consuls of right to determine questions of citizenship to
                        the exclusion of Turkish authorities—is so shaken by your paper that instead
                        of remodeling my note, as you kindly suggest, I have taken the liberty of
                        altogether withdrawing the proposals presented to the Sublime Porte. The
                        note of withdrawal is herewith inclosed.</p>
                    <p>Being satisfied that this is at least the safest course, I venture to hope it
                        will meet your approval.</p>

                            the receipt from the imperial ministry of foreign affairs of a circular
                            note relative to the inscription of American citizens resident in the
                            Empire and to assure the said ministry of its willingness to comply with
                            the desires expressed therein upon certain conditions.</p>
                        <p>The reply of the legation is contained in a <hi rend="italic">note

                        <p>The legation begs to say now that further consideration of the subject
                            has disclosed the great inconveniency, if not absolute impossibility, of
                            such compliance, due regard being had to the laws of the United States,
                            to regulations of long standing there under, and to a prudent
                            conservatism with, respect to rights of American citizens in the

                        <p>The legation of the United States therefore withdraws its offers

                            deters conclusions on the subject.</p>
                        <p>The imperial ministry of foreign affairs not having as yet signified
                            acceptance of the conditions proposed by the legation, it may be
                            presumed that the deferment herein announced will not be provocative of
                            any inconvenience.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your telegraphic instruction
                        relative to compromising the petroleum concession dispute, it will be
                        recalled that a compromise, if effected, was to be without special advantage
                        to dealers in the Russian article.</p>
                    <p>Acting under the instruction and pursuing the line of conduct indicated in my
                        dispatch to the Department, No. 351, I have the honor now to forward a copy
                        of a note transmitted to the Sublime Porte day before yesterday, and to
                        remark that it is identical with a note delivered at the same time by Mr.
                        Nelidow, the Russian ambassador.</p>
                    <p>You will please observe that while the paper is quite energetic in tone, it
                        nevertheless leaves a door open to compromise upon the basis to reduction of
                        storage charges. That in fact is the end aimed at by the identic
                        presentment. A proposition to settle without some new and decided turn given
                        the affair would have been simple waste of time. Moreover, a compromise, if
                        accomplished now, will be with the Russians conjointly, and upon terms of
                        absolute equality. I could see no better mode of obtaining this latter
                        point, and of putting an end to sales from the decks of small vessels, a
                        practice so ruinous to our interests, than by square co-operation with my
                        colleague in the manner here indicated.</p>

                        <p>The legation of the United States had the honor to repeatedly declare
                            most emphatically, by its notes and verbally, that it could not accept
                            the views of the Sublime Porte relative to the right of monopoly granted
                            to the depots of petroleum of Sami Bey, at Tchiboukei, and to the taxes
                            levied on this account by the concessionary.</p>
                        <p>The United States legation in demonstrating that the taxes in question
                            constituted an onerous charge on the commerce of petroleum and gave rise
                            to just complaints on the part of American importers, requested amongst
                            other things that the company of Sami Bey be required to reduce them to
                            an equitable rate, failing in which the legation of the United States
                            reserved to American importers to avail themselves of the right to
                            establish their own depots in conformity with the exigencies of public
                            security, without prejudice, however, to the question of indemnities to
                            be claimed for the exhorbitant dues arbitrarily exacted of them.</p>
                        <p>Until now, notwithstanding the importance of this question as regards the
                            commercial interests involved, no sufficient answer has been given by
                            the Sublime Porte to the legitimate complaints of the legation, nor has
                            it been informed of the result of the deliberations of the commission
                                <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> appointed at the Sublime Porte,
                            although it has made its report some time since.</p>
                        <p>The legation of the United States cannot insist too earnestly on the
                            urgency of regulating, without further delay and in a satisfactory
                            manner, this question whose international character is so clear; in
                            fact, the régime to which the commerce in petoleum is now subjected is a
                            direct violation of the stipulations of the treaties and the
                            capitulations in vigor, in virtue of which articles of importation into
                            Turkey are liable to a fixed customs duty only and cannot be subjected
                            to any other imposition. The Sublime Porte will be pleased to
                            acknowledge that the motive for the storage of petroleum, which is an
                            inflamable matter, being altogether for considerations of public
                            security, should not be made a source of revenue for the state, and
                            still less for a private company. Therefore the tax levied on this
                            account should be in strict proportion with the expenses of installation
                            and the maintenance of the depots.</p>
                        <p>Any sum levied over and above the amount necessary for this purpose
                            constitutes an absolutely illegal charge. Such is manifestly the case as
                            regards the tax collected by Sami Bey, which, according to the data
                            collected by the legation, amounts to nearly the treble of the sum to
                            which he might claim to cover his expenses and have a reasonable
                            profit.</p>
                        <p>As regards the article of the regulation of the port of Constantinople
                            prescribing the storage of petroleum in a depot fitted up with a view to
                            public security, it cannot be quoted in support of the pretension of
                            Sami Bey, as it was only with the consideration in view that the
                            representatives of the powers gave their assent to that article, and
                            most assuredly it was not with the intention of creating a new source of
                            taxes and an onerous monopoly for commerce.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, and considering the increasing importance of the commerce of
                            petroleum for the United States, it is the duty of the United States
                            legation to protest against the present state of things, which is unjust
                            as it is injurious to the interests of its commerce, and to demand
                            prompt redress for the losses it has sustained.</p>
                        <p>In case the Ottoman Government should not, without delay, cause the taxes
                            collected by Sami Bey &amp; Co. to be reduced to an equitable rate, to
                            be established in concert with the powers interested, the American
                            legation will find itself under the necessity of insisting upon the
                            indisputable right of American merchants to establish depots of
                            petroleum of their own under more favorable conditions, as well as to
                            require an indemnity for what may be due them for the violation, as
                            regards them, of the liberty of commerce.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In the affair of Messrs. Knapp and Reynolds, I
                        have the honor to report some advance toward an end.</p>
                    <p>The Sublime Porte has been induced at last to dismiss the governor <pb
                            n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0659"/>of Bitlis. That you may be able to
                        form an opinion as to how far that is likely to forward the business, I take
                        the liberty of inclosing a copy of a letter received yesterday from Mr.
                        Knapp. For my part, I fear the step comes too late to give hopes of the
                        punishment of Moussa Bey.</p>
                    <p>The new governor may have the best intentions, and may go out fully energized
                        by orders, and yet fail.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Sir</hi>: I received 7th instant your
                            unexpected letter of 20th ultimo, in which you speak of having changed
                            the demand from the Imperial Government, in relation to Moussa Bey, to
                            one of money. Allow me to inquire whether this is an unconditional
                            demand.</p>
                        <p>Suppose the officials here choose to deliver up Moussa Bey, shall you
                            insist upon the payment of the indemnification notwithstanding?</p>
                        <p>On the day your letter arrived, I was told that several days previous our
                            governor-general received two most inexorable orders from the minister
                            of foreign affairs to attend to this matter at once; but that he laid by
                            the papers, affecting no concern; about it. I have received a letter
                            from Dr. Reynolds, of Van, of February 26th, in which he states he was
                            the day before cited by the officials to answer some questions with
                            reference to this case, which were sent, they said, from Bitlis. He
                            referred them to Mr. Eyres, Her Britanic Majesty’s consul, as his
                            representative.</p>
                        <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I am now credibly informed that, on October 22, the day I identified
                            Moussa Bey as the assailant, his father, Meza Bey, was in town, and that
                            he paid the officials a bribe of £200 (T.), and the result was that his
                            son was allowed to return home; that subsequently to this, on hearing
                            that the affair was still being followed up, he resolved to take £400
                            (T.) in cash, and sixty botmans (1,000 pounds) of butter and bring here,
                            with a few friends as mediators, present me in person the above, kiss my
                            hand, and secure my forgiveness; but that, when he arrived here with his
                            money, the voli and other officials, hearing of his intention, persuaded
                            him to desist, which he did, they assuring him that nothing more would
                            come of it.</p>
                        <p>I am furthermore informed—I cannot vouch for its accuracy—that on October
                            22, when Mussa Bey was brought before me, and I then stated, “That is
                            the man,” the scribe wrote, “This resembles the man.” Be this as it may,
                            it is certainly in keeping with what is really being done to thwart
                            justice.</p>
                        <p>I sincerely hope that you will be able to secure the sum demanded, for I
                            am sure the recovery of it will have a greater moral effect than the
                            imprisonment of the assailants in comparison, for life is held of little
                            account among the twenty or more Kurdish clans in this vilayet.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, what are we to do in regard to the future? I am informed that
                            there were over a dozen murders, mostly for money, say nothing of the
                            many wounded and robbed, in this vicinity last summer. If there shall
                            continue the same degree of anarchy here as last summer, I fear we shall
                            not be wholly without apprehension about our personal safety.</p>
                        <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>I send to-day a copy of your letter to Dr. Reynolds.</p>
                        <p>Thanking you for your noble efforts in our behalf,</p>
                        <p>I am, &amp;c.,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your No. 350, of the 12th ultimo, in further
                        reference to the question of certain persons, of Russian origin, domiciled
                        in Jerusalem, and claiming to be citizens of the United States, has been
                        received.</p>
                    <p>My No. 162 to you, of the 25th ultimo, anticipated in some points a reply to
                        your present dispatch.</p>
                    <p>It appears that the Turkish Government disclaims intention to interfere with
                        any persons who may show that they have duly acquired the status of citizens
                        of the United States, and that it merely seeks to call the attention of the
                        legation to the irregular case of persons within Turkish jurisdiction, who,
                        “without ever having been in America, claim the privileges of American
                        citizens.”</p>
                    <p>It seems unnecessary to discuss the broad contention on which the Sublime
                        Porte rests its argument, that no change of allegiance can be made unless
                        the person affected be actually an emigrant to and resident in the country
                        of his allegiance. It is sufficient for the purposes of the present question
                        that the laws of the United States contemplate such actual presence and
                        residence within their jurisdiction, and it is the effect of naturalization
                        under those laws that we must take as a starting point, and not a general
                        theorem which may involve the right of the person to change his
                        allegiance.</p>
                    <p>To make this point clearer, the Porte claims that the persons in question
                        “have at no time made a sojourn in the United States, and the naturalization
                        they claim to have obtained being but fictitious and delusive, the Sublime
                        Porte cannot recognize them.” Granting that the conclusion is correct, the
                        fictitious and delusive character of the alleged naturalization would have
                        to be determined with respect to the naturalization laws of the United
                        States, and not in conformity with a theoretical declaration of the Turkish
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>Inasmuch as this contention of the Porte coincides in fact with our
                        naturalization laws as to those persons, natives of a third country, who may
                        never have taken the lawful steps to become citizens of the United States,
                        that is, as to persons of the “first class,” described in your previous
                        dispatch No. 315, of January 24, 1884, your reply to his excellency Aarifi,
                        of March 12, and your instructions to the consul at Jerusalem are approved,
                        so far as that class of persons is concerned.</p>
                    <p>As to the “third class” you describe, those fully naturalized, there can be
                        no doubt of their rights, and of the Porte’s entire willingness to recognize
                        those rights.</p>
                    <p>The “second class” embracing persons who, having taken out their first papers
                        conformably to our law, may be found thereafter in Turkish jurisdiction,
                        does not appear to be touched by the minister’s reply, unless his delaration
                        that “he Imperial Government must continue to consider as Turkish subjects
                        the former Russian subjects mentioned” is to be construed as applying to
                        such persons. My No. 162, of the 25th ultimo, will have shown you that I
                        take some pains to reserve any partial rights which an alien may acquire by
                        declaring his intention to become a citizen of the United States. It is not
                        thought likely that any specific case will present this issue, and you may
                        not now need to do more than generally reserve it. But if a case should
                        arise, you will claim that the <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0661"
                        />person affected shall not be deemed to have become a subject of the Porte
                        until after he shall have had full option to avail himself of his previous
                        declaration of intention and to complete his naturalization conformably to
                        our laws.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your dispatch No. 169, touching
                        rights of American practitioners of medicine in Turkey, and the concessions
                        considered desirable in behalf of graduates of the American Medical College
                        at Beirut, I beg to say that I have read your comments upon the subject, and
                        the papers of Consul Robeson and Consul-General Heap, with great interest.
                        It will of course give me pleasure to <hi rend="italic">renew</hi> my
                        efforts to obtain one or other of the three points stated as satisfactory to
                        the college authorities.</p>
                    <p>It would not be just to me to leave you under inference that I have not
                        already tried to do this service for that very creditable institution. I
                        have made the attempt repeatedly, though informally, and always with
                        reference to the correspondence on the subject had between the Porte and my
                        predecessors.</p>
                    <p>It may be useful also to inform you of the difficulties in the way, a branch
                        of the subject upon which the consular papers are silent.</p>
                    <p>The Porte holds, in the first place, that the college is not a Turkish
                        institution.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>In the next place, the imperial college is jealous of its rights and
                        reputation. In its department of science, it is of great influence with the
                        authorities at the Porte. It even forms a kind of quasi bureau. Things
                        pertinent to surgery and medicine that come before the Porte are referred to
                        its faculty for opinion and report.</p>
                    <p>With this in mind, you can readily see that any one of the three points
                        submitted as agreeable to the Beirut administration will have to be carried
                        over the heads of their imperial brethren of Constantinople.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>In the third place, the Porte looks with unfriendly eyes at the proposal to
                        confer special privileges upon the American college, because it has an
                        appearance of interference with the internal affairs of the Empire. In
                        reading your dispatch I was struck with the fact that you seem to regard the
                        Beirut graduates as Americans. They are natives of the country and Ottoman
                        subjects.</p>
                    <p>The parental regard the Sublime Porte believes it has for its own people is
                        tacitly impeached by requests for favors presented by foreigners on the
                        ground of solicitude for the welfare of those people.</p>
                    <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0662"/>
                    <p>In the last place, the most insuperable objection lies in the unwillingness
                        of the Porte to do anything to sustain a foreign college of whatever kind in
                        Turkey. Within six weeks past a permit was refused authorizing the founding
                        of a medical college at Beirut under the auspices of the Jesuits, although
                        the application was pressed zealously by the Marquis de Noailles, my
                        colleague of France.</p>
                    <p>Doubtless you inferred from Consul Robeson’s dispatch that there were other
                        foreign medical colleges in Turkey, and that the Porte was discriminating in
                        their favor. It is but just to say that there are but two medical colleges
                        proper in this country, the Imperial College at Constantinople and the
                        American at Beirut. There may be a medical department in the American
                        college at Harpoot.</p>
                    <p>So that altogether the prospect of success in the business by direct
                        application to the Porte is not encouraging. Not impossibly I may do better
                        by trying to interest the Sultan in it. I shall watch an opportunity to
                        present it to him.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my dispatch to the Department,
                        No. 358, and to the note (a copy of which was therein inclosed) forwarded to
                        the Sublime Porte after agreement with my colleague, the Russian ambassador,
                        I have now the honor to transmit for your information a copy and a
                        translation of the reply received thereto. * * *</p>
                    <p>The reservation contained in the next to last clause of the paper, of a right
                        to review the work of the commission with a view to lessening the storage
                        charges at present collected under the concession, means, when literally
                        interpreted, that the council of ministers will now undertake a reduction in
                        the way of compromise. Accordingly, among the last acts of the late minister
                        of foreign affairs, Aarifi Pasha, was a reference of the identic note to the
                        council, with an earnest recommendation that the charge be reduced to 70
                        paras the case.</p>
                    <p>When I heard of the return to office of Assim Pasha, I paid the new official
                        a congratulatory visit. This was done yesterday. I found his excellency
                        friendly to the compromise; he even volunteered to exert himself to have the
                        council take the matter up at its next meeting. That meeting was held
                        yesterday.</p>
                    <p>From the office of the minister of foreign affairs I went next to that, of
                        the minister of the interior. The latter official made no concealment of his
                        position. He was most pronounced in advocacy of a compromise, and agreed to
                        join his excellency Assim Pasha in pushing the affair at the next
                        council.</p>

                        <p>The ministry of foreign affairs has received the <hi rend="italic">note
                                verbale</hi> the United States legation did it the honor to address
                            it the 24th of last March, No. 208, relative to the petroleum depots of
                            Tchiboukei.</p>
                        <p>The Sublime Porte regrets not to be able to regard this question from the
                            same point of view as the United States legation. In its eyes the
                            establishment of the depots presents no international character and does
                            not attack commercial liberty.</p>
                        <p>It concerns a measure of internal order and public security that the
                            territorial Government evidently has the right to settle for itself by
                            observing the interests of everybody.</p>
                        <p>It could not therefore recognize the right of importers either to
                            establish depots or to claim indemnification.</p>
                        <p>However, while maintaining the standpoint it has already developed
                            concerning the the point of right, the Sublime Porte did not omit
                            examining the objections to which the tariff in force might give rise.
                            The question was referred to a special commission, which has recorded in
                            a report the result of its deliberations. The Sublime Porte reserves to
                            itself the examinations of this work to ascertain if it be necessary or
                            not to lower the dues at present collected.</p>
                        <p>The United States legation may be sure that the Imperial Government has
                            given this affair the most serious attention, and that its greatest
                            desire is to conciliate all interests engaged.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your No. 381, of the 25th ultimo, has been
                        received. It is difficult to see what further steps can be presently taken
                        to press the case of Messrs. Knapp and Reynolds. No more positive assurances
                        could be asked or given than those furnished to you by the minister for
                        foreign affairs that every effort is in progress to procure the arrest of
                        Moussa Bey, and that the delinquent officials concerned in the previous
                        failure of justice in this regard have been removed.</p>
                    <p>The statement of Mr. Eyres, British vice-consul at Yan, that “zaptiehs were
                        sent to arrest him, but Moussa Bey refused to accompany them, and the
                        zaptiehs returned without effecting their purpose” is not inconsistent with
                        a possibility that the arresting party may not have been strong enough to
                        attempt the seizure of Moussa by force at his own residence.</p>
                    <p>Further events can only determine whether any fresh proofs of delinquency in
                        the proceedings against Moussa are to be added to those of which we already
                        think we have such good cause to complain. It is very desirable that you
                        should continue to receive, in a friendly way, such information touching
                        events at Bitlis as the British vice-consul may chance to report, and I have
                        no doubt that Lord Dufferin will, in this respect, continue to extend to you
                        his marked courtesy, which this Government highly appreciates.</p>

                            of America and Turkey, which your excellency reminds me, has been
                            denounced by the Sublime Porte.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency is pleased also to observe that subsequently a
                            provisional convention was proposed to the legation of the United States
                            for the prolongation of this instrument, but, as no agreement was come

                            1884.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency is good enough to remark in conclusion that it is your
                            duty to inform me of this fact, as the inauguration of a new system of
                            customs dues is near at hand.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency is aware that a protocol was proposed to his excellency
                            Tevfik Pasha, the Ottoman minister at Washington, by the Department of
                            State, on the 21st of March last, in view of the intention of the
                            Imperial Ottoman Government to denounce the treaty of the 25th of
                            February, 1862. This protocol was rejected.</p>
                        <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0667"/>
                        <p>The object of the protocol was to place the two Governments on a footing
                            of equality with regard to other Governments, and its principal
                            stipulation is to the effect that they shall reciprocally enjoy the
                            rights granted to other most favored nations. These provisions being
                            eminently just and equitable it was reasonable to entertain the
                            expectation that they would be found acceptable by the Imperial
                            Government, particularly as they were intended to bridge over the
                            inconvenience of a period of transition between the denunciation of the
                            existing treaty of commerce and the negotiation of a new one.</p>
                        <p>However, in the view of the Government of the United States the treaty of
                            1882 is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> duly ended, but if the Imperial
                            Government maintains its intention of denouncing that treaty, I am
                            instructed to declare to your excellency that the United States
                            Government falls back on the treaty concluded between our two respective
                            Governments in 1830, which remains in full force and effect in all its
                            parts after the expiration of the treaty of 1862.</p>

                        Pflaum, and may thus be deemed a recession from his extreme ground that the
                        treatment of Dr. Pflaum was justified at every step.</p>

                    <p>If the Government of the Porte should find that the Turkish execution of the
                        sentence was justifiable, you will protest against the same as an undeniable
                        violation of article 4 of the treaty of 1830.</p>

                        396, of the 4th ultimo, concerning the denunciation of the treaty of 1862 by
                        the Sublime Porte, and your note to the minister for foreign affairs
                        reserving all rights of this Government under the treaty of 1830.</p>
                    <p>In your note to Assim Pasha you appear to have met the implication of the
                        Porte that its proposal to establish a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>,
                        under the treaty of 1862, had been unsuccessful through our failure to come
                        to an agreement. The protocol submitted by this Government was in response
                        to the Porte’s general and unformulated proposal, and it was rejected
                        without being, as would appear, ever considered or being deemed to merit the
                        submission of a counter-draft; neither does Tevfik Pasha’s note of rejection
                        even show in what respects it was unacceptable nor suggest any
                        amendment.</p>

                        14th instant, from the corresponding secretary of the American Bible Society
                        at New York, to whom the information imparted by your dispatch No. 402, of
                        the 19th ultimo, was communicated. Mr. Gilman refers in his letter to two
                        recent cases occurring at Constantinople, where the customs authorities have
                        so far declined to pass the Bibles ordered from Beirut, on the ground that
                        the books are printed in Arabic and cannot easily be read by the officials.
                        They are uncertain, therefore, whether the Bibles are what they purport to
                        be.</p>
                    <p>Whatever may be necessary to facilitate the passage of these books, provided
                        they have not been passed upon the receipt of this instruction, you will

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I take this early opportunity to express
                            my thanks for the information contained in your communication addressed
                            to me, under date of July 11, and for the promptness with which the
                            instructions of the Department were given to the minister at
                            Constantinople, in respect to matters which had led the American Bible
                            Society, to invoke the kind offices of the Government.</p>
                        <p>I cannot forbear, however, to express the conviction that something more
                            is needed to secure for the society and its agents, even in the capital
                            of the Empire, the rights of American citizens engaged in lawful trade.
                            An illustration of this is contained in a letter which I have just
                            received from Constantinople, written ten days after the date of Mr.
                            Heap’s dispatch No. 402. My correspondent says, “Two cases of Arabic
                            Bibles and Testaments which I ordered from Beirut some months ago, and
                            which have been in the custom-house here for seven weeks, although
                            having the regular papers and pronounced, over and over again, all good
                            and harmless, are not yet given up. If we in the capital suffer such
                            things you can imagine the state of things in the interior. We hope in
                            the end to get our books, but the whole thing is an outrage.” We
                            understand the excuse in this case to be that, as the books are in
                            Arabic, the officials cannot read them well, and that they are not sure
                            they are what they purport to be.</p>
                        <p>We are thankful to learn that in the case of the colporteur who was
                            arrested near Smyrna some months ago our consul, Mr. Stevens, took very
                            energetic measures, which resulted not only in the release of the man,
                            but in the issue by the Government of a paper which will protect him in
                            future.</p>
                        <p>With renewed thanks for the courtesy we have uniformly received from the
                            Department, I am, &amp;c.,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inclose copies of a note
                        from the Earl of Dufferin dated the 14th instant, with its inclosures, and
                        of my reply to the same; also a copy of a letter from the Rev. Mr. Herrick,
                        a missionary residing here, concerning the difficulties and obstructions
                        thrown in the way of the American missionaries in Armenia by the local
                        authorities in the smaller towns and villages to prevent the sale of their
                        books.</p>
                    <p>This is a frequent cause of complaint on the part of the missionaries, not
                        only in the smaller towns in the interior, as stated in this correspondence,
                        but also in the larger cities, not excepting Constantinople. This opposition
                        to the sale of these books comes in part from the Armenians, particularly
                        the clergy, who have considerable influence in Asia Minor, and who look upon
                        them as the cause of the conversion of many of their people to
                        Protestantism, and in part from the Turks themselves who believe that it is
                        owing to the teachings of the missionaries through their publications that
                        so many young Armenians emigrate to America, and after obtaining
                        naturalization return here and claim the protection of the United States.
                        The Turkish Government is beginning to refuse recognition of the foreign
                        naturalization of their subjects who have left their country without
                        permission. This is the case with nearly all the <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570"
                            facs="0670"/>Armenians who go to the United States. Hence they have
                        frequent trouble with the authorities on their return.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Everett, Her Majesty’s consul at Erzeroum, takes a sensible view of
                        the question, and the missionaries would do wisely in following his
                        advice.</p>
                    <p>It is extremely difficult, in the present disposition at the Porte towards
                        our missionaries in Armenia, to induce the minister of foreign affairs to
                        send categorical and energetic orders to the governors and sub-governors in
                        the provinces to respect and protect their rights—orders that are meant to
                        be obeyed. There is a strong occult Armenian influence at the Porte which
                        renders it difficult to effect a satisfactory settlement of any question in
                        which an Armenian is involved.</p>
                    <p>As we have no consular representative in those distant and extensive regions,
                        throughout which so many Americans are scattered, I was glad to avail myself
                        of Lord Dufferin’s very courteous offer to instruct the British consuls
                        there to look after their interests.</p>

                            authorities, and suggests that it might be conducive to their better
                            treatment if certified copies of the firman granted to the Protestant
                            subjects of the Sublime Porte by Sultan Medjid, accompanied by atrict
                            orders to maintain its provisions, were sent by the Erzeroum government
                            to the various local authorities of that vilayet.</p>

                            the Empire, I venture to suggest that it might be conducive to much
                            additional advantage if the Porte were officially informed that British
                            consuls are instructed to extend their protection to Americans whenever

                        <p>“Colonel Everett has told Mr. Chambers, of Erzeroum, that American
                            subjects have been placed under British protection, but the Porte and
                            the volis have not been informed of it, and that the American legation
                            should give the necessary information.”</p>
                        <p>Would it suit your view of the case to officially inform Dr. Barnum and
                            other American citizens remote from American consuls, that they are to
                            apply to British consuls, and also to request the Turkish Goverment to
                            so notify the volis?</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lord</hi>: I have the honor to inclose herewith
                            the copy of a letter which I have received from the Rev. R. Chambers, an
                            American missionary stationed at this place.</p>
                        <p>In presenting it to me Mr. Chambers begged that I would bring his request
                            to the notice of your excellency, whose kind offices he solicits. At the
                            same time he is writing to his chiefs at Constantinople, requesting them
                            to call the attention of his excellency, the American minister, to the
                            grievous restraints which are being placed on the mission at the present
                            time by the local authorities.</p>
                        <p>These restraints, Mr. Chambers informs me, comprise the mutilation, and
                            in some cases, confiscation, of their books by the education department
                            here, although these books have already passed the censorship at
                            Constantinople, a prohibition to sell any of them except in the
                            principal towns, under the penalty of imprisonment, detention in jail of
                            their agents in the sub-provinces by the local governors, and
                            confiscation of the books found upon them, a growing tendency to ignore
                            the Protestants as a separate community, and in fact every sort of
                            annoyance that can be devised.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Chambers appears to have formed an opinion that some of these evils
                            might be lessened if it were more generally known in the sub-provinces
                            that a Protestant firman exists.</p>
                        <p>It is probable that in many of the cazas the sub-governors have no
                            knowledge of the existence of a Protestant firman, and that in many
                            others there is entire ignorance of its terms, but it is doubtful
                            whether there would be any amelioration of the condition of the
                            Protestants, even if the governors of the cazas mentioned by Mr.
                            Chambers were so provided, I base this opinion on the ground that the
                            rights of the Protestants are well known to the authorities by whom the
                            books are mutilated and confiscated, and from whom the instructions
                            proceed restricting their sale. An order from the Sublime Porte
                            reminding the authorities here of the rights acquired by the Protestants
                            through the firman and enjoining them to take care that in future this
                            community should be in no way molested, would be, perhaps, more
                            efficacious.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Sir</hi>: Great Britain has been the chief
                            instrument in the Divine hand for the establishment and maintenance of
                            the principles of religious liberty in this, as in many other countries.
                            The firman which secures the rights and liberties of the <pb n="572"
                                xml:id="pg_572" facs="0672"/>Protestant subjects of the Porte was
                            obtained from the Sultan Abdul Medjid by the good offices of the British
                            Government, which has never remitted its efforts for obtaining equal
                            rights for all classes of the subjects of this Empire.</p>
                        <p>I am very sorry to have to say that the provisions of the above-mentioned
                            firman are often ignored or imperfectly acknowledged in many of the
                            provinces of the Erzeroum vilayet, which state of things may, I think,
                            be accounted for, in part, on the supposition that the firman and its
                            provisions are generally unknown.</p>
                        <p>May I ask you kindly to consider whether it would not be conducive to
                            good results in many ways that certified copies of the firman,
                            accompanied also by strict injunctions from the Erzeroum government to
                            the various local governors and officials, be sent to the following
                            seats of local government, viz: Erziugen, Kemakh, Momakhotun, Kasaba
                            (Keghi), Khanous, Hassankalsh, Toprakkalsb, Kora, Kilissa, and Bayazid.
                            At the present time offenses against liberty of conscience are being
                            committed in Khanous and Keghi—offenses the possibility of the
                            occurrence of which emphasizes the need of some such steps as those
                            which I have above indicated.</p>
                        <p>Your kind attention to this request will confer another lasting favor
                            upon many of the subjects of this Empire.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lord</hi>: I had barely written my dispatch No.
                            28, of the 26th ultimo, before I received another communication from Mr.
                            Chambers, in which he stated that a number of books which had been
                            seized by the authorities at Khanous were detained by the censor here,
                            who refused to deliver them up unless the colporteur on whom they were
                            found signed a declaration to the effect that he would not again sell
                            any books except in the chief towns of the sub-provinces of the
                            vilayet.</p>
                        <p>Believing that I might be able to render Mr. Chambers some assistance in
                            this matter without going beyond my instructions, I directed Mr. Devey
                            to see the censor, and if he refused to give up the books to call on the
                            voli. The censor refusing, Mr. Devey called upon the voli, who at once
                            ordered the books to be returned. They were given back the next day.</p>
                        <p>During Mr. Devey’s interview with the voli his excellency pointed out
                            that he had received an order from Constantinople, applicable to all
                            communities, that in future no books of any kind were to be sold except
                            in the chief towns or villages of the sanjaks, cazas, and mahichs of the
                            vilayet.</p>
                        <p>No doubt this order is a certain restriction to the Protestants who have
                            always been in the habit of hawking their hooks about in the villages,
                            but, on the other hand, the Government may have good reason for
                            controlling the sale of books at the present time, and it certainly
                            could not be expected that the Protestants should he placed on a more
                            advantageous footing in this respect than the other Christian
                            communities.</p>
                        <p>For the present I have recommended Mr. Chambers to instruct his agents to
                            comply strictly with the existing orders, and I have also advised him to
                            court the examination of his books, and have them all stamped with the
                            seal of the vilayet, before being issued to the colporteur for sale, and
                            whether or no they may have passed the censorship at Constantinople.</p>
                        <p>By such measures, it appears to me, he will not only entirely avoid
                            collision with the authorities, but he will be likely to gain their
                            respect and confidence.</p>

                        214, dated the:28th of May and 17th July respectively, relative to the
                        restriction on the sale of the American Bible Society’s books, and more
                        especially to <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0673"/>the detention by the

                        inform you that the minister of public instruction directed the custom-house
                        on the 4th of July last to deliver these books to their owner or
                        consignee.</p>
                    <p>It is to be regretted that in the interior as well as here the authorities,
                        particularly the subordinate and more illiterate ones, through misdirected
                        or ignorant zeal, interfere so often with the colporteurs of the Bible
                        Society although they are duly licensed and the books they have for sale
                        have passed the censorship. The superior authorities appear to disapprove of
                        the arbitrary acts of their subordinates, but do not seem able to prevent
                        them, and when a seizure of books takes place they allow so many delays and
                        formalities to be interposed that much time usually elapses before redress
                        can be obtained.</p>
                    <p>The old time rough and ready justice of the pashas, who received examined and
                        gave decisions on complaints in a single sitting, had its advantages, but
                        all this is changed and the celerity of Turkish legal procedure exists only
                        in tradition.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your No.
                        414, of the 18th ultimo, respecting the protection of American citizens in
                        Asia Minor (Armenia) by British consuls, and to inform you that the
                        Department was exceedingly gratified to learn of the very courteous offer
                        made by Lord Dufferin, Her Britannic Majesty’s representative at
                        Constantinople, in reference to the protection by British consular officers
                        of the rights of American citizens engaged in the sale of books in those
                        distant regions of Turkey remote from our consular representatives.</p>
                    <p>The occasion for such protection seems to have arisen on account of
                        restrictions placed upon the sale of books by the local authorities in
                        Armenia.</p>
                    <p>The restraint, complained of to the British consular authorities, seems to
                        comprise the mutilation and in some instances the confiscation of their
                        books by the education department of the local authorities, notwithstanding
                        the fact that the books have already passed the censorship at
                        Constantinople.</p>
                    <p>Her Britannic Majesty’s consul at Erzeroum, Mr. Everett, in his report of the
                        matter to Lord Dufferin, says: “It is probable that in many cases the local
                        authorities have no knowledge of the existence of a Protestant Firman, and
                        that in many others there is entire ignorance of its terms,” and suggests
                        that it might be conducive to the better treatment of the American citizens
                        engaged in the book trade if an order be issued by the Sublime Porte
                        reminding the local authorities in Asia Minor of the rights acquired by the
                        American citizens through the firman, and enjoining them to take care that
                        in the future those engaged in such work be in no way molested.</p>
                    <p>This suggestion would doubtless, if executed, prove efficacious in many
                        cases. You are therefore instructed to use your good offices to promote such
                        a result.</p>
                    <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0674"/>
                    <p>Citizens of the United States engaged in the sale of books in Turkey should,
                        at all times be willing to show the local authorities that the books offered
                        for sale have passed the censorship at Constantinople, and, to avoid
                        collision with such authorities in the interior, the books should be stamped
                        to show that fact.</p>
                    <p>It seems to me that the adoption of such measures may gain the respect and
                        confidence of such authorities.</p>
                    <p>You are authorized to express to Lord Dufferin as well as to Mr. Everett, Her
                        Majesty’s consul at Erzeroum, through him, the thanks of this Department for
                        their kind and courteous intervention on behalf of the Rev. Robert Chambers,
                        an American missionary at Erzeroum.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your dispatch of July 17th last,
                        No. 214, relative to the restrictions on the sale of the publications of the
                        American Bible Society by the Ottoman authorities, I regret that I have
                        nothing satisfactory to report.</p>
                    <p>I have had repeated conversations with the minister of foreign affairs on the
                        subject and he has assurred me that he has asked the minister of public
                        instruction to issue orders to put a stop to the arbitrary acts of the
                        subordinate officials in the provinces who interfere with and practically
                        stop the sale of books hawked about the country by colporteurs. If such
                        orders have been given they have had no effect. The <pb n="575"
                            xml:id="pg_575" facs="0675"/>authorities do not seem to object to the
                        sale of books by stationary Vendors in the large towns, where there are
                        employés who are able, from a knowledge of the law, to control the sales, by
                        determining whether the publications have been duly approved by the
                        censorship; but they do object to books being hawked about the country and
                        in villages where there are no competent officials.</p>
                    <p>Although <hi rend="italic">we</hi> have entire confidence in the integrity
                        and loyalty of the missionaries and are sure that they will not transgress
                        any law or regulation upon the circulation of printed matter, it is
                        difficult to in spire the Turk with the same confidence.</p>
                    <p>The frequent emigration of young men to the United States, who return to this
                        country with naturalization papers, is attributed in a large degree to the
                        influence of the books issued by the American Bible House, and especially to
                        the instruction given at numerous schools established in Armenia under the
                        auspices of the American Board of Foreign Missions.</p>
                    <p>The Turks are probably indifferent to this proselyting which is confined to
                        Armenian Christians, but the Armenian clergy do not take so calm a view of
                        the matter, and it is owing to their influence, which is, in some matters,
                        very strong, that the missionaries encounter so many difficulties in the
                        prosecution of their beneficent and civilizing work.</p>
                    <p>This influence is daily felt not only in the sale of their books, but in the
                        opening of schools, which were formerly licensed without much difficulty,
                        but are now strongly opposed by the Turkish authorities. The refusal to
                        grant permission for the establishment of printing presses is another
                        frequent occasion for complaint.</p>

                        my memorandum to Mr. Seijas on the subject.</p>
                    <p>It will have been seen from my No. 824, of date 20th ultimo, that my
                        intention of following up the matter further at that time was superseded by
                        the receipt of a verbal note from Mr. Seijas which, referring to the
                        “interviews touching the matter of Mr. Wheelock, indicated that instructions
                        relative to Mr. Wheelock’s case were being sent by the then going mail to
                        the chargé d’affaires of Venezeula at Washington; and from my No. 829, of
                        date 29th ultimo, it will be seen that upon the receipt of this verbal note
                        my view was that it was completely within the competence of this Government,
                        if it so chose, to transfer the consideration of the matter to Washington,
                        through the instrumentality of its chargé d’affaires at that capital, and
                        that the verbal note in question was an indication of such choice on the
                        part of this Government. I have not been <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576"

                        chargé d’affaires relative to the case.</p>
                    <p>If, in any possible aspect of the matter, I should be mistaken in the view
                        which I have taken as to the legitimate diplomatic effect of Mr. Seijas’s
                        said verbal note, I request that the Department will advise me thereof.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: A matter affecting Mr. John Dalton, United
                        States consul at Ciudad Bolivar, has recently occurred in this capital. The
                            <hi rend="italic">Opinion National</hi> of the 31st ultimo contained a
                        letter, which is really an order from the President, Guzman Blanco,
                        directing, in substance, that Mr. John Dalton and some twenty or more other
                        persons of Ciudad Bolivar, be subjected to an arrest of three days in the
                        quarters of the national force; that is, in effect, be subjected to three
                        days’ imprisonment in the military quarters at Ciudad Bolivar, for, in
                        short, having made a representation touching a certain matter of the
                        domestic economy of the country, in terms which the President regards as
                        disrespectful. I first saw this letter on the morning of the 1st instant,
                        and at once proceeded to prepare a note to Mr. Seijas on the matter,
                        concluding with a respectful request that said order be not executed so far
                        as it applies to Mr. Dalton, and a respectful and solemn protest against its
                        execution as applied to him. This note I sent to Mr. Seijas in the evening
                        of the 1st instant. On the 8th instant I received from Mr. Seijas, in
                        answer, a somewhat lengthy and completely unsatisfactory note, of date 7th
                        instant, setting at naught my request and my protest. With other work, I
                        have not yet had time to prepare a proper reply, and a full report of the
                        case and correspondence must necessarily await the next mail. I merely write
                        this for your early preliminary information. * * *</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>.: Referring to my No. 892, of date 10th
                        instant, relative to an order for the arrest of Mr. John Dalton, United
                        States consul at Ciudad Bolivar, and others, I now write to say that I find
                        it absolutely impossible to send a full report of the case by the present
                        mail. There are some things which Mr. Seijas refers to in his note on the
                        subject which I wish to look at before writing my answer, and which I have
                        not yet had an opportunity to examine. I wish to make no possible mistake in
                        the matter.</p>
                    <p>I have not yet received any communication on the subject from Mr. Dalton, and
                        have to-day written him a dispatch, informing him of the prompt action which
                        I took with the view of preventing his arrest; that I am left, however, to
                        infer from the order, and from Mr. Seijas’ note that he has actually been
                        arrested; and telling him that, if he has not already done so, he should as
                        soon as practicable make a full report of the matter to the Department of
                        State and to this legation. I will communicate further on the subject as
                        soon as possible.</p>

                            Government has done in the territories during the last three years has
                            had as much foresight as its results have been satisfactory. Although
                            there were no more than that, it would suffice to prove that the
                            administration which closes has known how to conduct the Government with
                            singular prudence.</p>
                        <p>Before the consequences of the crisis we are passing through could he
                            felt in the country, it proceeded to create for it revenues which would
                            supply the deficiency about to supervene in the existing revenues.</p>
                        <p>The territories being organized one after another, with laws,
                            authorities, and administration, it began to yield the working of their
                            natural products; it afterwards increased the yield, and it is increased
                            in a manner so happy that the revenue created from the territories has
                            advanced to cover that which, on account of the depreciation of coffee,
                            the revenue of the Republic is losing, as may be seen by studying my
                            recent message to the present Congress.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: My attention was arrested this morning by
                            a letter from his excellency the President of the Republic to his
                            excellency the minister of public works, of date 29th ultimo, as the
                            same appears in the <hi rend="italic">Opinion Nacional</hi> of the 31st
                            ultimo. Upon inquiry I learn that it has not yet been published in the
                                <hi rend="italic">Gaceta Oficial</hi>. The nature of the contents of
                            the letter, the violent presumption of its authenticity, though
                            published in an unofficial periodical, and my clear conviction that it
                            is my plain duty to draw your excellency’s urgent attention to it at the
                            earliest possible moment, will obviously justify my reference to it in
                            its present form of publication.</p>
                        <p>The letter in question, which is really an order, states in effect that
                            Mr. John Dalton and various other persons of Ciudad Bolivar, protesting
                            against what the Government has done for the working of Caura, have made
                            representation in terms truly improper, as being disrepectful; and
                            directs that for this, without loss of a moment, the minister of public
                            works will communicate to the minister of the interior, who will
                            communicate on the matter to the president of the State of Bolivar, in
                            order that he may impose on said persons an imprisonment of three days
                            in the quarters of the national force.</p>
                        <p>I am fully persuaded that there can be no real law of Venezuela which
                            authorizes the summary seizure and imprisonment, upon an executive
                            order, of a citizen of the United States domiciled in Venezuela, for the
                            mere joining with others in making a representation touching a matter of
                            the domestic economy of the country in terms which the President may
                            regard as disrespectful. I should be surprised to learn that there is
                            such a law in any republic on the globe.</p>
                        <p>Mr. John Dalton, of Ciudad Bolivar, is consul of the United States of
                            America, and I understand he is also a citizen thereof, domiciled in
                            Ciudad Bolivar. Therefore, as in duty bound, as diplomatic agent of the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: On the 2d I received your
                            excellency’s communication of the 1st, in which, grounding yourself on
                            the presumed authenticity of a letter published in the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Opinion Nacional</hi>, you protest against its contents, after
                            requesting that there may not be applied to Mr. John Dalton, consul of
                            the United States at Ciudad Bolivar, the order of the President there
                            communicated for the imprisonment of him and others who have addressed
                            themselves to the first magistrate in disrespectful terms.</p>
                        <p>I will begin by indicating to your excellency that in fact the President
                            of the Republic has expedited such order, although not for imprisonment,
                            as your excellency qualifies it, but for arrest, by way of correction of
                            the fault committed.</p>
                        <p>In Venezuela, by article 555 of the penal code, the violation of the
                            respect due to <pb n="580" xml:id="pg_580" facs="0680"/>authority is
                            ranked as a fault against public order and is punished by arrest for the
                            time of five to twenty days, unless on account of its gravity it may
                            constitute the crime designated “desecration,” in which case the
                            punishment is much greater. For this a proceeding is necessary and the
                            punishment is applied by the tribunals. But, moreover, the authorities,
                            as well legislative as political and judicial, can, without previous
                            trial, impose by way of correction mulcts and arrests which are not
                            considered as punishment, according to article 43 of the code cited.</p>
                        <p>Almost daily are read in the periodicals of this city notices of arrests
                            decreed by the governor or the prefects of the federal district, in
                            virtue of power which has been conceded to them by the President of the
                            Republic, who has constitutional power to organize it and act in it as
                            first authority, civil and political. (Article 65, No. 7 of the
                            Constitution.)</p>
                        <p>By No. 10 of the same, in cases of foreign war, the President can “arrest
                            or expel individuals who may belong to the nation with which this is at
                            war, and who may be adverse to the defense of the country.”</p>
                        <p>According to article 137 of the penal code, the national Executive, the
                            country being declared in civil war, can detain all individuals who for
                            political motives he may believe prejudicial to the peace and security
                            of the Republic.</p>
                        <p>“In time of peace,” says the second part of the article, “the national
                            Executive cannot detain any citizen for <hi rend="italic">political
                                motives</hi>.”</p>
                        <p>Then it is clear that for other motives he can detain them.</p>
                        <p>In fact it would be an absurdity that the President of the Republic,
                            chief of the general administration, sole representative of the respect
                            of foreign powers, colaborer of the legislature, charged with the
                            fulfillment of the laws, supreme chief of the national army, and to whom
                            is committed the security of the country, and the guarding of its
                            interests and its honor, should have his hands tied, and should have to
                            leave unpunished lacks of respect for the Government—estimated according
                            to his own criterion.</p>
                        <p>That of the United States has not proceeded thus when it has believed
                            itself offended in its dignity by foreign diplomatic agents, as took
                            place in 1809 with Mr. Jackson, British minister; in 1818 with General
                            Lino de Clemente, chargé d’affaires of Venezuela; in 1849 with Mr.
                            Poussin, representative of France; and in various other cases in which
                            it has judged its respect offended by publications made, or letters
                            addressed to the supreme magistrate, on matters pending in the
                            department of exterior relations.</p>
                        <p>There is no treaty in force between Venezuela and the United States. So
                            to their citizens article 10 of the constitution is applicable, which
                            gives to foreigners the same civil rights as to Venezuelans, and the
                            same security in their persons and property.</p>
                        <p>Nor does the circumstance of Mr. Dalton being a consul hinder; for the
                            Republic, in accord in this with the United States, does not admit that
                            consuls may have diplomatic privileges or may be exempt from the civil
                            and criminal jurisdiction of the place of their residence, as to what
                            does not concern their functions, chanceries, flag, escutcheons,
                            archives, and seals.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, Mr. Dalton, at the same time that he is a consul, is a
                            merchant in Ciudad Bolivar; and in such character, which gives him no
                            right above the other merchants, but on the contrary places them on a
                            level at every point, it was that he associated himself with the other
                            signers of the protest.</p>
                        <p>But there is more: Mr. Dalton’s character of consul is a circumstance
                            aggravating his fault; for, according to the regulations prescribed for
                            the use of the consular service of the United, States edition of 1881,
                            which I have in view, their consuls, when for lack of a diplomatic agent
                            they may communicate directly with the Government, ought to do it in a
                            courteous, and dignified manner, a precept which is extended to every
                            class of correspondence with the local authorities.</p>
                        <p>It is there likewise seen that they are commanded to avoid public
                            discourses as far as possible, and above all to abstain from unfavorable
                            or critical comments on the institutions or acts of the government to
                            which they may be accredited.</p>
                        <p>It is remembered that in the United States the French consul, Mr. Dillon,
                            was arrested for not having complied with the order of appearance of the
                            tribunal, notwithstanding that a clause of the respective conventions
                            excepted the consul from such obligation.</p>
                        <p>According to the same book which I have before cited, the consuls of the
                            United States in Belgium, Germany and Holland, are free from arrest,
                            unless for crimes. In France they have personal immunities; but if they
                            are Frenchmen or occupy themselves in trade, they can only claim the
                            immunities conceded to other citizens of the country who possess
                            property or are merchants. In Austria-Hungary merchant consuls can only
                            be detained for mercantile debts. In Colombia the consuls of the United
                            States have no diplomatic character. In Great Britain, Liberia, Holland
                            (as to colonies), Nicaragua, and Paraguay they are considered as chosen
                            for the protection of commerce.</p>
                        <pb n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0681"/>
                        <p>In Venezuela, I should add, consuls have no diplomatic character, nor
                            immunity from civil and criminal jurisdiction, as was declared in 1852
                            and in 1872, and lastly in the decree of the 25th of January, 1883.</p>
                        <p>As the Republic has made no consular convention with the United States,
                            nor remains in force the last treaty of commerce of 1860, which included
                            some consular articles, these rules of said instructions, paragraph 77
                            are applicable to the consuls of the United States here: “However, a
                            consul, according to public law, is subject to the payment of
                            contributions and imposts and municipal taxes on his property in the
                            country, or on his trade, and in general, to the civil and criminal
                            jurisdiction of the country where he resides. It is probable that, if he
                            does not engage in business, and possesses no immmovable property, he
                            would not be subject to arrest or incarceration except for a criminal
                            charge, and in case of committing a crime he can be punished by the
                            local laws, or returned to his own country.”</p>
                        <p>Besides being a merchant, the consul, Mr. Dalton, is proprietor of
                            immovable property; so that all the circumstances favorable to his
                            arrest concur in him.</p>
                        <p>In the extinguished treaty of 1860, between Venezuela and the United
                            States, the case is provided for, and solved in the following manner,
                            article 26:</p>
                        <p>“The high contracting parties grant to each other the liberty of having
                            in the ports of the other, consuls and vice-consuls of their own
                            appointment, who shall enjoy the same privileges and powers as those of
                            the most favored nation; but if any of said consuls carry on trade they
                            shall be subject to the same laws and usages to which private
                            individuals of their nation are subject in the same place.”</p>
                        <p>Finally, if the President should hot have sufficent power for what he has
                            done—which is denied—the present first magistrate would derive it from
                            the extraordinary powers conferred on him.</p>
                        <p>The measure taken with Mr. Dalton is merely one of police. Had it been
                            desired to subject him to a punishment he would have been ordered to be
                            proceeded against, after withdrawing his exequatur, or he would have
                            been expelled for the impropriety of his conduct.</p>
                        <p>What has been exposed will convince your excellency of the reason which
                            has supported the first magistrate in imposing a correction on Mr.
                            Dalton, not in jail, but in the quarters of the national forces, for a
                            want of respect, which without doubt is punished in all countries of the
                            globe where authority is conscious of its duties.</p>

                            instant, in reply to my note of date 1st instant, relative to the case
                            of Mr. John Dalton, United States consul at Ciudad Bolivar, has been
                            received, attentively considered, and I regret to be constrained to add
                            found to be completely unsatisfactory.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency’s preliminary corrective observation, indicating that the
                            order of the President was “not for imprisonment,” as I had qualified
                            it, “but for arrest by way of correction of the fault committed,” is
                            found to be without substantial weight. To arrest and detain one in
                            custody in military quarters for three days is, in reason and in the
                            general legal sense, an <hi rend="italic">imprisonment</hi> for that
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Nor do I find any substantial weight in your excellencys palliative
                            observation that “the measure taken with Mr. Dalton is merely one of
                            police.”</p>
                        <p>There is nothing upon which my Government places so high a store as upon
                            the rightful liberties of its citizens. The summary seizure and
                            detention for three days in military custody of a man who is at once a
                            citizen and a consul of the United States, is very serious business,
                            demanding a clear warrant therefor, a warrant which in this case I am
                            wholly unable to discover.</p>
                        <p>Nor do I find any cogent weight in your excellency’s general observation
                            to the purport that it would be absurd to suppose that the President
                            “should have his hands tied, and should have to leave unpunished lacks
                            of respect for the Government, estimated according to his own
                            criterion.” To be sure the President, as every chief magistrate of a
                            nation, must be supposed to have proper power, <hi rend="italic">limited

                                xml:id="pg_582" facs="0682"/>the President in these matters,
                            unlimited except by his own criterion or judgment, is wholly
                            untenable.</p>
                        <p>In short, I must candidly say that it appears to me that none of the
                            observations of your excellency go with any cogent weight to the
                            case.</p>
                        <p>Saving without prejudice all other things that might be said, it appears
                            to me that the following is sufficient and conclusive.</p>
                        <p>As your excellency observes, article 10 of the constitution gives to
                            foreigners the same civil rights as to Venezuelans. I draw your
                            excellency’s attention to the guarantees to Venezuelans contained in
                            article 14, section 6 of the constitution relative to the liberty of
                            expressing thought; in article 14, section 10, relative to the liberty
                            of petition; and in article 14, section 14, clause 4, relative to
                            individual security. The provision of this last is:</p>
                        <p>“The nation guarantees to Venezuelans * * * neither to be taken nor
                            arrested without the proceeding of a summary information of an offense
                                (<hi rend="italic">delito</hi>) having been committed which merits
                            corporal punishment, and a written order of the functionary who decrees
                            the seizure with an expression of the motive which causes it, unless
                            taken in the act.”</p>
                        <p>This is the fundamental law of Venezuela, in conflict with which any
                            other law or usage of the country is wanting in real legality, in
                            presence of it, I regard the arrest and detention of Mr. Dalton as
                            plainly illegal. If, as your excellency’s note leaves me to conclude,
                            the order in question has in fact been executed at against him.</p>
                        <p>I avail, &amp;c.,</p>

                            made aware of a recent letter or order of the President, Guzman Blanco,
                            directing, in substance, that you and some twenty or more other persons,
                            of Ciudad Bolivar, be subjected to an arrest of three days in the
                            quarters of the national force—that is, in effect, be subjected to three
                            days imprisonment in the military quarters at Ciudad Bolivar—for, in
                            short, having made a representation touching a certain matter of the
                            domestic economy of the country, in terms which the President regards as
                            “disrespectful.” This letter or order was published in the <hi
                                rend="italic">Opinion Nacional</hi> of the 31st ultimo. I first saw
                            it on the morning of the 1st instant, and in the evening of the same day
                            I sent to the minister of exterior relations, Mr. Seijas, a note on the
                            matter, concluding with a respectful request that said order be not
                            executed so far as it applies to you, and a respectful and solemn
                            protest against its execution as applied to you. On the 8th instant I
                            received from Mr. Seijas, in answer, a somewhat lengthy and completely
                            unsatisfactory note, of date 7th instant setting at naught my request
                            and my protest.</p>
                        <p>This much for the purpose of informing you, as is eminently proper in
                            such a case, of the prompt action which I took with the view of
                            preventing your arrest. I am left, however, to infer from the order, and
                            from Mr. Seijas’ note that you have in fact been arrested.</p>
                        <p>I have not yet received any communication from you on the subject, and it
                            may yet be too early for that. I draw your attention to paragraph 83 of
                            consular regulations, 1881. If you have not already done so, you should
                            as soon as practicable make a full report of the matter to the
                            Department of State and to this legation.</p>

                            inexpedient and impracticable to accept the contention of the Venezuelan

                            has been pending in your excellency’s ministry; to the numerous times
                            that in pursuance of instructions from my Government it has been urged
                            upon the attention of your excellency’s Government; and to respectfully

                            the law of this case, it appears to me that the case has now reached a

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your No. 893 of the 11th ultimo has been
                        received. You therein speak of your purpose to prepare a comprehensive
                        despatch on the general subject of claims differences between the United
                        States and Venezuela, and as an important point in this connection you
                        recommend that the decree of February 14, 1873, be exhaustively examined
                        with a view to determining whether or not, taken as a whole, its provisions
                        constitute a domestic law which should be recognized and respected as such
                        by foreign governments.</p>
                    <p>My No. 286 of the 8th ultimo, sending you transcripts of the correspondence
                        lately exchanged between Mr. Soteldo and myself in regard to the Wheelock
                        case, will have shown you that the bearing of the decree of February 14,
                        1873, on the question had already been considered.</p>
                    <p>As will be seen, Mr. Soteldo asserts that our Court of Claims is the
                        prototype of the high federal court. In this he is mistaken, as I show. It
                        is true that besides the special jurisdiction of the Court of Claims in
                        matters of contract and statutory obligations, it may also take cognizance
                        of such claims as may be referred to it by Congress. A foreign claim for
                        tort might be so referred, but only with the assent of the foreigner’s
                        Government. A case in point occurred quite recently, where this Government
                        proposed to that of Great Britain that a claim of a British subject should,
                        by authority of Congress, be referred to the Court of Claims for
                        adjudication. The British Government declined the proposition on the ground
                        that the exclusively domestic organization of the court made it
                        inappropriate as a substitute for an international tribunal.</p>
                    <p>It is probable that this instruction, joined to the correspondence sent with
                        my No. 286, will sufficiently answer your No. 893. Your full examination of
                        the subject is, however, awaited and will receive due consideration. You
                        will probably find it advisable to consider how, the unqualified acceptance
                        of the jurisdiction of the high federal court over all alien cases would
                        affect proceedings looking to redress in case the threatened invasion of Mr.
                        Dalton’s consular and personal rights (reported in your Nos. 892 and 902)
                        should be unhappily affected.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received your No. 902, of the 18th
                        ultimo, in the matter of the arrest of Mr. John Dalton, United States consul
                        at Ciudad Bolivar, by order of the President of Venezuela, and have to
                        approve your request of Mr. Dalton to be immediately furnished with full
                        particulars in the premises.</p>
                    <p>My instruction No. 294, of the 7th instant, will have shown you the action
                        thus far taken with Mr. Soteldo, the Venezuelan minister here, in regard to
                        the case. You will have observed from that instruction the Department’s
                        intention to await details before formulating a specific complaint.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dalton belongs to a class of consuls authorized to transact business. If
                        he does, he is for all purposes of such business subject to the same
                        treatment as any other American resident engaged in trade in Venezuela. He
                        is manifestly subject to no less favorable treatment, although he may have
                        no specific personal exemptions or privileges by reason of his office. But
                        if he, a consul, has been subjected to treatment to which no American
                        citizen under the treaty can be, that is, to imprisonment in virtue of an
                        executive order without trial or opportunity for legal defense, then the
                        fact of his being known as the representative of a friendly power might be
                        deemed to aggravate the injury committed.</p>
                    <p>You should lose no time in sending hither copies of all documents, the
                        petition, the order of arrest, the correspondence between yourself, the
                        Venezuelan Government, and Mr. Dalton, and any other information bearing
                        upon the case, in order that the Department may give to it a full and
                        impartial consideration.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received your No. 907, of the 27th
                        ultimo, concerning the supposed subjection of Mr. John Dalton, United States
                        consul at Cindad Bolivar to arrest and detention in the military barracks
                        there in virtue of an executive order of President Guzman Blanco.</p>
                    <p>My No. 297, of the 12th instant, will have already shown you the interest
                        which is here taken in this question.</p>
                    <p>I have now to approve your note of protest addressed to Mr. Seijas on the 1st
                        ultimo, and also your reply of April 26 to Mr. Seijas’s note of the 7th.</p>
                    <p>You appear to correctly understand the situation, and have in great measure
                        met the strangely sophistical and fallacious argument of Mr. Seijas. <pb
                            n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0686"/>The gist of the matter is not that
                        a consular officer may have been adjudged liable to arrest for alleged
                        contempt of the authority of the country, but that an American citizen
                        should be punished for such charged contempt by a mere executive order,
                        without intervention of any competent judicial authority, and without
                        process of any kind, or hearing, or opportunity of defense. In other words,
                        our ground may be briefly summarized as holding that in time of peace the
                        executive or military arm may not usurp the functions of the judiciary as
                        toward an alien, without violating the laws of nations, the rights of
                        hospitality, and the comity of treatment usual among friendly States.</p>
                    <p>These considerations are merely general, and their application to the case in
                        hand necessarily depends on whether Mr. Dalton, or any other citizen of the
                        United States, has in fact been subjected to deprivation of liberty by
                        military force without civil process. It is still hoped that this may not
                        have been the case. If, however, it has been done, a reply to Mr. Seijas’s
                        note of April 7 will be in order, and you will be instructed
                        accordingly.</p>

                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>A copy of a dispatch from Mr. Dalton to myself, of date 13th

                        </list></p>
                    <p>In view of the nature of the subject, I invite the careful attention of the
                        Department to all these inclosures.</p>
                    <p>It will be seen that Mr. Dalton reports that he was not personally arrested,
                        being confined by sickness at the time, but that, in his place his son, John
                        Dalton, jr., was taken as a substitute, and kept in prison three days. I
                        have taken the view that this was, in effect, equivalent to the imprisonment
                        of Mr. Dalton himself. I feel so confident that this view is correct, and
                        that to suppose else is“to stick in the bark” of the true meaning and
                        substance of the matter, that I have to respectfully request that if the
                        Department should by possibility think otherwise it will suspend final
                        judgment on the point until I can have an opportunity to say something
                        further in relation thereto.* * *</p>

                        <p>We, the undersigned, merchants resident in this city, do hereby most
                            respectfully set forth: By the contract entered into by that department
                            with Messrs. Polly, Aurrecoechea &amp;, Co., on the 28th of February,
                            1883, it is granted to said gentlemen for the <pb n="589"
                                xml:id="pg_589" facs="0689"/>term of twenty-five years, to be
                            prolonged twenty-five years more, at the discretion of the federal
                            executive, the exclusive right of gathering all the vegetable products
                            discovered or to be discovered in the federal territory “El Caura,” such
                            as tonca-beans, rubber, quinine, piassava, palms, agaves (aloes),
                            copaiba, mazaranda, reeds, vanilla, almonds (Para chestnuts), rosins,
                            barks, &amp;c. The greater part of the above-mentioned products are well
                            known articles, and have been of free barter in this commerce for many
                            years past, and as there is no reason that justifies the privilege
                            granted to said gentlemen, we find it highly prejudicial inasmuch as it
                            restrains the liberty of industry guaranteed by the constitution and
                            laws of the Republic.</p>
                        <p>We beg leave to make a brief analysis of the above-mentioned contract in
                            order to demonstrate its inconvenience; although it offers great
                            advantages to Messrs. Polly, Aurrecoechea &amp; Co., in detriment to
                            traders in said article, the nation derives no benefit from it. This
                            refers to article 1; as regards the others we shall have to make the
                            following brief remarks: <list>
                                <item>By article 2 the Government exempts from the payment of import
                                    duties the indispensable machinery and apparatus for the
                                    establishment and development of the cultivation of the
                                    vegetable products which form the principal subject of that
                                    contract, but Messrs. Polly, Aurrecoechea &amp; Co. have not
                                    imported any kind of machinery nor apparatus for the better
                                    development of the concessions, which undoubtedly was the object
                                    of the Government in granting said privilege.</item>
                                <item>By article 3 it is further granted to the contractors the
                                    right of extracting the grease and all that may be profitable
                                    from the alligators and turtles of the rivers, streams, lagoons,
                                    and marshes situated within the boundaries of the actual State
                                    of Bolivar; this concession, which deprives the State of Bolivar
                                    of its right of taxing such products, restrains at the same time
                                    the liberty of industry, preventing other Venezuelans from
                                    dealing in said article, which constitutes a small business for
                                    retailers.</item>
                                <item>By article 4 it is likewise granted to the contractors the use
                                    of the navigable rivers within the territory “Caura” for the
                                    purpose of establishing there small steamboats for carrying the
                                    products gathered by the company. Messrs. Polly, Aurrecoechea
                                    &amp; Co., however, have done nothing to that effect, inasmuch
                                    as they have not established small steamboats or vessels of any
                                    other description for the said navigation.</item>
                                <item>By article 5 Messrs. Polly, Aurrecoechea sfe Co. bind
                                    themselves to pay the Government, as sole national impost,
                                    50,000 bolivares for 46,000 kilograms of tonca-beans, while the
                                    exporters of this produce have so far paid, and are willing to
                                    pay, 175,000 bolivares for 46,000 kilograms; this causes a loss
                                    to the national treasury of 125,000 bolivares on each 46,000
                                    kilograms exported.</item>
                                <item>By articles 6 and 8 Messrs. Polly, Aurrecoechea &amp; Co. bind
                                    themselves to organize and preserve with same carefulness as
                                    their own property, the rubber, tonca-bean, and other useful
                                    plantations, as well as to explore the virgin forests existing
                                    in the territory “Caura,” and to cooperate toward the subduing
                                    and civilizing of the natives existing in said territory. These
                                    gentlemen, however, have done nothing whatever toward complying
                                    with the regulations of said articles, for which reason the
                                    object the Government had in view in dictating same will not be
                                    attained, to wit, The discovery of all natural riches of said
                                    territory, and the settlement of natives inhabiting same. The
                                    contractors have confined themselves to coming to this city to
                                    appoint agents, with power to grant permits to gather
                                    tonca-beans, <hi rend="italic">but with the express condition
                                        that they must be sold to them at the fixed rate of two and
                                        a half bolivares per pound.</hi></item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>By this uncommon pretension of Messrs. Polly, Aurrecoechea &amp; Co. it
                            is easily perceived the monopoly which they intend to establish, with
                            evident prejudice to those who expose their lives in gathering said
                            product, protected by a contract, without complying, on their part, with
                            any of the obligations stipulated in same, and if they have not
                            fulfilled the condition of their contract, which has been demonstrated,
                            how can they consider themselves authorized to fix a price which is but
                            half the value of the article, and to have the exclusive right of
                            purchasing same at so low a price? The commerce of this city have
                            advanced funds to the retail dealers of the district Cedeño and the
                            territory Caura, contracting tonca-beans at 5 bolivares per pound. Would
                            it be right, then, to let the contractors prevent traders in said
                            product from selling their stock at the price of 5 bolivares per pound,
                            because the merchants of Ciudad Bolivar have been deprived of their
                            right of purchasing same, thus compelling stockholders to sell their
                            products to them (the contractors) at 2½ bolivares per pound based on
                            their privilege?</p>
                        <p>This, besides being restraint of liberty, is highly detrimental to the
                            interests of traders of Cedeño, Caura, and to others, who, aspiring to
                            some gain, come from other sections of the Republic to gather the
                            tonca-beans. Hence the Government, which is in duty bound to protect
                            industry and to watch over the rights and security of its citizens,
                            cannot permit that, making use of its name and protected by a privilege
                            which only favors the contractors, the legitimate interests of commerce
                            are prejudiced, without the nation deriving any benefit whatever
                            therefrom.</p>
                        <pb n="590" xml:id="pg_590" facs="0690"/>
                        <p>Tonca-beans, rubber, copaiba, piassava, and turtle grease are products
                            which have long been exported through this market, forming one of the
                            most important branches of commerce, as much in this market as in the
                            other districts of the State and the territories El Caura and Amazonas.
                            The Government in granting the exclusive privilege to Messrs. Polly,
                            Aurrecoechea &amp; Co. for speculating upon said products, deprives this
                            commerce of one part of its transactions and causes great losses to
                            other speculators from the moment the contractors only offer to pay
                            one-half of its value, thus establishing an odious monopoly, which the
                            Government is in duty hound to prevent in accordance with the guarantees
                            of the liberty of industry and the rights of Venezuelans.</p>
                        <p>As above stated, Messrs. Polly, Aurrecoechea &amp; Co. have not imported
                            any machinery or apparatus for the development of the products mentioned
                            in their contract; they have established neither steamboats nor vessels
                            of any other description for the navigation of the Caura River; they
                            have taken no steps whatever for the subduing and civilization of the
                            natives, nor for the organization and preservation of the tonca-bean,
                            rubber, and other useful plantations, neither with carefulness, nor in
                            any other way; moreover, they have not even taken the trouble to visit
                            the territory which they intend to speculate upon with the Government’s
                            consent and with the work of unfortunates who, stimulated by poverty,
                            penetrate in the forests to return after many perils and sufferings,
                            with a few products to support their families; and would it be just, we
                            repeat, that being able to place these products at 5 bolivares per
                            pound, they should be compelled to sell them in this city at 2½
                            bolivares per pound to the agents of Messrs. Polly, Aurrecoechea &amp;
                            Co.? We cannot believe it; we have rather the firm conviction based on
                            the known rectitude of the Government, that upon being informed of the
                            abuses which the contractors seek to put in practice, protected by a
                            contract undoubtedly granted with laudable motives, the Government will
                            hasten to declare same void on account of non-fulfillment of any of its
                            stipulations, as they only have in view the advantages they have to
                            profit, to the detriment of the legitimate interests of the commerce of
                            this city and of other places in the Republic of Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>In view therefore of the above-stated facts we now beg to apply to you,
                            entreating you to submit this petition to the President of the Republic,
                            in order that, taking same into consideration, he may declare the
                            above-mentioned contract rescinded as an act of strict justice which we
                            do not doubt to obtain.</p>
                        <p>At Ciudad Bolivar, March 13, 1884.</p>

                        <p>The foresight of the Government in regard to the territories has been
                            justified by the satisfactory result obtained during the last three
                            years. This fact alone would suffice to prove that the administration
                            that is about to terminate has been conducted with singular ability.</p>
                        <p>Before the consequences of the crisis we are now going through were felt
                            in the country, I endeavored to create sufficient revenues to supply the
                            decay of those that, existed. The territories being organized one after
                            the other with laws, authorities, and administration, the cultivation of
                            their natural products commenced to yield and soon after increased and
                            is increasing in such a prosperous manner that the revenues of the
                            territories have been sufficient to cover the deficiency caused by the
                            depreciation of the coffee, as may be seen by perusing my recent message
                            to Congress, now in session. But in opposition to and protesting against

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my note to his excellency Mr.
                            Rafael Seijas, of date 1st ultimo, relative to the case of Mr. John
                            Dalton, United States consul at Ciudad Bolivar, also to Mr. Seijas note
                            to me, of date 7th ultimo, in reply to mine, also to my note to Mr.
                            Seijas, of date 26th ultimo, in rejoinder to his, I have now to add that
                            I received last night a report from Mr. Dalton relative to the matter,
                            in the light of which I deem it my duty to recur at the earliest
                            possible moment to the subject.</p>
                        <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0692"/>
                        <p>I am now informed by Mr. Dalton to the purport that he was not personally
                            arrested, being confined by sickness at the time, but that in his place
                            his son, John Dalton, jr., was taken as a substitute and kept in prison
                            three days.</p>
                        <p>Thus the father, the citizen and consul of the United States of America,
                            was most effectively punished in his own person and humiliated in his
                            own feelings by the substituted imprisonment inflicted upon his son.</p>
                        <p>It appears to me it will be vain to pretend that there is any exculpating
                            difference between the extraordinary case as thus stated and the case as
                            it would have been had Mr. Dalton been personally imprisoned, and I must
                            logically presume, from the vicarious theory which appears to have been
                            resorted to and acted upon in the matter, that no such difference will
                            be claimed; and this is, to say nothing as to the rights which may
                            attach to John Dalton, jr., himself, an aspect of the case which is for
                            the present reserved.</p>
                        <p>As I am made more familiar with the details of the case, it becomes more
                            intensely displeasing. I had supposed there might be something
                            personally disrespectful in the terms of the representation or petition
                            which was the occasion of the order for arrest, and which, although it
                            would by no means justify a summary seizure and imprisonment, would have
                            to be looked at as an extenuating circumstance. But upon an examination
                            of a copy of this document, as sent me by Mr. Dalton, I am unable to
                            discover so much as the slightest ground for any such extenuation.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, limiting myself strictly to the bearings of the matter on the
                            rights of persons under the protection of the United States of America,
                            I now regard the proceeding in question as having been wholly without
                            rightful warrant or palliating extenuation—a view which I feel confident
                            my Government will fully, promptly, and heartily take of the
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>Deeply regretting the occurrence of an incident so painful, so uncalled
                            for, and so gravely and justly offensive to my Government,</p>
                        <p>I avail, &amp;c.,</p>

                            response to mine of the 18th ultimo, was received on the night of the
                            26th instant, and commanded my immediate attention. The proceeding in
                            reference to which you write, I regard as an outrage without mitigation.
                            The imprisonment of your son, as stated by you, I regard as
                            tantamount—in its international legal effect—to your own
                            imprisonment.</p>

                        <p>It is of much importance, as you will readily see, that the very truth in
                            regard to what you describe—in as much extent and detail as possible,
                            and supported by evidence of the particular facts—should be promptly
                            brought to the knowledge of our Government.</p>
                        <p>Therefore I advise that you proceed at once to take the fullest and most
                            detailed evidence practicable in the matter, being conscientiously and
                            scrupulously careful to elicit the truth, and only the truth. A
                            certified copy of this evidence should be sent to the Department of
                            State, and another to this legation.</p>
                        <p>Also, in reference to one aspect of the case, please inform me of the
                            place and time of birth of your son John, and of any other facts within
                            your knowledge that may have a bearing on the question of his
                            citizenship.</p>

                        your dispatch numbered 286, of date 8th of April last, taken in connection
                        with your note to Mr. Soteldo, of date 4th of April last, a copy of which
                        was sent as an inclosure with your said dispatch, and also in connection

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my note to your excellency,
                            of date 6th instant, relative to the case of Mr. John E. Wheelock (to
                            which note I have not as yet had the honor of receiving response), I
                            have now to say that, in view of the exceptional monstrosity of the
                            outrage committed upon Mr. Wheelock by the Venezuelan official Sotillo
                            and his accomplices, the length of time the case has been pending and
                            postponed by your excellency’s Government, and the stringent character
                            of the instructions under which I am acting, I deem it appropriate, in
                            an entirely friendly and respectful manner, to again earnestly and
                            urgently draw your excellency’s attention to that case, and to the
                            absolute necessity of disposing of it.</p>
                        <p>In the light of recent instructions and information from my Government, I
                            deem it proper to distinctly add that the general position of your
                            excellency’s Government in regard to remanding to the high federal court
                            claims presented by the Government of the United States against the
                            Government of Venezuela can in no wise be admitted. Claims thus
                            presented by my Government against yours, in behalf of persons or
                            interests under its protection, are international in their character,
                            and hence have an inherent right to international treatment, that is, to
                            diplomatic treatment, as distinguished from domestic treatment.</p>
                        <p>Any convenience which might otherwise suggest resort, in any such case,
                            with the assent of my Government to the adjudication of the high federal
                            court, meets, to say the least, with an insuperable obstruction in the
                            provisions of the law or decree which has been made and provided for in
                            such cases in Venezuela.</p>

                        John Dalton, United States consul at Ciudad Bolivar, have been received.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dalton did send to the Department the papers to which you refer, and they
                        have been fully and carefully examined. Pending the determination of the
                        citizenship of young Mr. Dalton, as requested by you, no definite action has
                        been taken in the premises. The visit of ex-President Guzman Blanco to
                        Washington recently, gave me an opportunity to express the sentiments of
                        this Government respecting the assumed right of that of Venezuela to subject
                        American citizens to arrest without form of trial or opportunity for

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The question of the arrest of Mr. Dalton, at
                        Ciudad Bolivar, came up during my recent conversation with General Guzman
                        Blanco. He sought to justify the proceeding by detailed argument, which in
                        the main followed the line laid down by Señor Seijas in his note to you on
                        the subject, and was equally unsatisfactory as to the legality of the
                        arrest, without trial or opportunity of defense, and without judicial
                        process, of an alien who may be entitled to the protection of his Government
                        under international law and the comity of nations.</p>
                    <p>I contented myself, however, with reserving all discussion of the points
                        advanced by the general, until the facts connected with the arrest of the
                        younger Dalton should be known. From your No. 960, of the 23d ultimo, it
                        appears that you had not yet, up to that date, been able to obtain the
                        information sought.</p>

                        whether young Dalton submitted voluntarily to the order of the President of

                            dispatch dated August 29, last, and must beg your pardon for my seeming
                            inattention in not answering your dispatch of 29th May, but the fact of
                            the matter was that said dispatch arrived on or about the time of the
                            death of my late superior, Mr. Dalton, and was, unfortunately, mislaid.
                            As regards the imprisonment of Mr. John Dalton, jr., in the place of his
                            father, would say when Mr. Dalton, sr., was notified of his arrest
                            (along with the other principal merchants of this place) he was confined
                            in his bed in a very low state of health, so much so that his doctor
                            said his life would be endangered should he be put in prison. For this
                            reason the president of this state of Bolivar, Mr. José Ma. Bermudez
                            Grau, accepted as a substitute his son John Dalton, jr., who remained
                            under arrest three days.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the citizenship of John Dalton, jr., I am quite sure it would
                            not be recognized here, as according to the laws of this country (as per
                            message to the congress of the ex-President Guzman Blanco) any person
                            born in Venezuela is a Venezuelan and always remains one. John Dalton,
                            jr., was born in this town the 17th of April, 1859. He has been educated
                            in the United States, going there when he was about eight years of age.
                            He returned from there after having completed twenty-one years. If he
                            resided in the United States he would be recognized as an American, but
                            as long as he stays here this Government will not qualify him, but as a
                            Venezuelan, although his father was an American citizen.</p>

                        “taken <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0697"/>(or accepted),” when
                        speaking of the imprisonment of the son instead of the father, the precise
                        alternative is formulated. It is regarded as material to know whether Dalton
                        senior being the real object, young Dalton was “taken” as a personal and
                        vicarious substitute, irrespective of his being a member of the firm, or
                        whether he was “accepted” as a sufficient representative of the firm, and
                        equally competent, with his father, to extinguish the penalty arbitrarily
                        imposed on “John Dalton &amp; Co.” In other words, would the son or any
                        other substitute have been taken if not a member of the firm.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Most Excellent Sir</hi>: In accordance with my
                            promise to your excellency, I wrote to my Government urging the
                            importance of a speedy settlement of the citizen Wheelock’s claim.</p>
                        <p>Not content with recommending this officially, I addressed a private
                            letter to his excellency the President of the Republic, very specially
                            urging an immediate settlement of the case, with a view to the removal
                            of every obstacle that might, even indirectly, give rise to any
                            difference between two nations which should constantly draw closer the
                            bonds of friendship and good will that already happily exist between
                            them.</p>
                        <p>At the time of writing those communications I was not familiar with all
                            the phases of the case, nor did I know how it conflicts with the vital
                            institutions of the country which I represent.</p>
                        <p>The facility with which the people of Venezuela and of other
                            Spanish-American republics are burdened with enormous debts for the
                            payment of claims of friendly powers growing out of injuries suffered by
                            their citizens or subjects, has given rise to abuses which threaten to
                            absorb the revenues of them all, and to precipitate them into ruinous
                            conflicts. The history of the past appears incredible as regards these
                            claims, to secure the payment of which the facts have been distorted and
                            exaggerated in every conceivable way, so that trivial acts have been
                            made to appear as most scandalous outrages.</p>
                        <p>If is wholly impossible for any people to pay fabulous sums for every
                            injury suffered by the citizens of other countries, who, in such cases,
                            have enjoyed privileges that have never been accorded to the natives of
                            any country, among which has been that of having direct recourse to
                            diplomatic intervention on the part of their respective Governments, in
                            disregard of the methods of redress established by law, that is to <pb
                                n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0698"/>say, of the courts and other
                            constituted authorities, which alone are now competent in Venezuela to
                            take cognizance of and decide cases like that of Wheelock, the Executive
                            having no power whatever to interfere with their proceedings.</p>
                        <p>I make these remarks in order that your excellency may see the special
                            reasons which have compelled the legislative branch of the Venezuelan
                            Government to put a stop to these abuses, and to relieve the people of
                            the constant pressure which was exhausting their resources and vital
                            elements. Laws have been enacted, similar to those of other countries,
                            for the purpose of dispelling the hope of making a fortune at the
                            expense of the public treasury, which was so frequently entertained by
                            those who had some real or imaginary grievance, and who sought to
                            realize their expectations without having recourse to the courts of the
                            country, which are absolutely the same for both natives and foreigners
                            seeking the redress of their wrongs.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency will be convinced, in the matter in question, of the very
                            great interest which has been taken by Venezuela in Wheelock’s case, it
                            having spared no pains to redress his grievance.</p>
                        <p>The President’s letter, a copy of which I have the honor to inclose, will
                            convince your excellency that no charge can be made against my
                            Government on account of occurrences over which it had absolutely no
                            control, of which it bad no knowledge, and to secure reparation for
                            which the proper course for the complainant would have been to have
                            recourse to the methods prescribed by the laws of the conntry which were
                            in force at the time when his complaint was made.</p>
                        <p>With the most distinguished consideration, &amp;c.,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Esteemed Friend</hi>: By your letter of December
                                15, and by the report of the minister of foreign relations, I have
                                been informed of the recommendation made to you by Mr. Frelinghuysen
                                in regard to the case of Mr. Wheelock. I have also been informed of
                                the steps taken in this case by Mr. Baker.</p>
                            <p>Entertaining as I do the most ardent desire to act in consonance with
                                the wishes of the United States, I have sought to devise some means
                                of doing so without infringing the laws of February 14, 1873, and
                                without establishing a precedent that might at one blow render my
                                arduous toil and important work in the matter of claims of no avail.
                                Neither I nor other persons have been able to succeed in devising
                                such means. The Government has taken a deep interest in
                                investigating the facts of and in inflicting proper punishment for
                                the offense which gave rise to Mr. Wheelock’s complaint. It even
                                sent a lawyer, at its own expense, to Guayana, that he might
                                expedite the preliminary proceedings in the case. To its efforts
                                have been due the issuance of a warrant for the arrest of
                                ex-Commissioner Eusebio Sotillo and for the seizure of his property,
                                with the view of making him criminally and civilly responsible.
                                Unfortunately, he effected his escape, and it has thus far been
                                found impossible to arrest and bring him to trial. The Executive has
                                done and is still doing all in his power to secure his arrest,
                                trial, and punishment.</p>
                            <p>As to the indemnity, it has been maintained that the Republic owes
                                him none, but he may bring his case before the high federal court
                                and demand such reparation from the party who injured him as he may
                                consider himself entitled to. The law has made the nation resposible
                                for seizures of property, damages, and injuries done by federal
                                officers of the States, but it has not empowered the Executive to
                                make awards in such cases.</p>
                            <p>The laws of February 14, 1873, in relation to foreigners and claims,
                                have been vindicated at considerable length by the dispatch of the
                                department of foreign relations, which contained many opinions,
                                decisions, and arguments of United States authorities.</p>
                            <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0699"/>
                            <p>To take a retrograde step in this matter would he not only to act in
                                violation of positive laws, but to make the action of the Government
                                inconsistent with itself.</p>
                            <p>The ultimatum of the French Republic of March 31, 1881, was rejected
                                for the reason that it demanded, in addition to the re-establishment
                                of the provisional quota of 1873, payment of those claims which,
                                like that of Mr. Wheelock, should have been laid before the
                                aforesaid court.</p>
                            <p>I trust that, having examined the case in question, you will duly
                                appreciate the force of these observations, and that you will
                                communicate them to the honorable Secretary of State as an
                                explanation of the insurmountable obstacle which, in spite of my
                                best wishes, prevents me from acceding to the arrangement
                                proposed.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I had the honor to receive from you in due
                            course a note dated the 8th of February, in relation to the Wheelock
                            case, which has now for four years been the occasion of remonstrance and
                            reclamation by this Government against that of Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>My thanks are personally due to you for the prompt and friendly manner in
                            which you endeavored to bring this matter to a settlement by
                            supplementing the representations of this Government and urging an
                            immediate disposition of the claim. I must equally express my regret at
                            your want of success, for, as now appears from your note and from the
                            letter addressed to you by President Guzman Blanco, the Venezuelan
                            Government does not recognize the right of this Government to seek
                            diplomatic redress for one of its citizens injured under circumstances
                            of peculiar hardship.</p>
                        <p>The argument is, as I understand it, briefly, that Venezuela, having in
                            past times been involved in much expense by reason of compensating
                            foreigners injured in person or property by unlawful acts of the
                            Venezuelan authorities, has devised a domestic scheme of laws, whereby
                            foreigners suffering any such wrong are deprived of the right of
                            recourse to the diplomatic interposition of their Governments and
                            constrained to abide by such action “as the local tribunals may take
                            upon their complaints, and that in making efforts to secure the arrest,
                            trial, and punishment of the officer who tortured Mr. Wheelock, the
                            Venezuelan Government has exhausted all possible resources which it
                            might be disposed to employ as an act of friendly deference to another
                            power.</p>
                        <p>I must frankly express disappointment at this unexpected reply. It is
                            impossible in the first place for this Government to accept the
                            proposition that Venezuela is not liable now, because, in view of the
                            expense of recompensing those foreigners who suffer from the inadequate
                            protection the domestic administration of the country affords, that
                            Government has enacted domestic laws disclaiming such liability.</p>
                        <p>There is no principle of international jurisprudence more firmly rooted
                            than that independent states have the sovereign right of intervention to
                            protect their citizens in a foreign state and redress the wrongs they
                            may there suffer, and that this right becomes doubly assured in the
                            presence of a denial of justice.</p>
                        <p>This Government has abundantly recognized this principle in its
                            intercourse with other states. Their claims are admitted to ample
                            discussion, and in case of final disagreement as to the merits of the
                            complaints, <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0700"/>international modes
                            of settlement are resorted to. At the present time, a court of
                            arbitration just held in Washington has decided the unsettled claims of
                            France, on behalf of French citizens injured by the acts of our
                            officers. Consideration of the rights involved outweighs in such cases
                            all considerations of mere expense. In no case do we resort to
                            legislative expedients to restrict the right of foreigners in this
                            country to seek the aid of their own Governments for the redress of
                            alleged wrongs.</p>
                        <p>The issue has been raised in various ways by several of the republics of
                            the American continent, and this Government has consistently contended
                            against such restriction. We hold that the status of a foreigner is,
                            under international law, inherent, and can be neither affected nor
                            destroyed by the municipal law of the state where such foreigners may
                            happen to be sojourning. A foreigner’s right to ask and receive the
                            protection of his Government does not depend upon the local law, but
                            upon the law of his own country. His citizenship goes with him into
                            whatever country he may visit, and the duty of his Government to protect
                            him so long as he does nothing to forfeit his citizenship accompanies
                            him everywhere. This duty his Government must discharge, and it could
                            not, if it would, be relieved therefrom by the fact that the municipal
                            law of the country where its citizen may happen to be has seen fit to
                            provide under what circumstances he may be permitted to appear before
                            the authorities of that country. Such a law cannot control the action or
                            duty of his Government, for governments are bound among themselves only
                            by treaties or by the recognized law of nations, and there is nothing in
                            the existing treaties between the two countries or in the law of nations
                            which recognizes as pertaining to Venezuela the right by the enactment
                            of a municipal law to say how, or where, or under what circumstances the
                            Government of the United States may or may not ask justice in behalf of
                            one of its own citizens.</p>
                        <p>It may, perhaps, be broadly admitted that when the courts of a country
                            afford adequate remedy to foreigners and natives alike in case of
                            wrongful treatment, resort thereto in the first instance by the
                            aggrieved party may be proper; but even in such a case the right of the
                            sufferer’s Government to watch over the proceedings from the outset is
                            inalienable. It is its duty to see at every stage that justice is done,
                            to urge full and speedy compliance with the laws, and” by its counsel
                            and remonstrance, its moral and material support, to advance the
                            interest of its wronged citizen.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wheelock’s case has, however, passed far beyond the initial stage to
                            which President Guzman’s letter would now seek to recommit it. It has
                            reached the higher plane of an apparent denial of justice.</p>
                        <p>The correspondence lately published shows that the departmental and State
                            courts of Venezuela successively decided that no grounds existed for
                            continuing the process or ordering the arrest of the commissary,
                            Sotillo, who inflicted the illegal torture upon Mr. Wheelock. On his
                            excellency’s own showing, this would have sufficed to dismiss the
                            complaint forever, without recourse or appeal.</p>
                        <p>Conceding the right of this Government to ask justice for its injured
                            citizen, the Federal Government of Venezuela ordered the State
                            government to reopen the examination. This was done and the result was
                            the same. Here, then, we have three failures of justice, any one of
                            which, if President Guzman’s argument be admitted as well founded, was
                            necessarily final.</p>
                        <p>But two years afterward the Venezuelan Government discovered that “the
                            result of the proceedings involves civil responsibilites,” and a fourth
                            investigation was held, the result of which amply bore ont the <pb
                                n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0701"/>allegations of Mr. Wheelock’s
                            complaint. Warrants were issued for the arrest of Sotillo, who had
                            meanwhile left the country, and orders were issued to confiscate
                            Sotillo’s property, which he had before this placed out of reach of
                            judicial embargo.</p>
                        <p>Now, after more than four years have passed, it is claimed that the
                            responsibility of Venezuela to punish the offender is met by these tardy
                            and ineffectual proceedings; and, further, that the sufferer is wholly
                            without civil recourse for material reparation, save such as the federal
                            court may find due to him from the commissary, Sotillo.</p>
                        <p>I may be permitted to pass over, as not meriting serious consideration or
                            argument, the allegation which your note implies, that the Government of
                            Venezuela is not liable “on account of occurrences over which it had
                            absolutely no control and of which it had no knowledge.” It is not
                            claimed that the Federal Government directed, or was cognizant of, or
                            consented to, the outrage perpetrated by its public servant in the
                            execution of his public functions.</p>
                        <p>The simple complaint of this Government is, that an officer of justice of
                            Venezuela, in the exercise of his official functions, subjected an
                            American citizen, whom he had arrested on suspicion, to grievous bodily
                            torture to extort from him a confession of guilt. For this act this
                            Government asks the punishment of the offender, and expects that
                            Venezuela will tender an equitable indemnity to the victim.</p>
                        <p>The President is surprised at the tardy proposal of Venezuela, now for
                            the first time heard of in connection with the case, that Mr. Wheelock
                            shall seek redress at the hands of the high federal court. Even if he
                            had been disposed to consent to such a disposition of the matter in the
                            interest of friendship and harmony between the two countries, a casual
                            examination of the provisional decrees of 14th February, 1873,
                            concerning the rights and indemnification of foreigners, which prescribe
                            the procedure to which the complaint would be subjected, leads the
                            President to withhold his acceptance of such a resort.</p>
                        <p>This Government cannot waive the right of its citizens to claim
                            diplomatic protection as those decrees require. It cannot admit that if
                            the court shall deem the claim for indemnity exaggerated the American
                            claimant shall forfeit all rights and incur heavy fine or prolonged
                            imprisonment. It cannot consent to allow the court power to dismiss the
                            claim because more than two years have passed since the commission of
                            the injury. It cannot, in a word, regard those decrees as controlling
                            the equitable or moral rights of an injured American citizen.</p>
                        <p>I have remarked that more than two years elapsed before any judicial
                            resort of Venezuela admitted that Sotillo was even liable to process.
                            Permit me to ask, in no captious spirit, how it is supposed Mr. Wheelock
                            would have fared had he submitted to those provisional decrees in the
                            face of the solemn adjudication of three judicial tribunals of Venezuela
                            that no grounds existed for subjecting the commissary, Sotillo, to legal
                            process? Would fine and imprisonment have been added to the wrong under
                            which he already lay? If so, would it not have been alleged that
                            diplomatic redress was effectually barred to him by reason of his
                            voluntary submission to the operation of those decrees?</p>
                        <p>A copy of the present correspondence will be sent to the United States
                            minister at Caracas with instructions to say that this Government does
                            not accept the reply made to its representations, and that it renews its
                            demand for the punishment of the offender, and repeats its expectation
                            that the Government of Venezuela will tender to Mr. Wheelock a just
                            indemnification.</p>
                        <p>Accept, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Most Excellent Sir</hi>: I have the honor to
                            acknowledge the receipt of your excellency’s communication of the 4th
                            instant. I think that its contents require some observations on my part,
                            which I trust will be favorably received, since they are dictated by a
                            sincere desire to bring about the most cordial understanding in respect
                            to the point in question.</p>
                        <p>I return my sincere thanks for the complimentary expressions whereby your
                            excellency recognizes my efforts to bring to a final settlement the
                            claim of the citizen Wheelock, when I was not aware of its importance,
                            nor of its intimate relation with certain grave complications, nor with
                            the institutions of vital importance for Venezuela in common with the
                            other sister republics of the continent, which, if disregarded, would
                            precipitate us into difficulties of all kinds, greater than that which
                            we should have avoided.</p>
                        <p>In order to proceed methodically, I shall begin my observations in the
                            order of the arguments and conclusions of the communication to which I
                            propose to reply.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency infers from my note and from that of his Excellency
                            President Guzman Blanco, which accompanied it, that the Government of
                            Venezuela does not recognize the right of this Government to have
                            recourse to diplomacy in order to secure the redress of a wrong suffered
                            by one of its citizens, who has been maltreated under circumstances of
                            peculiar cruelty. This assertion is not sustainable in this absolute and
                            isolated form. What his Excellency thus maintains in the case in
                            question is precisely what has been maintained by the United States,
                            which have been our model since the very establishment of their
                            independence, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi>, that foreigners entering a
                            country become subject, <hi rend="italic">ipso facto</hi>, to the laws
                            of that country, which they are under obligations to respect and obey
                            during the whole time of their residence there, and if they suffer
                            injuries they are under the absolute necessity of seeking redress
                            therefor, according to the usual legal methods, before the competent
                            courts of the nation. They are not to have immediate recourse to
                            diplomacy or to prefer international complaints unless they have
                            exhausted all ordinary methods.</p>
                        <p>In cases in which they think that they have ground for a complaint
                            against the Government for offenses received from public officers, with
                            the sanction or approbation of the Government, or in pursuance of its
                            orders, they must have recourse to the high federal court, which is a
                            tribunal in every respect equal in its attributes and powers to the
                            United States Court of Claims, and the same methods are to be pursued as
                            in this country. Just as in this Republic, recourse to the Department of
                            State would be considered irregular in the case of any injury done the
                            citizens of another nation with a view of securing pecuniary
                            compensation and the punishment of the parties implicated in the
                            offense, without taking the trouble to have recourse to the courts of
                            justice, or to present sufficient proofs or anything more than a simple
                            statement of the party, so is such a proceeding considered by the laws
                            of Venezuela. Such is likewise the doctrine of the United States,
                            especially <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0703"/>in regard to the
                            exclusion of diplomacy in cases in which the cognizance of such cases
                            belongs to the courts of justice. This was claimed by his excellency Mr.
                            Seijas, minister of foreign relations, in his note to his excellency Mr.
                            Baker, bearing date of August 23, 1881, which was recently published
                            here, and the arguments of which I think proper to reproduce at the
                            present time.</p>
                        <p>Attorney-General Randolph, in his report in relation to the case of
                            Pagan, a British subject, February 22, 1792, confirms my statement in
                            regard to abstention from recourse to diplomacy in cases which properly
                            belong to the courts, and both in this and the other matters to which I
                            have called attention he is in accord with Webster, who in the case of
                            the New Orleans riot in 1851 refused indemnity to Spanish citizens and
                            only allowed it to the consul of Spain in view of his special
                            character.</p>
                        <p>The aforesaid note mentions the observations of Attorney-General Cushing
                            in the case of the bark Eliza, May 27, 1855, in which he shows that the
                            United states are not responsible for the failure of an American pilot
                            who caused it to run aground, and shows that every country has power to
                            legislate in regard to the condition of foreigners, and to compel them
                            to obey the laws, as well as the duty to observe international rules
                            towards the Spanish American states, with respect to which he says:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    and in others with very doubtful discretion or justice. This has
                                    aggravated the evils of misgovernment there, as will palpably
                                    appear to any one carefully studying the international condition
                                    of the Republics of South America.</p>

                        <p>The reflections which I have just made render it unnecessary for me to
                            demonstrate to your excellency that if Venezuela, in the matter of the
                            claims of foreigners residing in her territory, whether permanently
                            domiciled or not, considers them as being subject to its laws, and
                            allows them the same means of redress that it does to its own citizens,
                            following the example of the laws and practices of the United States, it
                            cannot be said that that country has devised any method peculiarly its
                            own that is not based upon the law of nations and upon the practices of
                            this great Republic, in order to debar foreigners who have suffered
                            injury from having recourse to the diplomatic intervention of their
                            respective Governments, and to compel them to submit their complaints to
                            the competent local tribunals.</p>
                        <p>Suppose, your excellency, that during the excitement consequent upon the
                            discovery of gold in California, whenever an injury was done to one of
                            the many foreigners who rushed to that distant region, the diplomatic
                            ministers of the nations to which the aggrieved parties belonged had
                            addressed the Department of State, demanding pecuniary redress, such as
                            is asked in the present case, and the punishment of the delinquent, even
                            though the latter had been a police officer of the place, having charge
                            of purely local matters. If this would have been inadmissible at that
                            time, and is so now, has been, and will ever be so in this country,
                            there have not been wanting those who have sought to impose it upon the
                            Spanish American Republics. All have hitherto resisted it by themselves
                            alone, and all have endeavored to protect themselves by their laws, to
                            the extent that some have endeavored to establish as a constitutional
                            rule the principle that foreigners shall be subject to the laws of the
                            country receiving them into its territory. The rule being one of
                            international law, it seems scarcely necessary to mention <pb n="604"
                                xml:id="pg_604" facs="0704"/>it in the laws or constitutions, save
                            for greater clearness and definiteness.</p>
                        <p>Nothing would be more dangerous than to allow to foreigners the privilege
                            of burdening a nation with enormous international payments for every
                            injury received by them or to relieve them from the obligation of having
                            recourse to the courts to establish the truth of their allegations and
                            the real rights of the parties. Your excellency will admit, with my
                            Government, that foreigners entering the territory of a nation cannot
                            claim greater or more important concessions of individual liberty and of
                            local protection than the natives themselves, and that there would be no
                            reason to impose upon it the burden of a more special guarantee because
                            of any accident to those who, retaining their foreign nationality,
                            reside in the republic. It is impossible to deny the principle of
                            jurisprudence which extends the protection of a government to its
                            citizens whithersoever they may go.</p>
                        <p>It is, however, to be understood that such protection in nowise relieves
                            them from the duties and obligations contracted by them, particularly
                            from that of obeying its laws, since two opposing sovereignties be
                            admissible at the same time. In such a collision the sovereignty of the
                            place would naturally have to be recognized, because a foreigner could
                            never arrogate to himself more favorable conditions than the native in
                            his own home. In the case of the present claim it cannot be said that
                            there has been any denial of justice, because what has not been asked
                            cannot have been denied. The complainant has not appeared before any
                            Venezuelan court asking for the punishment of the party who injured him,
                            or for the pecuniary redress of his wrongs. On the contrary, as soon as
                            he was released on the ground of the insufficiency of the charges of G.
                            Patroni who caused his arrest, and who was likewise an American citizen,
                            he at once addressed the consul of the United States in the capital of
                            the State, instead of having recourse to the courts. He next went to the
                            island of Trinidad, whence he requested the United States minister at
                            Caracas, by letter, to cause the Government of Venezuela to pay him an
                            indemnity of $50,000. He then came to the United States, where he
                            continued urging the Department of State, and afterwards the American
                            Congress, to procure for him an indemnity of $250,000 for the injury
                            suffered by him and for the Venezuelan Government’s delay in making
                            payments of the first claim.</p>
                        <p>Where constitutional powers are divided as they are here, the Executive
                            is not the proper officer to hear the complaints of private citizens,
                            whether native or foreign. They must substantiate their claims before
                            the courts specially charged with the administration of justice, and of
                            the forms, without which there is no possibility of discerning facts or
                            law. I have not studied or had an opportunity to render myself
                            thoroughly familiar with the cases cited by your excellency of the
                            damages claimed by French citizens, and am consequently unable to
                            appreciate their resemblance to the present case.</p>
                        <p>When I said, in my note of February 11, that Venezuela had been obliged
                            to raise a barrier to the ruinous abuses introduced as diplomatic
                            claims, I cannot have stated that it had had recourse to any other
                            methods than to the sound principles of public law in the same manner as
                            other powers; still less that it had disregarded the rules of conduct
                            which should be observed by all members of the great family of
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>The argument that its courts had not furnished an adequate remedy to
                            foreigners for injuries suffered by them could scarcely be admitted in
                            any State.</p>
                        <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0705"/>
                        <p>In the case in question the claimant did not appear for the purpose of
                            demanding the punishment of the party who had injured him, or the
                            pecuniary redress to which he thought himself entitled, before any
                            Venezuelan court. If such a thing should occur here, and if, when the
                            case was commenced before a court, the injured party had not appeared,
                            no one would consider as a denial of justice the declaration of such a
                            court that there was no ground for the continuance of the case owing to
                            the lack of an interested party and of the <hi rend="italic">corps du
                                délit.</hi></p>
                        <p>When this happened, owing to the absence of the aggrieved party, both the
                            President of the State of Guayana, where the case occurred, on which
                            Wheelock’s claim is based, and the President of the Republic, took,
                            each, in his turn, all measures within the sphere of their powers to
                            secure the arrest and punishment of the offender.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the absence of Wheelock, the aggrieved party, and of the
                            difficulty of proving his statements, as he admits in his published
                            letters, and as is admitted by all, sufficient evidence was secured
                            after a most persistent and very careful investigation, to justify the
                            courts in ordering the arrest of the offender and the seizure of his
                            property.</p>
                        <p>No pains have been spared by the Government to bring the guilty party to
                            justice, yet he has succeeded in effecting is escape. The good name of
                            the Republic, and a solemn conviction of what was its duty, rendered
                            this a task that had to be performed.</p>
                        <p>The means are not yet exhausted, most excellent sir, which have been and
                            which will be used by Venezuela until the culprit is brought to justice.
                            From the very outset, however, my Government has deeply regretted to be
                            obliged to differ from that of your excellency in respect to pecuniary
                            indemnities due from it on account of injuries done to individuals by
                            persons not acting under its orders, much less with its sanction or
                            approval. In my humble opinion, it is only in cases in which
                            subordinates act in pursuance of the orders of their Government or with
                            its approval, that their acts render the nation responsible to
                            foreigners and to foreign Governments. An act performed by a public
                            officer, especially by a mere commissary of police, whose grade is the
                            lowest in the municipal and local department, entails no obligation of
                            an international character, unless the officer obeys, in the performance
                            of such act, orders received by him from his Government. Although this
                            circumstance, in your excellency’s opinion, is entitled to no
                            consideration, I am glad to see that the fact is acknowledged that my
                            Government neither ordered, sanctioned, nor had the slightest knowledge
                            of the outrage which is the basis of this claim.</p>
                        <p>If his Excellency the President of Venezuela has pointed out the proper
                            course for the aggrieved party to pursue, and has not himself brought
                            the case before the courts of justice, he has taken this course for the
                            sole purpose of pointing out the real means of redress furnished by the
                            laws in such cases.</p>
                        <p>I do not think that this case has by any means reached what may be
                            considered as a denial of justice, for the reason which I have already
                            stated, <hi rend="italic">i. e</hi>., that there can be no denial where
                            there is no petition. The applications which have been made by the
                            complainant to the authorities of his nation will doubtless be
                            considered as a petition, as will also the demands made by the United
                            States Government of the ministry of foreigns relation of Caracas and of
                            the president of the State of Guayana, who have done and are still doing
                            all in their power to bring the guilty party to justice as a criminal;
                            because, as regards pecuniary redress, it was scarcely necessary to tell
                            officers of a republican government, where the attributes of the various
                            administrative branches are <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0706"
                            />perfectly well defined, that <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was a matter
                            with which they had nothing to do, and that if the party interested
                            desired to obtain the amount claimed by him, it was necessary for him to
                            bring his case before the courts of the country, just like any other
                            private individual.</p>
                        <p>When the national Government was addressed, at the beginning of the
                            controversy, in relation to the indemnity claimed in this case, his
                            excellency Mr. Saavedra informed the diplomatic representative of the
                            United States at Caracas, in his note of August 24, 1880, that the
                            nation was not bound to pay any indemnity. In the concluding portion of
                            the published translation of that note, the following passage occurs:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The Government thinks that, if there has actually been a crime,
                                    the obligation of the Republic is satisfied by the judgment and
                                    punishment of its authors, and <hi rend="italic">that it would
                                        not owe pecuniary indemnification to the offended.</hi></p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>As it is not customary in this country to have recourse to the Executive
                            for the redress of grievances or for the substantiation of cases in
                            which private individuals are concerned, and as the courts are open to
                            both natives and foreigners in Venezuela, without restriction, it can be
                            said neither there nor here that the Executive dispenses or denies
                            justice, in a forensic or international sense.</p>
                        <p>It seems superfluous to remark that the adverse decision of the courts
                            cannot be considered as notorious injustice, when there is no absolute
                            evidence of the sufficiency of the proofs presented. Nothing of the kind
                            occurred, however, or could occur, for the reason that the party
                            interested, whose presence was necessary in a case in which pecuniary
                            indemnity was claimed on account of personal injury, left the place a
                            very few days subsequently to the perpetration of the outrage, without
                            bringing his case before the courts at all, so that a petition which was
                            never presented cannot have been denied.</p>
                        <p>I regard as inadmissible the conclusion, in the note now under
                            consideration, that there have been three repeated denials of justice,
                            because, in the case of the proceedings instituted against Eusebio
                            Sotillo, the accused, who was prosecuted on a criminal charge,
                            declarations, were made by the inferior courts to the effect that there
                            was not sufficient cause for his arrest or for the continuance of the
                            case. Is there anything strange in this, when the injured party absented
                            himself and declared it impossible to secure proof, as he did in the

                        <p>Sir: I have had the honor to receive your note of the 10th instant in
                            relation to the claim of Mr. John E. Wheelock against Venezuela.</p>
                        <p>After a careful consideration of your arguments, I am obliged to
                            relinquish the task of refuting them in detail. The groundwork on which
                            they rest being fallacious, the whole argument falls. You proceed on the
                            assumption that the high federal court, to which it is assumed that Mr.
                            Wheelock should have in the first instance submitted his claim, is a
                            tribunal in every respect equal in its attributes and powers to the
                            United States Court of Claims, and from this you infer that the
                            jurisdiction of the two countries in this particular is identical, and
                            that Venezuela prescribes for the injured alien the same judicial
                            resorts as do the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Court of Claims, however, permit me to say, has no jurisdiction of
                            the cases of aliens making claims of the nature of Mr. Wheelock’s. It
                            has only jurisdiction of alien claims founded on statute or contract.
                            There is no tribunal here which is competent to render judgment against
                            the United States for personal damages occasioned by the act of a
                            federal officer.</p>
                        <p>As I stated in my note of the 4th instant, those are matters for
                            diplomatic settlement, and in default of agreement thereon by friendly
                            arbitration.</p>
                        <p>I observe also that you take exception to my statement that the
                            Government of Venezuela does not recognize the right of this Government
                            to have recourse to diplomacy in order to secure the redress of a wrong
                            suffered by one of its citizens who has been maltreated under
                            circumstances of peculiar cruelty. Permit me to remind you that the
                            representations of this Government have uniformly been confined, as a
                            demand, to asking the execution of Venezuelan law against the
                            aggressor.</p>
                        <p>Your Government claims that there has been no miscarriage of justice in
                            the case. We think and aver that at every step of the case there has
                            been an evident miscarriage of justice. As to the claim for indemnity,
                            we have not demanded a fixed sum. We have diplomatically represented to.
                            Venezuela that the circumstances appear to fully warrant the expectation
                            that a tender of compensation for the wrong suffered will be voluntarily
                            made to Mr. Wheelock.</p>
                        <p>Your Government pays no heed to this temperate and just suggestion, so
                            put forth, and attempts to relegate the sufferer to the courts to the
                            country. This seems to be a practical denial of the diplomatic recourse
                            even for the amicable settlement of a question which this Government
                            felt reluctant to press to the graver stage of a positively formulated
                            demand for indemnity.</p>
                        <p>It has been the consistent effort of this Government, in dealing with
                            this case, to keep the channel of diplomatic adjustment open. If it be
                            closed by the Venezuelan Government denying our recourse thereto, our
                            regret would be most keen, but at the same time the responsibility would
                            not be ours.</p>
                        <p>This further correspondence in the ease will now be submitted to
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>Accept, &amp;c.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In compliance with my request you were so
                            good as to favor me with an interview this morning, when I took occasion
                            to advert to a recent occurence at Ciudad Bolivar, whereby Mr. John
                            Dalton, the consul of the United States at that point, together with
                            some twenty other persons of that place, had been by an executive order
                            of his excellency President Guzman Blanco, subjected to three days
                            incarceration in the military barracks, and I expressed to you the
                            painful effects which such action would impose upon the Government of
                            the United States if it were found that such an arbitrary proceeding had
                            in fact been enforced against any citizen of the United States,
                            especially one holding a consular appointment under our flag.</p>
                        <p>You were pleased to state the facts of the occurrence as they had been
                            communicated to you. Briefly, a recent federal law of Venezuela has
                            granted certain extensive rights and usufructs over tracts of unoccupied
                            Government land to a foreign citizen or association, the grant carrying
                            with it commercial privileges at Ciudad Bolivar; a number of respectable
                            residents of that city, among them Mr. Dalton, joined in signing a
                            protest against the provisions of this grant. The language of the
                            protest is said by you to have been severe and in effect subversive of
                            the law, which the signers were bound to obey and respect; and moreover,
                            the petition or protest was printed in the local papers before it
                            reached the Government at Caracas; in view of all which you say the
                            Venezuelan Executive adopted a recourse allowable in that country and
                            undertook to enforce respect for the laws by ordering the military
                            arrest for the constitutional term of three days, of all those who by
                            their action had shown disrespect to the law and the Government.</p>
                        <p>It seems that Mr. Baker has already addressed a remonstrance to the
                            Venezuelan secretary for foreign affairs, and elicited from Mr. Seijas
                            an unsatisfactory reply.</p>
                        <p>From your statement of the occurrences, I must consider Mr. Baker’s
                            remonstrance to have been warranted by the facts and I deem it my duty
                            to say also to you, as the accredited representative of Venezuela, that
                            this Government would and does feel bound to protest against any summary
                            act of the Executive of Venezuela, whereby any citizen of the United
                            States may have been, or may be, subjected to military condemnation and
                            sentence to any term of imprisonment, however brief, without due form of
                            trial and opportunity for defense under the treaty of 1860, and under
                            the accepted principles of international law.</p>
                        <p>It is sincerely hoped, however, that the executive order of President
                            Guzman Blanco will not be found to have been enforced against any
                            citizen of the United States. Until that material fact is known, I
                            reserve further comment in the matter.</p>

                            of yesterday, calling my attention to the long pending and still
                            unsettled claim of Mr. John E. Wheelock; to the conversation held upon
                            the subject with his Excellency General Guzman Blanco, during his recent
                            visit to the Department of State, and asking me if I am prepared for the
                            definitive settlement of the case, it being the desire of the President
                            of the Republic to have it settled before the meeting of Congress in

                            to be set aside.</p>
