                                    although they looked innocent, Japan, if China accepted, would
                                    be free to claim that most any demand it made was within the
                                    meaning of these terms and that China could not accept these
                                    terms as a basis of negotiation. He said that any person who had
                                    watched the actions of Japanese military leaders in China during
                                    the last few months would understand the purposes hidden behind

                            <p>2. My 1, January 1, 10 p.m. While Hsu Mo was with me, Gage,
                                representative of British Embassy, came in and in my presence Hsu Mo
                                handed to him copy of terms which he had given me. He said to Gage
                                that he understood that Chinese Ambassador had seen Cadogan<note
                                    n="8" xml:id="d2fn8">Sir Alexander M. G. Cadogan, British

                                who had remarked that China could of course not accept these terms.
                                Hsu made same comments about terms to Gage that he had made to
                                me.</p>
                            <p>In general conversation which followed, Gage remarked to Hsu Mo that
                                this explained why German Ambassador had been depressed during the
                                past few days. He said that German Ambassador had said to him
                                yesterday “Why do you continue to encourage the Chinese to fight the
                                Japanese” and Gage commented that of course no nation was
                                encouraging the Chinese to fight the Japanese. Hsu said “The German
                                Ambassador should urge the Japanese not to fight the Chinese”.</p>
                            <p>After the departure of Hsu, Gage said to me that he had met German
                                Ambassador at the house of the principal German military adviser
                                Falkenhausen yesterday at which time question was asked. Gage stated
                                that apparently the German Government was recalling <pb n="3"
                                    xml:id="pg_3" facs="0007"/>all of the German advisers. He said
                                that adviser Krummacher said to him that he and Falkenhausen were
                                remaining with the Chinese no matter what the German Government
                                thought or did about it.</p>
                            <p>I dined at the house of a German friend last evening and found him
                                much wrought up over a German illustrated paper which he had just
                                received indicating that the press in Germany was propagating the
                                thought that the Japanese were indeed fighting communism in China,
                                using as evidence of this illustrations from Associated Press taken
                                in Communist areas of northwest China by Edgar Snow. He stated to me
                                that German Chamber of Commerce here in China had telegraphed home
                                trying to counteract this propaganda by pointing out that Japan was
                                driving the Chinese into the arms of Russia but without avail.</p>

                            <p>3. In a conversation today with the Chief of the Far Eastern Section
                                of the Foreign Office respecting the recently announced changes in
                                the Chinese Government, particularly as affecting Chiang Kai
                                    Shek,<note n="13" xml:id="d5fn13">Generalissimo Chiang retired
                                    in favor of Dr. H. H. Kung as President of the Chinese Executive
                                    Yuan (Premier).</note> he commented that Chinese internal
                                affairs were most difficult of interpretation but that he felt that
                                this change might have as a purpose the facilitating, with regard to
                                the personalities involved, direct relations with Japan.</p>
                            <p>With reference to press accounts that Germany through the German
                                Ambassador at Tokyo had made moves looking to act as mediator
                                between the two parties, von Schmieden denied that any such action
                                had been taken. He said that the German diplomatic representatives
                                in China and Japan were naturally discussing with their colleagues
                                and others the problem of the restoration of peace for which Germany
                                was most anxious. It was evident, however, that for Germany to
                                attempt to play the role of mediator before the time was auspicious
                                for a successful issue would not only serve no useful purpose but
                                would probably place Germany in a most difficult position vis-à-vis
                                both parties.</p>

                            <p>20. Leger<note n="14" xml:id="d6fn14">Secretary General of the French
                                    Foreign Office.</note> who in the absence of Delbos<note n="15"
                                    xml:id="d6fn15">French Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> is
                                in charge of the Foreign Office stated to me today that it was the
                                most ardent hope of the French Government that our Government might
                                not become involved in war in the Far East. He added that he made
                                this statement not for humanitarian reasons but because he felt
                                certain that if we should become involved in war against Japan the
                                British would be compelled to follow us and would be unable to act
                                in Europe. This would mean that the position of France in Europe
                                would be so greatly weakened that Germany and Italy would strike
                                immediately. France would be left to defend her frontiers and her
                                allies against the combined forces of Germany and Italy. That would
                                be beyond her strength. He felt certain therefore that the
                                involvement of the United States in war in the Far East would mean
                                catastrophe for France and for Europe.</p>
                            <p>Leger added that he knew there were various forces in England which
                                were doing their utmost by methods open and secret to persuade the
                                United States to act against Japan. He said that he had discussed
                                the possibilities of British action in the Far East at great length
                                with various English statesmen and diplomats recently. He could
                                assure me that there was not the slightest chance that England would
                                go to war with Japan no matter what insults she might receive from
                                Japan and no matter how serious might be Japanese aggression against
                                her interests and possessions in the Far East. The British
                                Government had no illusion that it could carry on a war successfully
                                in Chinese and Japanese waters. A joint action in which the United
                                States would carry the major portion of the burden would be quite
                                another matter.</p>
                            <p>His latest information from Russia was that the Russian Government
                                would continue supplying arms and munitions to Chiang Kai Shek but
                                positively would not become involved in the war.</p>
                            <p>He believed that Chiang Kai Shek probably would retire into Szechuan
                                and continue to fight but he was not sure that this was so. Chiang
                                Kai Shek unquestionably desired to continue the war and to avoid
                                negotiations but there were many other leaders in China who desired
                                to enter into negotiations. The Chinese had consented to receive
                                terms of peace from the hands of the German Ambassador in spite of
                                the advanced warnings of the French Foreign Office as to the <pb
                                    n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0010"/>nature of the terms. This
                                seemed to him to indicate that the will to continue fighting was not
                                so strong in China as he would like to see it.</p>
                            <p>Leger was less pessimistic than Chautemps<note n="16" xml:id="d6fn16"
                                    >Camille Chautemps, President of the French Council of Ministers
                                    (Premier).</note> with regard to the ultimate effects of Goga’s
                                appointment as Prime Minister of Rumania. He said that the King had
                                said to the French Minister in Bucharest that the Prime Minister
                                would have nothing to do either with foreign affairs or with
                                military affairs. He, the King, would control Rumanian policy in
                                both these fields and he would be entirely faithful to his
                                friendship with France. Leger stated that General Avarescu, the new
                                Rumanian Minister for War, had accepted the office only after
                                pledges from the Prime Minister and the King that the policy of
                                friendship with France should not be abandoned.</p>
                            <p>Finally, Leger stated that Goga himself had said to the French
                                Minister that both foreign affairs and military affairs were not
                                under his control but under the control of the King. Leger added
                                that the military supplies which France had promised to Rumania
                                would continue to be sent to Rumania; but would be delivered with an
                                eye-dropper, very little at a time in return for good behavior.</p>
                            <p>Leger insisted that accord was now perfect between France and England
                                with regard to the policies to be pursued vis-à-vis Germany and
                                Italy. Chamberlain<note n="17" xml:id="d6fn17">Neville Chamberlain,
                                    British Prime Minister.</note> was as convinced as the French
                                Government that no acceptable agreement could be made with
                                    Mussolini<note n="18" xml:id="d6fn18">Italian Prime
                                    Minister.</note> unless an agreement should have been made
                                previously with Germany. The French and British Governments while
                                continuing to rearm as fast as possible would therefore speak softly
                                and amiably to Germany and ignore Italy.</p>

                                information on the present point of view of the Soviet Government
                                with regard to the Chinese-Japanese conflict. The Soviet Union would
                                continue to assist China with supplies but would not enter the war
                                unless either the United States or Great Britain should be drawn
                                into war with Japan. He was certain that if Great Britain should be
                                compelled to fight Japan the Soviet Union would make war on Japan at
                                once.</p>

                            <p>Blum said that he had read only a <hi rend="italic">précis</hi> of

                                but that there was enough in the <hi rend="italic">précis</hi> to
                                convince him that no progress could be made along the lines
                                suggested by Van Zeeland. He felt certain that neither Germany nor
                                Italy would stop its movement toward autarchy and he believed that
                                any proposal which involved negotiations between England, France,
                                Germany and Italy, even with the addition of the United States,
                                smacked too much of the old Four Power Treaty to be acceptable to
                                democratic opinion anywhere in Europe. He said that he would expect
                                great opposition to this in Europe to say nothing of the opposition
                                from Poland, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia.</p>

                            <p>The British Ambassador called to see me this morning. The Ambassador
                                gave me first copies of some confidential information transmitted to
                                him by his Government with regard to recent developments within
                                Russia. I told the Ambassador I was most grateful for the
                                information he thus gave me, although he said that he was afraid
                                there was not much that we would find of value in it.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador then said that he had just received a cable from his
                                Foreign Office stating that the incident which occurred yesterday,
                                involving the beating of four British police officers within the
                                International Concession by Japanese soldiers, was regarded as
                                extremely grave by the British Government. The Foreign Office had as
                                yet received only preliminary information. If this preliminary
                                information was confirmed, the British Government would probably
                                find it necessary to do more than merely accept an apology from the
                                Japanese Government. The British Government was considering “an
                                announcement of the completion of naval preparations”. I asked the
                                Ambassador what interpretation was to be given to this phrase. He
                                said that it was to be regarded as a step prior to mobilization and
                                as implying that the British Navy was on a war-footing, save for the
                                completion of naval complements, which latter was a step that would
                                be undertaken solely as a result of mobilization. The British
                                Ambassador desired to know whether in the event that such an
                                announcement was made by the British Government, the Government of
                                the United States would be prepared to make some similar gesture,
                                which <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0012"/>might, the Ambassador
                                said, in the opinion of his Government be some move such as the
                                announcement that certain units of the United States Navy were
                                proceeding towards Hawaii in the course of naval maneuvers, or that
                                certain units of the United States Navy were being moved from the
                                Atlantic to the Pacific.</p>
                            <p>I replied to the Ambassador that the inquiry was one which could
                                necessarily only be answered after the Secretary of State or I had
                                consulted the President in the matter. The Ambassador said that he
                                fully understood, but hoped that we could give him a reply the first
                                days of next week.<note n="21" xml:id="d8fn21">See memorandum of
                                    January 13, <ref target="#pg_19">p. 19</ref>.</note> He
                                emphasized that the inquiry was, of course, a hypothetical question,
                                contingent upon whether the British Government considered the
                                incident in Shanghai as sufficiently serious to warrant such a
                                move.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador spoke in a general way about recent developments in
                                Italy and said that he had learned from his Government that an
                                agreement in principle had been reached between Count Ciano<note
                                    n="22" xml:id="d8fn22">Italian Minister for Foreign
                                    Affairs.</note> and Lord Perth, the British Ambassador in Rome,
                                whereby the broadcasting to the Near Eastern countries now being
                                pursued both by the British and Italian Governments would be
                                restricted solely to the announcement of factual news items with the
                                elimination of inflammatory propaganda. The Ambassador said his
                                Government felt that if this agreement was adhered to, the tension
                                between Italy and Great Britain would be relieved to a very
                                considerable extent.</p>

                            <p>17. In the course of my conversation on various subjects with the
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning he said that I might like
                                to know of certain rumors and reports which had reached him.</p>
                            <p>1. He said that reports were circulating in Japan to the effect that
                                certain American bankers, unspecified, are considering or have
                                decided to advance credits to the Chinese Government to the extent
                                of 150,000,000 gold dollars to help China pay her debts and to
                                stabilize the Chinese currency and at the same time certain English
                                bankers were considering similar action to the extent of 30,000,000
                                pounds. The Minister did not say whether he had definite
                                confirmation of the accuracy of these rumors.</p>
                            <p>2. Hirota then turned to the question of peace negotiations with
                                China and said that before the Brussels Conference he had suggested
                                to the American, British, German and Italian Ambassadors that Chiang
                                Kai Shek should take the initiative in approaching the Japanese
                                Government for peace negotiations. About December 27 the German
                                Ambassador in Tokyo had asked Hirota if he would state the Japanese
                                peace terms which could be conveyed to Chiang Kai Shek through
                                Ambassador Trautmann and that Hirota had then stated the Japanese
                                terms as follows: <list>

                                        communism.</item>

                                </list></p>
                            <p>I asked the Minister if he would care to elaborate on these various
                                points. He said that the demilitarized zones should be created in
                                Inner Mongolia, North China and the district now occupied by
                                Japanese forces south of the Yangtze River between Shanghai and
                                Nanking. Inner Mongolia was to have an autonomous government under
                                sovereignty of the Chinese Central Government. The regimes in the
                                other demilitarized zones were to have a considerable degree of
                                autonomous power but they also would be under Chinese sovereignty.
                                As for an economic settlement this would include the development of
                                China’s natural resources and also a tariff agreement with
                                Japan.</p>
                            <p>3. Hirota said he was aware that Kung had approached the American
                                Government through Ambassador Wang to ask the American Government’s
                                advice with regard to the acceptance of these terms and also to
                                request the mediation of President Roosevelt. Hirota <pb n="11"
                                    xml:id="pg_11" facs="0015"/>said that the Japanese Government
                                had asked the Chinese Government for its reply to these terms about
                                January 10th and that they were now awaiting a reply at any moment.
                                Hirota said that he was telling me this merely because he thought I
                                would like to be informed with regard to the situation.</p>
                            <p>4. The foregoing probably indicates the significance to be attached
                                to reports published this morning in the papers that the Cabinet
                                yesterday agreed on the principle that so long as “China manifests
                                no desire to seek a settlement on a basis which will safeguard the
                                peace of East Asia, Japan has no alternative but to resolve to face
                                a war of endurance”. It is reported also that various measures such
                                as declaration of war and withdrawal of recognition of the Chinese
                                Government were discussed but not agreed upon. The Cabinet will
                                reportedly decide today whether the Emperor will be requested to
                                call a special conference to consider what measures should be taken
                                to implement the principle above described.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Mallet, Counselor of the British Embassy, called at his request.
                                He stated that according to a cable from the British Foreign Office
                                the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs told Craigie<note n="26"
                                    xml:id="d12fn26">Sir Robert L. Craigie, British Ambassador in

                                to the American Government in regard to the Japanese peace terms
                                which had been communicated to the Chinese Government through the
                                German Ambassador in China. Mr. Mallet inquired whether we could
                                inform him of the facts.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mallet was informed that this probably had reference to peace
                                terms which had been communicated in confidence to our Ambassador at
                                Hankow by the Chinese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, as reported
                                in the Embassy’s 1, January 1, 10 p.m. Mr. Mallet was also informed
                                that on December 31 the Chinese Ambassador at Washington had
                                informed the President of the Japanese peace terms and that the
                                President had made no comment thereon. As the Chinese <pb n="12"
                                    xml:id="pg_12" facs="0016"/>had informed Ambassador Johnson that
                                they considered the Japanese peace terms unacceptable this would
                                appear to have ruled out any occasion for comment by our Ambassador
                                on those terms.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Ballantine called up Mr. Mallet by telephone and stated that
                                subsequent to Mr. Mallet’s visit to the Department this morning a
                                telegram had been received from our Embassy at Tokyo stating that
                                the Ambassador had been informed by the Japanese Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs that about December 27 the German Ambassador had
                                asked Hirota if he would state the Japanese peace terms which could
                                be conveyed to Chiang Kai-shek through Ambassador Trautmann, and
                                that Hirota had then stated the Japanese peace terms which Hirota
                                had repeated to our Ambassador and which were the same as those
                                communicated to Ambassador Johnson by the Chinese Vice Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Ballantine also told Mr. Mallet the contents of the first
                                paragraph of Hankow’s 2, January 2, 10 a.m., regarding the
                                communication of the Japanese peace terms by the Chinese Vice
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs to Gage, the representative at Hankow
                                of the British Embassy.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mallet did not ask for and was not given the text of the Japanese
                                terms.</p>

                                    China.</note> had with Hsu Mo recently, latter stated that a
                                reply might be communicated to the Japanese Government through the
                                German Ambassador within 2 or 3 days. So far as I know this has not
                                been done. Vice Minister stated that it would be impossible for the
                                Chinese Government to accept these terms or to surrender to the
                                Japanese Government in any way; that Generalissimo was firm in his
                                determination that China should continue resistance; that if Chinese
                                Government were to consent to terms dictated by Japan chaos would
                                result as country would not support the Government. Vice Minister
                                stated that all important persons and sections of Chinese Government
                                were firm in their belief that China had no choice but to resist
                                Japan as long as possible. They believed that the farther that the
                                Japanese forces advanced into the interior of China the more
                                effective would <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0017"/>China’s
                                resistance become. He stated that Chinese Government still cherished
                                expectation that if resistance was continued long enough and if
                                Japanese disruption of American and British interests extended to
                                all parts of the country, the United States and Great Britain would
                                finally take joint action to restrain Japan’s lawless acts. Peck
                                endeavored to disabuse Hsu Mo of any such expectation as regards
                                future policy of the United States, but although Hsu Mo stated that
                                he personally realized this, it is doubtful whether he really has
                                given up any such hopes.</p>

                                    the Admiral’s recently published explanation of reasons for
                                    anti-British feeling in Japan, a policy aimed at eliminating
                                    occidental influence and interests from China. I am even
                                    convinced that the action of Japanese soldiers at Nanking who
                                    carried out mass executions of Chinese soldiers that had given
                                    up their arms to certain foreigners of the committee which
                                    organized the safety zone for noncombatants, was partly
                                    motivated by a desire to convince the Chinese that they must not
                                    depend upon white intervention in their opinions. We appear to
                                    face a group of young Japanese <hi rend="italic">ronin</hi> who
                                    tolerate no control from Tokyo and who will be found to be
                                    recklessly contemptuous of any adverse effect which their
                                    actions in China may have upon Japan’s relations with Western
                                    Powers, in the belief that the rest of the world is not prepared
                                    to do more than register a protest against violation of treaties
                                    relating to the Far East and to the rights and interests of

                                <item>The Imperial Conference met at 2 o’clock this afternoon and
                                    adjourned after 1 hour’s deliberation. A bulletin issued to the
                                    press stated briefly that the conference approved the principle
                                    adopted by the Cabinet (see paragraph 4 of telegram above
                                    cited). An official in the Foreign Office informed us in reply
                                    to request for amplification of the bulletin that contrary to a
                                    rumor now current that a full statement would be given to the
                                    press of today’s proceedings nothing would be given out “for the

                                    the trend of the discussion at the conference. As relatively
                                    full accounts have been given out of recent Cabinet meetings, in
                                    which it was made clear that there was a division of opinion on
                                    the question of a declaration of war, but that full agreement
                                    prevails on the basic policy of carrying on the hostilities to a
                                    successful conclusion, the brevity of today’s proceedings does
                                    not suggest that decision was taken to declare war. If a
                                    decision was reached to take any action of a concrete nature the
                                    probabilities are that it would involve <hi rend="italic">de

                                he is quoting an absolutely reliable source that the purpose of the
                                recent Imperial Conference was to approve revised and final peace
                                terms to China and that these terms involving various unspecified
                                concessions on the part of Japan were approved by the Emperor and
                                would therefore become “immutable”. It was not expected that China
                                would accept the original terms but if these revised terms are now
                                rejected the campaign will then be pursued to a finish. Informant
                                stated that the emphasis of the conference was therefore on peace
                                rather than on war and that peace is greatly desired.</p>
                            <p>Informant stated that Admiral Suetsugu was alone in the Cabinet in
                                favoring a declaration of war and that such a proposal therefore did
                                not come before the Emperor. The Cabinet wishes at almost any cost
                                to avoid involving the United States, a risk which a blockade of
                                China would entail through the possible sinking of American merchant

                            <p>10. Reference general considerations and your 23, January 12, 11 p.m.
                                It has occurred to the Department that possibly a useful purpose
                                might be served if there could be conveyed to the Japanese
                                Government at this time when the Imperial Conference has under
                                consideration matters of the gravest import, mention of points as
                                follows: that the eyes of the world are on Japan; that the nature of
                                the decisions reached by the Conference may have a profound effect
                                upon the welfare and the prosperity of the whole world; that the
                                fighting which has been going on in China for the past 6 months has
                                seriously disturbed all normal and mutually beneficial activities in
                                and with regard to China; that the fighting is producing political
                                and economic and social dislocations and tensions which affect
                                adversely not only China and Japan but other countries as well; that
                                there is no way by which the other countries of the world or even
                                Japan can escape various adverse effects of and from the present
                                conflict, and that prolongation and further extension and
                                intensification of the hostilities will inevitably increase the
                                concern of other nations which suffer from these adverse effects and
                                add to the chance of unfortunate international complications; that
                                we are convinced that practical application of the principles of
                                policy set forth in my statement of July 16<note n="32"

                                in the best interests of Japan as well as of other countries; and
                                that we earnestly hope that the decisions of the Japanese Government
                                will be fully in keeping with the best traditions of wise,
                                high-minded and farseeing Japanese statesmanship.</p>
                            <p>I realize that the question of making such an approach to the
                                Japanese Government at this time is a delicate one and that it is
                                highly desirable that there be avoided an appearance of foreign
                                intrusion into questions of internal Japanese political
                                deliberations. It is possible, however, that a friendly talk by you
                                with the Minister for Foreign Affairs along the lines indicated
                                might be fruitful of more of good than of harm.</p>
                            <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0021"/>
                            <p>I wish you to use your own discretion both as to whether such an
                                approach as I have outlined should be made and, if your decision be
                                in the affirmative, as to whether you should speak on your own
                                initiative or as under instruction from your Government.</p>

                            <p>11. A Chief of Mission here of a State having interests in the Far
                                East showed me last evening a copy of a despatch which the
                                diplomatic representative of his country at London had addressed to
                                his Government which recounted the following: Eden<note n="33"
                                    xml:id="d19fn33">Anthony Eden, British Secretary of State for
                                    Foreign Affairs.</note> before leaving for the Riviera had asked
                                him to come to see him and had stated that he believed it to be
                                highly possible that the Japanese would attack Hong Kong and that in
                                such a case Great Britain would certainly declare war on Japan. Eden
                                had added that London was in daily touch with Washington and that he
                                entertained hopes that in such an eventuality Great Britain could
                                count on the military support of the United States.</p>
                            <p>My informant said that he had shown me the despatch in strict
                                confidence as he wanted to obtain my views on possible American
                                action in the circumstances envisaged.</p>
                            <p>I told him in reply that as far as American public opinion was
                                concerned, in view of the strained relations in the Far East, the
                                course that the United States might pursue under various conditions
                                was from time to time the subject of speculation in the American
                                press but that in so far as I could observe from that source there
                                was nothing approaching a definite crystallization of a common view.
                                Respecting what official attitude my Government might adopt in the
                                specific expectations mentioned I could throw no light
                                whatsoever.</p>

                            <p>Japanese Consul General called on me yesterday. He indicated plainly
                                that the Japanese would immediately and energetically commence <pb
                                    n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0022"/>the task of economic
                                reconstruction. One hundred and fifty leading Japanese
                                industrialists and engineers have already landed to restore public
                                services. The general Japanese community will commence returning
                                about January 20.</p>
                            <p>The Consul General gave the impression that the Japanese, while
                                desiring peace, were puzzled as to how to achieve it. He stated that
                                the Generalissimo was surrounded by Communists who would prevent him

                            <p>The British Ambassador called to see me this morning. He said first
                                that the British Government desired to express their very deep
                                gratitude for the message from the President which I had transmitted
                                to the Ambassador on January 10<note n="34" xml:id="d22fn34">Not

                                he had made of me on January 8. Sir Ronald Lindsay said that the
                                British Government had determined for the time being to postpone
                                making the statement which they had had under consideration that
                                “naval preparations had now been completed” and had determined upon
                                a prior step, namely, further representations to the Japanese
                                Foreign Office through the British Ambassador in Tokyo. The
                                Ambassador then handed me an <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>
                                which summarized the instructions which had been sent by the British
                                Foreign Office to the Ambassador in Tokyo.<note n="35"

                                Ambassador remarked that this was an extremely stiff note and that

                            <p>63. Dr. Tingfu Tsiang [who] recently resigned as Chinese Ambassador
                                in Moscow and will return to China next week via Singapore to become
                                Secretary to the Cabinet called on me this morning and made a number
                                of statements which seemed to me important.</p>
                            <p>He said that he was convinced that the Soviet Union would refuse to
                                enter the Sino-Japanese conflict under any and all conditions. He
                                believed that internal difficulties in the Soviet Union were such at
                                the present time that the Russians would be afraid to attack the
                                Japanese even if the Japanese Army should be greatly weakened by a
                                prolonged Chinese resistance.</p>
                            <p>He said that Litvinov<note n="36" xml:id="d23fn36">Maxim Litvinov,
                                    Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs.</note> had stated to him
                                repeatedly that the Soviet Union would declare war at once on Japan
                                if England, France and the United States should declare war on
                                Japan. He said that he did not <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0024"
                                />believe that this was true and that in his final conversation with
                                Litvinov he had pinned down Litvinov and compelled a reply. He
                                stated that he had asked Litvinov if he meant the Soviet Union would
                                enter war against Japan if any one of the three nations named above
                                should go to war with Japan or only if all three together should go
                                to war with Japan. Litvinov had become completely evasive and
                                finally had made it clear that the Soviet Union had no intention
                                whatsoever of going to war with Japan under any circumstances.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Tsiang stated that on the other hand the Soviet Union was being
                                much more generous in its support of China by munitions and supplies
                                than he had expected. Russia had at first demanded gold from China
                                in payment for supplies, but when the Chinese had insisted that they
                                were unable to pay gold the Russians had agreed to supply them with
                                everything possible on credit. The only payments that the Russians
                                were receiving from China were in the form of antimony and other
                                minerals which the trucks carrying war supplies to China brought
                                back with them on their return journey.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Tsiang stated to me that most of the Russian supplies to China
                                were not going overland but by sea, especially by way of Hong Kong
                                and Canton, although the French railroad from Indo-China was
                                carrying to full capacity.</p>
                            <p>The overland route from Alma Ata in Russian Turkestan to Urumchi in
                                Sinkiang and thence to Lanchow, Sian and Chungking was now a
                                thoroughly passable motor road but it took the best trucks under the
                                best conditions, with no delays or accidents, at least 18 days from
                                the Russian border to Chungking. This made the problem of supplying
                                gasoline almost insuperable and the Chinese had now organized camel
                                caravans to carry supplies of gasoline for the trucks.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Tsiang stated that the whole problem of Chinese resistance was
                                one of obtaining military supplies. He believed that the Soviet
                                Union would continue to furnish all the supplies possible on credit.
                                It was, however, clear that the Japanese might soon blockade the
                                main route of supply by way of Hong Kong, Canton, and Hankow. They
                                might also be able to frighten the French into closing the route of
                                supply by way of French Indo-China. This would leave open only the
                                extremely difficult overland route from Alma Ata to Chungking. It
                                would be impossible to install even a field railway on this route
                                and as a result it might become a matter of life and death for the
                                Chinese to find some other route to supply Chiang Kai Shek’s armies
                                if he should be compelled to repeat [<hi rend="italic"
                                >retreat?</hi>] to Szechuan.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Tsiang stated that there was another excellent route which it
                                might be possible to use: The route by way of Burma. The British
                                railroad from Rangoon to Mandalay and thence to the border of Yunnan
                                had been completed to within 2 miles of the Chinese frontier. <pb
                                    n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0025"/>The road from that point to
                                Yunnanfu was an old one but could be put in order comparatively easy
                                for the transit of modern trucks. Dr. Tsiang stated that he was on
                                his way to London this evening to attempt to make arrangements for
                                the supplying of Chiang Kai Shek’s armies by this route. He stated
                                that the roads from Yunnanfu to Chungking were thoroughly passable.
                                He considered that this route by way of Burma might become China’s
                                life line and hoped that the British Government would do everything

                            <p>In the course of our conversation Dr. Tsiang said that China was
                                still receiving large quantities of military supplies from Germany
                                and Italy and added that the German military mission in China so far
                                as the Chinese could discover was still working loyally and
                                efficiently in assisting Chiang Kai Shek to direct the Chinese
                                armies.</p>

                            <p>14. The Chinese Ambassador called on me today and in the course of
                                conversation brought out the following:</p>
                            <p>Von Neurath<note n="37" xml:id="d25fn37">Baron Constantin H. K. von
                                    Neurath, German Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> had again
                                yesterday assured him of German neutrality. The only feature to his
                                knowledge in which Germany was <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0026"
                                />not entirely neutral lay in the tone of the press which
                                undoubtedly somewhat favored Japan. His Government was “satisfied”
                                however that the German Government was maintaining its neutral
                                position: while Germany was selling arms to Japan it was likewise
                                selling to China and moreover the German Military Mission, despite
                                repeated Japanese protests, remained in China.</p>
                            <p>While one could not tell what “irresponsible” Japanese military
                                elements might do, the Ambassador did not believe that Japan would
                                attack Hong Kong. Even in such a case, however, he did not believe
                                that Great Britain would take any military steps in the Far East
                                until some understandings had been reached with Germany. Thus from a
                                purely Chinese point of view he hoped for a British-German <hi
                                    rend="italic">rapprochement</hi> and was anxious over apparent
                                delays.</p>

                                declare war on Japan at once. I replied that I felt certain that
                                Litvinov had never made such a statement to Norman Davis.</p>
                            <p>I should be obliged if the Department would let me know if Litvinov

                            <p>28. Department’s 10, January 12, 7 p.m. The Imperial Conference was
                                held only for the purpose of giving the Emperor’s sanction to
                                decisions, whatever they were, already formulated and approved by
                                the Government. It ended after a brief session and in the eyes of
                                the Japanese the decisions previously taken are “immutable”.</p>

                                subject would have to be reported to the Cabinet and in the present

                                to modify the decisions of the Imperial Conference as contrasted
                                with the protection of specific American interests would be
                                interpreted at this moment as an effort to interfere with the
                                prerogative of the Emperor and would entail reaction the reverse of

                                <item>The situation which has faced all of us here, whether
                                    representatives of foreign governments or foreign press
                                    correspondents, has been one of extraordinary obscurity. I have
                                    endeavored in my recent telegrams on the Imperial Conference to
                                    indicate trends and to resist the temptation to associate myself
                                    with various theses with regard to what further action might be
                                    taken by Japan such as declaration of war, withdrawal of
                                    recognition of the Chinese Government, et cetera. However, some
                                    of the correspondents, in order to cover themselves and from a
                                    desire to avoid being scooped, have played up the imminent
                                    likelihood of various drastic measures being taken by Japan and
                                    I understand that their despatches have been so recast by news
                                    editors as to give the American public the impression that the
                                    Imperial Conference was called primarily to adopt measures to
                                    prolong, extend and intensify the hostilities. There has been
                                    available no authoritative information with regard to the agenda
                                    and the decision of the conference which would warrant any such

                                    consideration has been given by the Japanese Government to the

                                    occurred and brought about in the highest Japanese quarter a
                                    realization of the danger of involvement with the United States
                                    and Great Britain. The series of discussions between the
                                    Government and Imperial Headquarters which began at about that
                                    time then sought to formulate principles of a basic policy
                                    toward China that might be acceptable to all influential
                                    elements in Japan. Although it was not expected that these
                                    principles would be such as to modify objectives in China there
                                    was reason to believe that the methods to implement these
                                    principles would be such as to reduce to a minimum consistent
                                    with successful conclusion of the hostilities the possibilities
                                    of becoming involved with the United States and Great Britain.
                                    It now appears that the question of resorting to a declaration
                                    of war was at that time thoroughly discussed and was then tabled
                                    until dragged out again by Suyetsugu at the Cabinet meeting on

                                        policy, Ambassador Grew, in despatch No. 2746, January 22,
                                        stressed the importance of civilian leaders checking
                                        military action which tended toward war, not only with China
                                        and the United Kingdom, but also with the United States.
                                        “This trend toward declaring war passed,” he concluded. “The
                                        change would appear to have been brought about through a
                                        disposition on the part of the Throne to avert suck risks.”

                                <item>The conferences between the Government and Imperial
                                    Headquarters were progressing toward a final conference in the
                                    presence of the Emperor at which time the principles of a basic
                                    policy toward China were to be adopted when the Germans offered
                                    to act as a channel of communications between the Chinese and
                                    Japanese Governments. This move by the Germans was entirely
                                    fortuitous and was not a link in the chain of events which led
                                    to the conference on January 12. That conference would have
                                    taken place in any event as soon as the necessary agreement of
                                    views between the Government and Imperial Headquarters was

                                    hostilities. The basis of peace which was adopted will determine

                                <item>It is in the field of future developments that the principles
                                    of policy decided upon by the conference, whatever they may be,
                                    offer grounds for apprehension. We believe that the primary
                                    principle is that China shall cooperate with Japan to combat
                                    communism; but we take it that this does not mean any
                                    association of China with Japan to combat the mere propagation
                                    of a doctrine but that it will entail some form of political and
                                    military coordination between the two countries which will
                                    permit Japan to eliminate China as a hostile factor in the event
                                    of a war between Japan and Russia. If the reply which is shortly
                                    expected of the Chinese Government should be—as is probable—such
                                    as to eliminate any chance of a peace conformable to the
                                    principles of Japan’s basic policy and if China should manifest
                                    beyond all possibility of doubt its determination to continue
                                    the struggle the way has now been left open for the Japanese
                                    Government, in the exercise of its prerogatives, to consider
                                    whether it should not withdraw its recognition of the Chinese
                                    Government and to support and perhaps eventually grant <hi

                                how far the United States would be willing to go in coercive action
                                and after having been told by Mr. Davis that we were not considering

                                would want to feel certain that she would not be left with the bag

                            <p>33. Tokyo’s 23, January 12, 2 [<hi rend="italic">11</hi>] p.m., and
                                25, January 13, 6 p.m. If the Japanese are in earnest in wishing an
                                early termination of hostilities, I am disposed to believe, without
                                having any tangible evidence to support the belief, and in the
                                knowledge that it may be too optimistic, that they will probably
                                propose, and insist upon, a 5-provinee autonomous, or
                                semi-autonomous, government in North China, fashioned on the plan of
                                the present Provisional Government, as the minimum basis of
                                negotiations, plus some arrangement for a demilitarized zone within
                                a radius of 20 or 30 miles of Shanghai, plus an indemnity for
                                property losses and an agreement regarding the suppression of
                                communism. An area composed of Shansi, Chahar, Suiyuan, Hopei and
                                Shantung would be about all that Japan, in addition to Manchukuo,
                                could at this time safely undertake to control and even that would
                                be likely to tax the resourcefulness of the Japanese selected to
                                guide its destiny. Certainly the Japanese in Peiping are not finding
                                it easy to discover the right type of Chinese willing to assume
                                responsible positions in the government. To undertake such a task in
                                wide areas in the Yangtze Valley and in the South, which areas are
                                less responsive to control than the North, would be an undertaking
                                from which they might well shrink. The reestablishment of a
                                government at Nanking, with or without Chiang Kai Shek at its head,
                                and one which would undertake to keep the peace with Japan, would
                                seem to be within the realm of possibilities, if the Japanese desire
                                for peace envisages moderation and some sense of the national pride
                                and the rights of the Chinese. The Japanese would probably be
                                reluctant permanently to occupy provinces south of Hopei and
                                Shantung unless all hope of coming to terms with Chiang Kai Shek
                                must be given up, in which case all of Kiangsu and Anhui, and
                                perhaps even Honan and Hupeh, would come under Japanese domination.
                                The persistent resistance of the Chinese and the prospect of a
                                continuance of that attitude, coupled with what is believed <pb
                                    n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0031"/>to be differences of opinion
                                among the Japanese military with regard to political aspects of the
                                situation in China, are calculated to make it impossible for the
                                Japanese to dictate terms which would embrace all that they would
                                wish to exact from China as compensation for Japan’s unexpectedly
                                large losses and the tremendous expense of the campaign.</p>
                            <p>As harsh as the possible basic terms suggested above may seem, it is
                                doubtful whether the Chinese could obtain more favorable ones 3 or 6
                                months hence or even a year hence. I say this because I believe,
                                without any tangible evidence to support the belief, that the
                                Japanese are in a position financially, economically, and
                                militarily, to continue the conflict as a cohesive military
                                organization for a much longer time than can the Chinese, and
                                because I do not feel that there is a likelihood of changes taking
                                place in the near future in Japan, or of the intervention of any
                                third power, which would make it impossible for Japan to continue to
                                prosecute the war. Unless both sides can be brought to realization
                                of the urgent need for an early and just conclusion of the conflict,
                                the war will go on to add to the misery of many more millions of
                                Chinese and to even more widespread economic dislocation, to say
                                nothing of the tremendous loss of life and property which will
                                ensue—and perhaps to no benefit—and ultimately lead to more serious
                                disorder in the Far East and further international complications, a
                                situation which might well add also to the confusion in other parts
                                of the world.</p>

                                Government and Imperial Headquarters a draft statement on Japan’s
                                policy toward China to be issued shortly by the Government was
                                examined. According to unconfirmed reports the draft was

                            <p>Mr. Suma called by appointment at his own request and inquired
                                whether there were any new developments in the Alaska fisheries
                                question. I said that the matter was still being considered by this
                                Government and that no instructions had yet been sent to our Embassy
                                at Tokyo. Mr. Suma asked whether it was expected that a decision on
                                this matter would be reached next week. I said that I hoped it would
                                be but that I could give him no definite assurances of this.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Suma stated that it had been reported to the Embassy that on
                                January 4 a Chinese plane had been shot down on which they found the
                                body of an American aviator who was buried in the international
                                burying ground on January 8, 1938, and that the name of this aviator
                                was Frank Kruezberg. Mr. Suma did not know the spelling of the name
                                but this was as near as he could approximate it from the Japanese
                                letters. (Note: Hankow telegraphed on January 7 that Frederick
                                Kruezberg’s body was brought to Hankow for interment in
                                International Cemetery, Hankow, that information from Chinese
                                aviation circles was that he was killed in an air crash on January 4
                                about twelve miles from Hankow.) He said that service by American
                                aviators in Chinese air forces was likely to cause anti-American
                                feeling in Japan. I told him that we could not prevent Americans
                                from taking service with foreign military forces, and that we are
                                discouraging such activities by Americans by placing on passports
                                the statement that the passports are not valid for travel to foreign
                                countries for the purpose of entering the military service of
                                foreign governments. Mr. Suma said that some months ago he had
                                spoken to Mr. Hornbeck<note n="44" xml:id="d32fn44">Stanley K.

                                matter; that Mr. Hornbeck had said that the matter (the reported

                                Government) was one for our judicial authorities, and that his
                                Government appreciated our attitude but that he merely brought this
                                matter to our attention.</p>
                            <p>At this point I was obliged to leave and Mr. Ballantine continued the
                                conversation with Mr. Suma. Mr. Suma dwelt at some length upon the
                                friendly feelings toward the United States which had been developed
                                by our restrained attitude in regard to the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Panay</hi> incident, and upon the shock which this incident had
                                caused Japan. With this introduction he brought up, as off the
                                record, the matter of the visit of our three cruisers to Singapore
                                and said that as the Japanese Navy had not been invited to
                                participate in the opening of the naval base at Singapore, or any
                                other navy except the American, this matter was arousing
                                considerable notice in Japan. He also referred to reports regarding
                                a joint Anglo-American naval demonstration. Mr. Ballantine made no
                                comment other than to say that so far as we were concerned, the
                                visit of our vessels to Singapore was a normal matter, we having
                                received an invitation which we had accepted.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Ballantine then inquired of Mr. Suma what the general prospects
                                in the Far Eastern situation were and Mr. Suma said that as the
                                Chinese Government had not accepted the peace terms which had been
                                presented to Chiang Kai-shek by the German Ambassador, he believed
                                that the hostilities would continue. He said that the Japanese terms
                                were, of course, quite vague but that they were in general in line
                                with the cardinal policies which Japan had sought to carry out even
                                before the outbreak of hostilities. He added that, of course, the
                                condition regarding indemnities was new. He thought Chiang Kai-shek,
                                owing to his previous declarations, would find it difficult to
                                accept such terms without losing face. Mr. Suma expressed in a
                                round-about way the view that Chiang might be willing to negotiate
                                on the basis of such terms if he could indicate that he had been
                                advised to do so by some strong and friendly power such as the
                                United States. Mr. Suma asked Mr. Ballantine, off the record, what
                                his reaction would be to the United States assuming such a role. Mr.
                                Ballantine said that in his personal opinion our Government would be
                                unwilling to assume such a role.</p>

                            <p>32. My German colleague was this morning informed by the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs that the Japanese Government declines to <pb n="30"
                                    xml:id="pg_30" facs="0034"/>accede to the request of the Chinese
                                Government for further definition and elucidation of its proposed
                                peace terms and that the peace overtures are therefore finished. The
                                German Embassy informs me that the tentative peace exchanges have
                                been going on for some time and that this final break is due to the
                                unwillingness of the Japanese to commit themselves further by making
                                more specific their terms, particularly their military terms, as
                                requested by the Chinese Government.</p>
                            <p>As a result of this rupture of the tentative peace exchanges the
                                Japanese Government at noon today issued the following statement.

                            <p>35. At the end of my conversation this morning with the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs he said that he would like to explain to me the
                                background of the announcement made by the Japanese Government
                                yesterday (Embassy’s 32, January 16, 3 p.m.). He said that through
                                the good offices of the German Ambassador certain peace proposals
                                were made to the Chinese Government in December and that an answer
                                was expected during the early part of January. On January 14th the
                                Chinese Government returned a “perfunctory” reply merely asking for
                                further information concerning the proposed terms. The Japanese
                                Government then became convinced of the futility of further
                                negotiations and decided to have no further dealings with the
                                Government now located in Hankow. The Minister said that this did
                                not involve a specific act effecting a breach of diplomatic
                                relations but simply meant a cessation of dealing with Hankow on the
                                ground that the government in Hankow no longer represents China. The
                                Minister said that there would be no immediate recognition of any
                                regime but that the Japanese Government would await development. The
                                regime in North China would constitute the “basic power” of whatever
                                government should eventually ibe recognized and that that government
                                would include such regimes as were friendly to Japan. It was not
                                possible as yet to foresee whether such a regime would develop in
                                Nanking.</p>

                                diplomatic officers, and that in the ordinary course of business
                                there is perhaps more necessity for consular officers to have
                                contact with officials of Provisional Government than for members of
                                the staff of the Embassy. Please clarify the point raised by

                                of these two cities and probably to reduce the number at Shanghai
                                down to the level existing before the Japanese invasion; that the
                                question arises as to just how and when the evacuation of these
                                guards and troops can and should be made to avoid the appearance of
                                scuttling on the one hand and at <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32"
                                    facs="0036"/>the same time possibly to permit synchronization
                                with any naval movements which might occur on the part of our two
                                countries. I expressed a desire that the Ambassador, in any event,
                                should ascertain from his Government all phases of its views and
                                suggestions by which these evacuations could take place somewhat in
                                accordance with the views of the different governments interested,
                                after consultation with each other. I said that the question of
                                removing embassies from Peiping is one in which we raise the
                                suggestion as to whether the American Embassy, for instance, should
                                not be retained although closed, with most of the embassy personnel
                                and some of the movable property taken away; and a Consul General
                                retained at Tientsin; that the guards left at Peiping would make
                                possible the continued operation of the radio station; that we had
                                considered withdrawing a portion of our guards and troops at first
                                but having in mind the possibility of withdrawing the remainder at
                                any time circumstances might suggest; that in the event Japan should
                                install a puppet government in North China we could upon the
                                announcement of such, however, withdraw our embassy establishment at
                                Peiping, leaving possibly a chargé, etcetera.</p>

                                over the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo and representing China’s interests
                                there after the contemplated departure within another day or two of
                                the Chinese Ambassador from Tokyo.</p>
                            <p>I requested the Ambassador to state just what his proposal was,
                                although I had talked the matter over somewhat with Mr. Wilson
                                several days ago. The Ambassador replied that in the event of the
                                contemplated departure of the Chinese Ambassador from Tokyo this
                                week he would like to renew his request, made to Mr. Hugh Wilson,
                                that this Government take charge of China’s interests there. He then
                                added that Mr. Wilson brought up a question to the effect that if
                                Japan should organize a puppet government in North China and should
                                authorize representatives of that puppet government to take charge
                                of the Chinese Embassy and its properties and files at Tokyo, the
                                Government of the United States might have an embarrassing <pb
                                    n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0037"/>situation presented to it
                                with respect to whether it would or would not surrender its
                                possession of the Chinese interests and properties, I referred more
                                in detail to this situation and emphasized the view that since the
                                Japanese are apparently in the act of establishing a puppet
                                government in North China, if they have not already done so, the
                                question of turning over possession of the Chinese Embassy and its
                                properties at Tokyo might be brought up right away. I then inquired
                                of the Ambassador what he would do in those circumstances if he were
                                in our place. He was a little reserved but expressed the view that
                                he knew we would not like to turn over properties to such puppet
                                government agencies. I explained that that was not conclusive,
                                however, of the question presented. He had no further comment,
                                except that they would be desirous of calling on us to take charge
                                of China’s interests at Tokyo. I said to him that naturally this
                                Government is always desirous of rendering any reasonable and
                                practical service to his Government; that it would be necessary, in
                                my opinion, for me to investigate this question which might possibly
                                arise, and I would undertake to do so and notify him of any new or
                                further impressions I might have as soon as was practicable.</p>

                            <p>It is the intention of the British Government to withdraw one British
                                battalion from Shanghai at the end of January and the British
                                military authorities there consider that the two remaining
                                battalions will be enough to man those portions of the defense
                                perimeter allotted to the British.</p>
                            <p>The British Government understands that the U. S. Marines of
                                emergency reenforcements are likely to leave on or about the 15th of
                                February. The British Government would be glad to know whether the
                                United States Government have any objection to their not replacing
                                the one British battalion which is to be withdrawn and what are the
                                intentions of the United States Government as regards the reduction
                                of their own military forces at Shanghai.</p>

                            <p>The American Government has for some time had in contemplation
                                possible withdrawal from Shanghai of the regiment of marines sent
                                    <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0038"/>to Shanghai as
                                reenforcements last fall. The American Government has already
                                informed the British Government of this. The American Government
                                perceives no reason why the contemplated withdrawal by the British
                                Government of one battalion of the British landed armed force, at
                                about the end of January, should not be carried out. The withdrawal
                                of the American regiment would probably take place before the middle
                                of February. According to our understanding, if and when these
                                contemplated withdrawals are effected, there would remain of the
                                British force at Shanghai two battalions; and there would remain of
                                the American force one regiment.</p>

                            <p>Several weeks ago the British Government suggested the possible
                                desirability of withdrawing the Embassy establishments and the Boxer
                                Protocol forces from north China and asked for this Government’s
                                opinion. Reply was made that in our opinion a withdrawal at that
                                time would be premature. The British Government later informed us
                                that it had conferred with the French Government, that the French
                                Government shared substantially the opinion expressed by the
                                American Government, and that the British Government had decided to
                                let the matter rest.</p>
                            <p>The American Government has kept this question in mind and now
                                believes that action toward making withdrawals would be advisable.
                                It is our understanding that the British Government leans toward
                                that view.</p>
                            <p>It is our opinion that withdrawals, if and as made, should be made in
                                such manner as to avoid giving any impression of a political
                                retreat, to cause a minimum of psychological disturbance, to afford
                                a maximum of service of the objectives for which these
                                establishments have existed, and to synchronize with possible other
                                steps and developments.</p>
                            <p>We feel that most of the armed forces might in the near future be
                                withdrawn; that the consulates general at Tientsin should remain;
                                that small armed guards might be maintained at Tientsin and at
                                Peiping; that at some given moment the Embassy establishments might

                                        Government has repeatedly declared its readiness to seek an
                                        amicable settlement by any of the pacific means known to
                                        international law. But Japan regardless of all consequences
                                        embarked upon a large scale invasion of China and a wanton
                                        massacre of her people by land, naval and air forces. China
                                        was thus forced to act in self defence against violence and
                                        aggression.</p>
                                    <p>During the last few months a large number of Chinese cities
                                        and towns have been illegally occupied by the Japanese Army
                                        whereas not a single Chinese soldier has set foot on
                                        Japanese territory. Lives and property have been ruthlessly
                                        destroyed by the invaders. Soldiers who had given up arms
                                        and helpless noncombatants including women and children were
                                        murdered in cold blood while untold damage was done to
                                        industrial and cultural enterprises.</p>

                                        and the Nine Power Treaty has in unmistakable terms been
                                        pronounced by the nations of the world. The responsibility
                                        for disturbing international peace clearly rests with Japan
                                        and not with China.</p>
                                    <p>In spite of such well known facts Japan has now declared that
                                        she respects the territory and sovereign rights of China as
                                        well as the rights and interests of foreign powers in this
                                        country. It should be observed, however, that by respect for
                                        China’s territory and sovereignty Japan means the
                                        dismembering of China through the creation by force of
                                        various unlawful organizations within Chinese territory and
                                        the making use of such organizations to usurp the sovereign
                                        rights of China. Likewise by respect for the rights and
                                        interests of foreign powers Japan means the securing of
                                        monopolistic rights through her predominant position in
                                        China.</p>
                                    <p>The object of China’s armed resistance is to safeguard her
                                        national existence and to maintain the sanctity of
                                        international treaties. Though her desire for peace remains
                                        unchanged, China cannot tolerate any encroachment by any
                                        foreign country upon her sovereign rights and territorial
                                        and administrative integrity which are the essential
                                        attributes of her independent status and which all
                                        interested powers by a solemn treaty have pledged themselves
                                        to respect.</p>
                                    <p>Under whatever circumstances the Chinese Government will
                                        exert its utmost to maintain the sovereign rights and
                                        territorial and administrative integrity of China. Any terms
                                        for the restoration of peace, if they do not conform to this
                                        fundamental principle, are necessarily unacceptable to
                                        China.</p>

                                        conflict in China is of concern not only to the two
                                        countries most directly involved but to the whole world.
                                        Both the people and the Government of the United States view
                                        with anxious solicitude and profound regret the destruction
                                        which is being wrought. The cause of peace is one which we
                                        have very much at heart. We are giving constant study and
                                        thought to the problem of ways and means which may
                                        contribute most effectively toward promoting peace and
                                        facilitating international cooperation. Our efforts toward
                                        those ends will not be relaxed. It is our earnest hope that
                                        out of the present conflict in the Far East, and in place of
                                        it, there will come a settlement which, by virtue of
                                        reasonable provisions adequately considerate of the rights,
                                        legitimate interests and national integrity of all
                                        concerned, will provide a basis for amicable relationships
                                        and an enduring peace. Very sincerely yours, Franklin D.
                                        Roosevelt.”</p>

                            <p>39. My British colleague has given me for my confidential information
                                a paraphrase of a telegram dated January 15, from the British
                                Embassy at Shanghai reporting actions of Japanese troops at Nanking.
                                As we have had no detailed reports on this subject from Shanghai or
                                elsewhere I am cabling the text which was furnished to me as
                                follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“I have been supplied confidentially with two separate and
                                        completely reliable reports, from an American missionary at
                                        Nanking and a missionary doctor at Wuhu who remained at
                                        their posts when the Japanese entered these cities,
                                        regarding the atrocities committed by the Japanese Army.
                                        Reports quote approximately 100 authenticated cases of rape
                                        in the American University Buildings in Nanking in the first
                                        few days of the occupation.</p>
                                    <p>The Reverend Boynton of the National Christian Council who
                                        brought me these reports stated that the Japanese Embassy
                                        officials who reached Nanking shortly after the entry of the
                                        Japanese troops were horrified when they saw the orgy of
                                        drunkenness, murder, rape and robbery, which was going on
                                        openly in and around the refugee zone. Failing to make any
                                        impression on the military commander, whose attitude of
                                        callous indifference makes it probable that the army was
                                        deliberately turned loose on the cit yas a punitive measure,

                                        Embassy officials had even suggested to the missionaries
                                        that the latter should try and get publicity for the facts
                                        in Japan so that the Japanese Government would be forced by
                                        public opinion to curb the army.</p>

                            <p>The representative of His Majesty’s Embassy at Peking was faced some
                                days ago with the question whether to receive a visit from the Mayor
                                of Tientsin who has been newly appointed by the Provisional
                                Government. In the end His Majesty’s Consul and the Chinese
                                Secretary received the Mayor at the former’s house. A similar
                                procedure was followed by the French representatives but it is
                                understood that the United States Counsellor received the Mayor on a
                                “personal basis” on general authority from the United States
                                Government “to receive and return calls of officials of the present
                                régime provided this was done in a personal manner”.</p>
                            <p>His Majesty’s Embassy have now asked for authority to follow in
                                future a similar procedure to that of the United States Embassy, and
                                His Majesty’s Government agree that the closer the procedures of the
                                two Embassies can conform the better. They would therefore be
                                grateful if they might receive as early information as possible as
                                to what precise procedure the United States Government would
                                prescribe for the treatment by their diplomatic representatives, so
                                long as these remain within the territory of the Provisional
                                Government, both of actual members of the Provisional Government and
                                of territorial officials such as the Mayor of Tientsin. On receipt
                                of this information instructions will be issued to His Majesty’s
                                Representatives to ensure as far as possible the adoption of a
                                common attitude.</p>

                            <p>The British Ambassador called at my request. I said to him that, as
                                he was aware, the situation in the Far East was becoming
                                increasingly <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0043"/>dangerous and
                                desperate, calling for the closest observation and analysis and the
                                most careful planning; that these conditions in the Pacific area
                                were closely tied in, especially with the German and Italian
                                situation in Europe; that any improvement in the European situation
                                would correspondingly affect the Far Eastern situation; that
                                naturally we here feel the vital importance of the closest possible
                                observation of every fact, circumstance and development which might
                                be useful and important, especially to countries like Great Britain
                                and the United States in dealing with the situation to the best
                                advantage and without the risk of unfortunate delay.</p>
                            <p>I then asked the Ambassador a number of confidential questions not
                                for the record. The Ambassador concurred in the observations I
                                offered and indicated a disposition to collaborate and cooperate at
                                all times to the fullest extent. He did not know anything about any
                                plans of his Government with respect to the removal of their troops
                                out of China or any movements of their Navy.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador thought that the bad economic and other domestic
                                repercussions in Rumania, following the change of government, might
                                mean an early solution of acute conditions. He thought there was no
                                danger whatever in any dissolution or weakening of the
                                Franco-Russian Alliance. I urged his Government to give every
                                consistent attention to the question of how the reciprocal trade
                                program and the kindred policies such as further exchange
                                stabilization and others might be carried forward by any possible
                                means, including definite steps to loosen up exchange conditions
                                here and there and otherwise to urge and encourage other nations to
                                proceed to take an affirmative interest in this general movement
                                which has for its chief purpose peace by economic appeasement. He
                                agreed to this view and added that he would be glad to keep in touch
                                with his Government in this connection. I further remarked that, if
                                and when he or his Government had any special or important facts
                                pertaining to Germany or Italy in particular in relation to the
                                proposed program which our two Governments are sponsoring, including
                                that of general rehabilitation in Europe, we here would be most
                                interested to have the benefit of them. He said he would be glad to
                                bring this matter to the attention of his Government.</p>

                            <p>22. With reference to a report from Tokyo that the Japanese
                                Government had thanked Germany for its attempt at an adjustment in
                                the <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0044"/>Far Eastern conflict, the
                                Deutsches Nachrichten Buro last evening carried the following
                                announcement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“It is learned from official quarters that in the course of
                                        conversations which took place at the end of October 1937
                                        between the German Ambassadors in Nanking and Tokyo and the
                                        Governments there, the wish was expressed by the Governments
                                        of the two countries in conflict for the assistance of
                                        Germany in the attempt to find an adjustment. In order to
                                        serve the interests of peace in the reestablishment of which
                                        Germany is as interested as the rest of the world, the
                                        German Government believed it should place itself at the
                                        disposal of the two countries with which it was on friendly
                                        terms for the proposed purpose. Hereby Germany from the
                                        beginning stressed that its attitude in the conflict was
                                        neutral and that therefore its cooperation could not
                                        transcend the simple transmission of communications which
                                        one of the two Governments might wish to transmit to the
                                        other. This principle has been observed.</p>
                                    <p>“With the publication on January 16 of the manifesto of the
                                        Japanese Government the conflict between Japan and China has
                                        entered a new stage”.</p>

                                countries had so far shown very little understanding for Japan’s
                                action, that they had not like Germany observed a neutral attitude
                                and that the proposed <hi rend="italic">démarche</hi> is apparently
                                primarily to be directed against Japan. It is intimated finally that
                                the step would probably be of little use in view of the Japanese
                                manifesto on January 16.</p>
                            <p>I inquired as to the basis of this announcement of Bismarck<note

                                    German Foreign Office.</note> at the Foreign Office this morning
                                who informed me in substance as follows. The German Ambassadors at
                                Nanking and Tokyo had facilitated the transmissions of two series of
                                communications between the Chinese and Japanese Governments, one of
                                which commencing in October last had extended into November and the
                                other beginning at the end of December had continued for a time in
                                January. Germany had not, however, acted in any capacity other than
                                as a forwarding agent and had added nothing whatsoever to the
                                communications except to express the wish to both parties that a
                                settlement might be achieved. Germany had undertaken this in
                                response to the request of the parties both of which had expressed
                                the view that Germany afforded a suitable agency inasmuch as she was
                                the only great power which through the Brussels Conference<note

                                position in the matter. Both parties had requested at the time that
                                    <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0045"/>Germany not make her
                                action public. He was aware that this had been the cause of
                                “misunderstandings” in the press (Department’s 115, November 5, 1
                                    p.m.<note n="59" xml:id="d47fn59">Not printed.</note>) and that
                                Germany was thus pleased that on the initiative of Japan the matter
                                was being cleared up. The fact that the announcement came at this
                                time had no special meaning except that Germany’s action having come
                                to an end rendered it opportune.</p>
                            <p>Respecting the general situation in the Far East, Bismarck expressed
                                the view that the breaking of relations between Japan and China
                                would not affect the status of affairs unless Japan should declare
                                war. He believed that the conflict had now entered on a phase which
                                meant that it would be long protracted. He could see no hope for
                                success of mediatory efforts at this time.</p>
                            <p>He said that Germany was maintaining her attitude of complete
                                neutrality and had informed the Chinese Government that it intended
                                to continue that course unless Russia should enter the conflict in
                                which case Germany would have to reconsider her position. He said,
                                however, that the Foreign Office did not perceive any indication of
                                Russia’s taking such a step.</p>
                            <p>Regarding the item in the <hi rend="italic">Temps</hi> cited above,
                                Bismarck said that he was not aware of its having any official

                            <p>Authorities have issued manifestoes: Exhorting popular support of

                                organization and political activities within framework of Sun’s
                                doctrine; encouraging populace in hitherto forbidden private
                                possession of arms (said to include 400,000 rifles) and their
                                dedication to patriotic usage.</p>
                            <p>Movement has been boosted by tremendous press publicity and by
                                officially encouraged student activity in leading popular
                                demonstrations and organizing young men’s militant associations and
                                propaganda campaigns, and authorities have decreed that certain
                                students be sent to popularize it throughout interior. Revolutionary
                                aspect of movement is being capitalized to encourage its backing by
                                labor groups.</p>
                            <p>Several hundred thousand new rifles reliably reported being
                                distributed to interior farmers.</p>
                            <p>A commission including highest military, civil and party authorities
                                has been appointed to supervise program, active direction to be
                                entrusted to nine regional leaders apparently responsible for all
                                measures, militia organization, training, coordination of volunteer
                                self-defense corps and emergency defense of their regions in
                                cooperation with regular army. These leaders thus far announced are

                                enthusiasts reportedly including Chen Ming Shu, Tsai Ting Kai and Li

                            <p>While program is not yet in full operation it is reported reliably
                                that organized armed militia under training already number about
                                200,000 with several hundred thousand more enrolled.</p>
                            <p>Definitely Leftist in appearance, the movement emphasizes special
                                concern for popular, especially farm labor, welfare and apparently
                                supports closer relations with Russia and democratic countries and
                                the policy of destruction of Japanese and surrendered Chinese
                                properties.</p>
                            <p>Identic coordinated movements are reported in Kwangsi and Hunan
                                though the program is less significant in Kwangsi due to the
                                province’s already highly developed militia and police training
                                systems.</p>
                            <p>While it is too early to estimate the movement’s full significance
                                and possible consequences, there appears no doubt of its present

                                <item>The headquarters of the Japanese forces in North China have
                                    been transferred from Tientsin to Peiping. General Terauchi
                                    arrived yesterday, stating that the primary reason for the
                                    transfer is military, that he may be able to render personal
                                    assistance to the new Government and to cooperate in the
                                    execution of administrative policies, that due to the absence of
                                    sincerity on the part of the National Government, the Japanese
                                    Government has been compelled to take steps to cease dealing
                                    with the National Government, and that his entire efforts will
                                    be directed toward complete extermination of the Kuomintang Army
                                    and the construction and consolidation of “the new and rising
                                    China”.</item>

                                <item>The transfer of the headquarters has been under consideration
                                    for some time. Presumably the delay in transfer was due to a
                                    decision not to take a step which might create an additional
                                    hindrance to Sino-Japanese negotiations, a reason which however
                                    ceased to exist with Japan’s decision not to deal without [<hi
                                        rend="italic">with the?</hi>] National Government. The
                                    primary reason for the transfer seems to be, as Terauchi said,
                                    military, as Peiping is from the viewpoint of strategic
                                    communications more important than Tientsin. The new Chinese
                                    regime can scarcely welcome the change as its puppet character
                                    will thus be emphasized. Japanese claim that the transfer is not
                                    related to Japanese dissatisfaction with Wang Keh Min.<note

                            <p>Mr. Matsukata appropriately acknowledged this friendly overture,
                                remarked that Mr. Welles had mentioned meeting his father during the
                                World War, and made the observation that he, Matsukata, had now come
                                here at a time when Japan was “at war.” He then referred to some
                                features of the present situation and led up to and made an inquiry
                                whether the American Government might not tender to Japan and China
                                the good offices of this country. He developed his statement and
                                inquiry in a manner which implied or warranted <pb n="45"
                                    xml:id="pg_45" facs="0049"/>inference that he felt that the
                                existing situation is one of disadvantage and hazard to Japan, and
                                he stressed the possibility of its leading to serious controversy or
                                conflict between Japan and other countries, with the implication
                                that it therefore makes the position of other countries
                                hazardous.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Welles said that he wished to be perfectly frank and wished to
                                make the attitude and position of this Government clear beyond the
                                possibility of any misunderstanding. He would ask Mr. Hornbeck to
                                state on what occasions this Government had already proffered its
                                good offices. Mr. Hornbeck said that, on July 12, five days after

                                willing, toward composing their differences; that the Secretary had
                                said the same thing to the Chinese Ambassador at that time; and
                                that, thereafter, on the occasion of almost every interview which he
                                had had with the Japanese and the Chinese Ambassadors respectively,
                                the Secretary had reiterated those points. Mr. Welles raised

                                Conference, and Mr. Hornbeck went on to say that at the Brussels
                                Conference this Government and the other Conference powers, taking
                                note of the Japanese Government’s reply to the Belgian Government’s
                                invitation in terms indicating that the Japanese Government was not
                                prepared to attend the Conference, had suggested to and requested of
                                the Japanese Government that that Government appoint a
                                representative to confer with representatives of a few or a small
                                number of the powers; and that the Japanese Government had replied
                                that it was not prepared to do that.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Welles then referred to Mr. Matsukata’s inquiry and stated that
                                he, Mr. Welles, having lived three years in Japan, had long had a
                                most friendly feeling toward the Japanese people and a great
                                admiration of their many splendid qualities and outstanding
                                achievements; that he shared Mr. Matsukata’s view that the present
                                situation is deplorable and fraught with hazards; that the
                                Government of the United States has from the outset been desirous of
                                contributing toward ameliorating the situation in the Far East and
                                toward composing the conflict which is going on there. We have
                                repeatedly proferred our good offices. The Japanese Government has
                                at no time responded favorably. It is our understanding that the
                                German Government a few weeks ago took steps toward mediation, that
                                the Japanese <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0050"/>Government
                                informed the German Ambassador in China of the Japanese Government’s
                                peace proposals, that the German Ambassador laid these before the
                                Chinese Government, and that the Chinese Government did not find the
                                proposals acceptable. The American Government could not take at this
                                time an initiative; it could act only if it were informed officially
                                by the Japanese Government and by the Chinese Government
                                respectively that those Governments desire an exercise of good
                                offices by it; and that, if we were to embark upon exercise of good
                                offices, our action would have to be on the basis of terms
                                consistent with the Nine Power Treaty.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Matsukata appeared disconcerted. He said that if the American
                                Government felt that it must fall back on “historical” ground and
                                insist on applying the Nine Power Treaty the whole problem was made
                                very difficult.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Welles commented on that statement, to the effect that the
                                American Government did not regard the Nine Power Treaty as being
                                merely an “historical” instrument; that this Government regards that
                                treaty as an agreement still in effect between and among the powers
                                parties to it, among which are both Japan and the United States, and
                                that, as we have on several occasions stated, such an agreement is
                                binding until it has been made not so by the common assent of the
                                parties to it, a procedure quite different from a unilateral
                                disregard of it by some one of the parties. Mr. Welles asked whether
                                Mr. Hornbeck would care to make any comment.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hornbeck referred to the fact that in 1933 or 1934 this
                                Government, in a communication to the Japanese Government through
                                Mr. Grew,<note n="66" xml:id="d51fn66">See Department’s telegram No.

                                    231</ref>.</note> had expressly and formally stated that in our
                                view the provisions of treaties can be altered, but only by
                                recognized processes. He continued, with the raising of an
                                hypothetical question: Suppose that the question of the Nine Power
                                Treaty could be left out of consideration, suppose there were no
                                such treaty; could Mr. Matsukata expect the American Government, in
                                view of the facts that the Germans have been endeavoring to bring
                                about a mediation and that Japan’s terms have been communicated to
                                the Chinese and that those terms are what they are and that the
                                Chinese have rejected them,—could the American Government at this
                                moment step in and proffer its good offices? Mr. Matsukata replied
                                that the United States was very different from Germany; that the
                                Japanese had confidence in the United States; that the United States
                                is a great and powerful and friendly power; and that he thought that
                                a proffer on our part would be listened to. He said that the
                                Japanese felt kindly toward the United States but were now not well
                                disposed toward Great Britain; that Americans treated the Japanese
                                with an attitude of understanding <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47"
                                    facs="0051"/>and consideration but that the British did not;
                                that the Japanese would be receptive toward any efforts which the
                                United States might make in the direction of and in connection with
                                mediation; but that if the British were included in the making of
                                such an effort the Japanese would react unfavorably.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Welles said that he wanted to make one point perfectly clear;
                                that Mr. Matsukata must not infer from what Mr. Hornbeck had said
                                that the facts of the existence of the Nine Power Treaty and of
                                matters appertaining thereto could be set aside or left out of
                                consideration. He pointed out that Mr. Hornbeck simply asked a
                                hypothetical question. Mr. Hornbeck said that he too felt it
                                important that Mr. Matsukata should not infer from what he had said
                                that the Nine Power Treaty could be left out of consideration.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Matsukata again indicated that he felt that this view on the part
                                of the American Government made the question of bringing the
                                hostilities to an end very difficult; and he made a plea for our
                                sweeping all such considerations aside and concentrating entirely on
                                the fact that there exists in the Far East a tragic situation
                                potential of producing even worse situations. He again urged that
                                the United States should take an initiative.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Welles stated that our position was as follows:</p>
                            <p>First, That action in the direction of mediation could be taken by
                                this Government only if there came to it an official indication from
                                the Japanese Government and a similar indication from the Chinese
                                Government that good offices or mediation by this Government are
                                desired by those Governments respectively; Second, That this
                                Government could act only on the basis of and in the light of its
                                being understood that the settlement must be consistent with both
                                the principles and the provisions of the Nine Power Treaty; and
                                Third, That it is the position of this Government that the
                                provisions of the Nine Power Treaty are susceptible of modification,
                                amendment and alteration, but only by recognized processes of
                                negotiation and agreement, not by unilateral action on the part of
                                any one power.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Matsukata arose to take leave. He thanked Mr. Welles for having
                                received him and given him so much time. Mr. Welles again expressed
                                his admiration of Mr. Matsukata’s father and his pleasure at having
                                met Mr. Matsukata. Mr. Matsukata, in saying good-bye to Mr.
                                Hornbeck, remarked, “Do not be too hard on us.” Mr. Hornbeck,
                                surprised at this remark, replied that none of us has any desire to
                                be “hard on” Japan; that we are animated by no feeling of hostility;
                                and that we are all intent on and hopeful of doing something
                                constructively helpful in our relations with countries of the Far
                                East. Mr. Matsukata said, “In that case it will be all right.”</p>
                            <p>The interview there ended.</p>

                                <item>At an early point in this conversation Mr. Welles took
                                    occasion to speak of the adverse effect on public opinion in
                                    this country which had been produced by the <hi rend="italic"

                                <item>At a late point in the conversation Mr. Matsukata asked
                                    expressly whether Mr. Welles had been informed by Mr. Grew of
                                    Japan’s peace proposals. Mr. Welles said that he had been
                                    informed. Mr. Matsukata asked whether the American Government
                                    could not look with approval upon those proposals. Mr. Welles
                                    said that before it would be possible for him to come to any
                                    conclusion in that connection it would be necessary for him to
                                    have more precise knowledge of the implications of the
                                    proposals; the proposals were in general and broad terms.</item>

                                    <p>The Consulate at Nagoya has referred to me the hypothetical
                                        question whether it might take over the archives and
                                        property of the Chinese Consulate in the event that the
                                        latter office were to be closed.</p>
                                    <p>I would appreciate your informing the officers in your

                                        they should take the position that they would be prepared to
                                        lend their good offices in any emergency that might occur
                                        but that in the absence of authorization from the Department

                                can be said, however, that such facts as reported in Tokyo’s

                                this office has on file written statements from responsible American
                                citizens testifying to the absolutely barbarous action of Japanese
                                troops, whose officers made no apparent effort to control them,
                                after the occupation of Nanking.</p>
                            <p>While conditions have improved, discipline has not yet been
                                completely restored and we continue to receive from American
                                residents a daily average of three or four reports of rape or
                                attempted rape within the refugee zone. How many cases take place
                                without commanding the attention of these Americans it is impossible
                                to say. The Japanese are now making an attempt to get Chinese
                                refugees to return to their homes outside the refugee zone but there
                                is considerable reluctance to do so inasmuch as many of those who
                                have returned have been robbed, raped and in several cases bayoneted
                                to death by Japanese soldiers. Records of such cases are on file at
                                this office.</p>

                            <p>33. In common with British and German colleagues I have received the
                                Chairman of the International Committee for the Nanking safety <pb
                                    n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0054"/>zone, a German subject,
                                outlining difficulties which the Japanese Army has raised with
                                regard to the feeding of approximately 250,000 Chinese refugees now
                                in Nanking.</p>
                            <p>The International Committee has been distributing rice and flour free
                                to those who could not pay for it and selling it at a low price to
                                those who could. Since the morning of January 10th the Japanese Army
                                has forced them to stop sales and has said that all distribution of
                                rice and flour must be made through local Chinese Autonomous
                                Committee in cooperation with the Japanese Army. Between December
                                13th, when the Japanese occupied the city, and January 19th, the
                                army had only assigned 2,200 bags of rice and 1,000 bags of flour
                                for sale to the civilian population. Permission has been refused the
                                International Committee by the army, either to bring in rice and
                                wheat previously purchased and now outside the city walls, or to
                                have foodstuffs shipped up from Shanghai.</p>
                            <p>It is estimated by responsible American members of the International
                                Committee that a regular supply of 1,600 bags of rice a day is
                                needed adequately to feed the Chinese population. At present the
                                Japanese authorities are allowing only approximately 1,000 bags a
                                week to be distributed. A supply of at least 40 tons of coal a day
                                is also said to be needed and at present none whatever is being sold
                                commercially. It is understood that adequate supplies of foodstuffs
                                and coal are available and the action of the Japanese is therefore
                                difficult to understand.</p>
                            <p>While the situation has not yet become serious, due to stocks already
                                on hand in private families, it may easily become so at any moment.
                                The International Committee is feeding, without charge, 50,000
                                persons a day but its stocks are running low. If sufficient food and
                                fuel is not provided for these Chinese refugees it is quite possible
                                that riots may occur with consequent danger to foreign lives and
                                property.</p>
                            <p>Quite apart from the humanitarian aspect of the matter it would
                                appear that the possible danger to American interests ensuing as a
                                result of this slow starvation of thousands of Chinese might be
                                sufficient grounds for this Office to take up the question with the
                                Japanese authorities. My British colleague states that he does not
                                wish to take precipitate action, while my German colleague, who has
                                been taking an extremely strong stand with the Japanese regarding
                                the inhuman activities of their troops, is willing to approach them
                                at once. The opinion of the Ambassador in this regard would be
                                appreciated.</p>

                                        handed his credentials by the Japanese Government. Minister
                                        for Foreign Affairs commented somewhat sarcastically upon
                                        statement reported by press as emanating from spokesman of
                                        Japanese Foreign Office that members of Chinese Embassy
                                        remaining in Tokyo would not retain diplomatic status but
                                        would be treated like ordinary citizens, whereas Japanese
                                        Foreign Office apparently considers that Japanese Counselor
                                        remaining in China will be Chargé d’Affaires with all
                                        diplomatic prerogatives intact.”</p>

                            <p>Mr. Tsui called at his request. He said that on Saturday the Chinese
                                Ambassador had received a cable from the Chinese Foreign Office
                                asking the Ambassador to inform the Department that the Chinese
                                Government had informed the German Ambassador to China that the
                                Japanese peace terms, as communicated to the Chinese Government
                                through the German Ambassador, were so vague that the Chinese
                                Government desired that the Japanese Government clarify and
                                elucidate the terms; that the Japanese Foreign Minister, upon
                                receipt of this information from the Chinese Government, said that
                                because of the delay the Japanese Government had abandoned peace <pb

                                future the Japanese Government would proceed on the basis of new
                                developments. Mr. Tsui said that according to the Chinese Foreign
                                Office cablegram, the Chinese Government wished to inform us of the
                                foregoing and that peace movements had ended.</p>
                            <p>I thanked Mr. Tsui for communicating this information to us and said
                                that I would bring it to the attention of the Secretary.</p>

                                Great Britain, Germany and Italy, foreign trade and trade relations,

                            <p>[Here follows summary of address.]</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>. Mr. Hirota’s announcement regarding
                                Japan’s intentions in relation to China appears to strengthen the
                                view that the pledge regarding China’s territorial integrity will be
                                meaningless in view of the indication contained in the announcement
                                that Japan will proceed with the dismemberment of China under
                                similar fictions to that employed when Manchuria was occupied. With
                                regard to the assurances concerning the intention of Japan to
                                respect the principle of the “open door”, there are already
                                indications from reports regarding the economic program in North
                                China that this principle will be subordinated, as it was in
                                Manchuria, to the exigencies of a policy of economic
                                nationalism.</p>
                            <p>The most hopeful feature of Mr. Hirota’s address does not therefore
                                appear to lie in his pronouncements with regard to China’s
                                territorial integrity or the “open door” but in his statement that
                                “The importance to the conduct of our foreign affairs of American
                                understanding needs scarcely to be mentioned. We shall continue to
                                do our best toward the furtherance of Japanese-American amity and
                                good will”. This statement serves to indicate that the United States
                                is still in position to exercise a certain degree of moral influence
                                upon Japan although not to the extent of causing Japan to desist
                                from its present aggressive course in and with regard to China.</p>

                            <p>The Chinese Ambassador called on his own request. He referred to my
                                recent telephone message to him regarding the Chinese proposal <pb
                                    n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0059"/>that this Government take
                                over their interests in Tokyo and the lack of occasion for our doing
                                so now. He remarked that he had sent this information on to his
                                Government and had since heard nothing to the contrary. I expressed
                                the view that probably this settled the matter for an indefinite
                                period, in which he acquiesced.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador then stated that a rather serious development seems to
                                be in prospect in connection with the understanding that the
                                Japanese puppet government located at Peiping is undertaking to
                                lower or abolish certain tariffs; that this would probably be
                                chiefly or entirely for the benefit of Japan; that up until last
                                year China had been meeting her debt service, both internal and
                                external; that I, of course, would understand the large factor these
                                Chinese customs receipts constitute, and that therefore such action
                                will play havoc with their continued meeting of debt service. I
                                first inquired as to which port or ports these customs reductions
                                would probably be applied, and the Ambassador expressed the view
                                that Tientsin would be at least the chief place of entry of goods. I
                                then remarked that this Government for some time has made known its
                                position of standing for the integrity of customs organization in
                                China, as well as its reasons therefor; that naturally it has also
                                expressed its frank view when any entry of goods for the Japanese
                                Government or groups of Japanese individuals was being undertaken or
                                so reported.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador then said that he thought a declaration of war by
                                Japan was less remote now than heretofore, and he would be
                                interested to know what our policy would be in that event. I replied
                                that that was a matter I would be obliged to discuss with him if and
                                when such development actually took place; that I would not be in a
                                position to do so earlier. He at least seemed to understand the
                                situation.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador then stated that there was a report to the effect the
                                British and the Japanese have some sort of agreement whereby the
                                Japanese are to deal gently with Canton and the British are to be
                                less disposed to allow arms, ammunition, and implements of war to
                                enter China through Hong Kong. He asked if I knew anything about
                                this report, to which I replied in the negative.</p>
                            <p>He said the fighting was fairly brisk at this time.</p>

                            <p>His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are not opposed in
                                principle to a gradual withdrawal of their military establishment
                                    <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0060"/>in North China in the
                                manner indicated in the communication made by the State Department
                                on the 18th January, but they have to consider a danger which does
                                not face the United States Government since there is no United
                                States concession at Tientsin.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese military authorities in Tientsin recently demanded the
                                surrender of a Chinese in the British concession on the ground of
                                his anti-Japanese activities. They offered no evidence in support of
                                their charge and the demand was refused. They then gave a time limit
                                within which the man was to be surrendered and failing compliance
                                they threatened to enter the concession and take him by force. On
                                learning however that such action would be forcibly resisted the
                                higher Japanese authorities explained that a misunderstanding had
                                occurred.</p>
                            <p>In the light of this experience it is clear that a withdrawal or even
                                a reduction of the British garrison would encourage further attempts
                                of the same kind and possibly inflict the humiliation of violation
                                or seizure of the concession. This being so, it is suggested that,
                                unless the situation in North China deteriorates dangerously in the
                                meantime, the question of withdrawal might be left for a general
                                settlement which His Majesty’s Government hope that it may be
                                possible to initiate at a later stage.</p>
                            <p>His Majesty’s Government’s views as regards the diplomatic
                                establishments in North China are that these would constitute a
                                useful bargaining counter and that their withdrawal might also await
                                a general settlement if such a settlement is not forestalled by
                                Japanese recognition of the new provisional government or by other
                                decided action.</p>
                            <p>Should the United States Government nevertheless be in favour of an
                                early withdrawal of diplomatic and military establishments in North
                                China it is hoped that they may agree to discuss the matter further
                                with His Majesty’s Government and the French Government to whom no
                                further communication is being made by His Majesty’s Government at
                                present.</p>

                            <p>61. It is learned from unofficial but apparently reliable source that
                                during Chinese air raid on Nanking January 26 one plane was shot
                                down and one made forced landing and was captured by the Japanese.
                                Aviators in both were Russians and since this is the first time the

                                who was killed was found to be Italian. This information has been
                                released by the Chinese.</p>

                            <p>The Chinese Ambassador called on his own request. He said that his
                                Government had instructed him to inquire what the attitude of this
                                Government would be with respect to functioning in the event there
                                should be a reconvening of the Nine-Power Treaty signatories. I
                                replied that that question should really answer itself; with respect
                                to a duly called meeting of the signatories of the Nine-Power
                                Treaty, that this Government would, of course, promptly accept and
                                attend such meeting; that this was logically its situation as a
                                signatory and as a member of the Brussels Conference. I added that
                                we would likewise continue to function in connection with any duly
                                called meetings of the Advisory Committee,<note n="76"
                                    xml:id="d66fn76">For League of Nations activities, see <ref
                                        target="#pg_488">pp. 488</ref> ff.</note> if I might further
                                illustrate the situation of this Government. I then said that in my
                                opinion there was an important preliminary question about which we
                                have heard no expression from those who may be suggesting a
                                reconvening of the Nine-Power signatories, and that question was
                                whether there had been made any attempt whatsoever to forecast the
                                opportunities for substantial accomplishment by such meeting of the
                                Nine-Power Treaty signatories. I said that a meeting called
                                haphazardly, without any preliminary preparations or plans to
                                reasonably insure at least its substantial success in behalf of
                                peace, would probably be doomed to failure and this would simply
                                give a black eye to peace and to the Ambassador’s country and my
                                own; that I mentioned my own for the reason that whenever any
                                meeting or conference is in prospect, one or more important
                                governments, or those assuming to speak for them, immediately begin
                                to circulate reports and rumors which get into the press that they
                                will go as far as the United States, that they will first call upon
                                the United States to know if it will do such and such, as in case of
                                the despatch this morning that three governments are calling upon
                                the United States to join them in furnishing arms, ammunition and
                                implements of war to China, although they <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58"
                                    facs="0062"/>fully know our situation and should know that such
                                questions and statements are more harmful than helpful. I concluded
                                by suggesting to the Ambassador, in addition to my answer to his
                                inquiry, that I would like finally to emphasize again the question
                                of whether those at Geneva who convened as the members of the
                                Council, having seemingly failed to do anything themselves, are
                                merely seeking to shift the situation to another meeting of the
                                Nine-Power Treaty signatories without any thought or preparation, as
                                stated. I said that I was not making this observation from the
                                standpoint of either encouraging or discouraging a meeting of the
                                Nine-Power Treaty signatories, but for the reason that ought to be
                                manifest to every practical statesman having anything to do with the
                                matter.</p>

                            <p>I have been deeply moved by the warm tone in which you have responded
                                to my appeal. Your earnest hope for a settlement of the present
                                conflict with such reasonable provisions as you have indicated
                                coincides with the very object of our sanguinary struggle against
                                Japan’s aggression and vandalism. We are not only defending our own
                                rights and our own national integrity, but also striving for the
                                preservation of the rights and interests of all powers concerned. In
                                    <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0064"/>a settlement you have
                                visualized, we will show due regard even for Japan’s rights and
                                legitimate interests in China.</p>
                            <p>I am happy to learn that you are giving constant study and thought to
                                the problem of the ways and means which may contribute most
                                effectively toward promoting peace and facilitating international
                                cooperation. The United States has always played a leading role in
                                the promotion of international peace and order in general and
                                justice and harmony in the Far East in particular. We recall with
                                gratification the historical instances in which the United States
                                endeavored to meet the disturbing conditions in this part of the
                                world with timely and helpful intervention. At the end of the last
                                century when China was going through the most trying period of her
                                diplomatic relations, it was the American Government which initiated
                                (and has ever since upheld) the principle of equal opportunity for
                                the commerce and industry of all nations. It was again through the
                                effort of the President of the United States of America as mediator
                                that a Far Eastern conflict in the beginning of this century was
                                brought to an end.<note n="83" xml:id="d70fn83">President Theodore

                            <p>Your great country has not only significantly contributed toward the
                                general cause of peace and concord in the Far East, but has from
                                time to time given exemplary assistance of one kind or another to
                                the Government and the people of China. The United States was the
                                first country which remitted to China the American portion of the
                                indemnity of 1901. The American universities and colleges have
                                imparted useful knowledge to countless Chinese youth who, imbued
                                with American ideals, have returned to render valuable service in
                                the development of this country. The American generous public has
                                given us inestimable aid and relief in time of dire need. American
                                financial help such as the Cotton and Wheat Loan has contributed in
                                no small measure to China’s success in carrying out her plan of
                                national rehabilitation and reconstruction. The American Government
                                was the first to conclude with the Chinese Government a treaty
                                restoring to China the right to tariff autonomy.<note n="85"

                            <p>It is the acknowledged leadership of the American Government in the
                                common task for seeking international peace and security that has
                                led all other powers to look to the United States for co-operation
                                in <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0065"/>dealing with the present
                                catastrophe in the Far East. It is on the strength of the unexcelled
                                Sino-American friendship that China naturally looks to the United
                                States for assistance during our momentous struggle for national
                                existence. Permit me, Mr. President, to appeal to you once more to
                                do everything possible to help hasten the end of Japan’s aggression
                                and the realization of the ideal for which both China and the United
                                States of America firmly stand. It is our urgent wish that the
                                United States will enable us to continue our resistance. I leave it
                                to Your Excellency to decide what further measures may be adopted by
                                the United States to bring about the final settlement you have in
                                mind. I am as confident as ever that our common cause for peace and
                                justice for the sanctity of treaties and for orderly and amicable
                                relationship among nations is destined to win.</p>

                                <item>The period of military and political quiet in China which has
                                    existed since the Japanese Government’s announcement of policy
                                    on January 14 [<hi rend="italic">16</hi>]<note n="88"

                                    begun to raise in the Japanese popular mind some perplexity and
                                    doubt as to future developments. The official announcements had
                                    been preceded by several weeks of mysterious discussions within
                                    the Government and had a somewhat theatrical setting. For a
                                    short time it was believed that the ground was being prepared
                                    for some powerful blow which was to be dealt to China either in
                                    a political sense or in a military sense or both. Continued
                                    inactivity is therefore tending to become anticlimatic and is
                                    having adverse effect on public morale.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>It is therefore in an atmosphere tinctured with some degree of
                                    pessimism and perplexity that reports were received of
                                    discussions between Great Britain, France and Soviet Russia with
                                    regard to some form of systematic aid to China. If such an
                                    arrangement were reached it is obvious that it could not be
                                    ignored by Japan without risking a collapse of public confidence
                                    in Japan’s ability to meet any challenge from European quarters.
                                    The logical step for Japan to take to support that confidence
                                    would be to declare war. It is realized by the Japanese that
                                    such measure would not facilitate the prevention of the entry of
                                    arms from Indochina and Soviet Russia and that the closing of
                                    the Hong Kong route would merely divert the traffic to the <pb
                                        n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0067"/>other routes. The
                                    practical results would be small but the belief prevails amongst
                                    many Japanese that if Japan were not to take formal cognizance
                                    of any such arrangement if made the moral consequences in Japan
                                    itself would be extremely serious.</item>

                                    discount reports from correspondents affecting to know that a

                                        in substance, that we—that is, Great Britain—have no actual
                                        treaty with the United States, but we have an understanding

                                        reference to our foreign policy; and when asked what was

                                        with reference to the eastern question particularly, and
                                        that it was of such nature that it must be kept a

                                invasion of China by Japan. Japanese armies have succeeded during
                                this time, at enormous cost in lives, material and treasure, in
                                driving the Nationalist Government of China and its armies away from
                                the coast, from Shanghai to Shanhaikwan, and have occupied the
                                ruined and depopulated cities of Hangchow, Shanghai, Soochow, Wusih,
                                Nanking, and Wuhu. They hold Tsingtao, Tsinan, Taiyuan, Tientsin and
                                Peiping. They have systematically destroyed Chinese industry in
                                these areas. They control the railways between Shanghai and Suiyuan,
                                and a good part of the Peiping–Hankow Railway. Japanese bombing
                                planes based within this area are able at will to bomb practically
                                all of the other commercial centers of China. It is believed that
                                Japanese military forces, if disposed to do so, and at further
                                considerable expense of lives, material and treasure, can in time
                                occupy the Lunghai Railway, Hankow and the rest of the railway
                                between Peiping and Hankow. If this happens Japanese military forces
                                will then have occupied practically the whole of the Yangtze and
                                Yellow River valleys where the bulk of China’s population lives and
                                from which it draws the bulk of its food supply. But the Japanese
                                military will still be a long way from conquering or occupying the
                                whole of China.</p>
                            <p>The intellectual life which has dominated the areas thus occupied and
                                which has given character to modern Nationalist China will then have
                                been driven into the western, more mountainous and less fertile
                                areas. There is no apparent evidence that this intellectual
                                leadership and what is left of its armed forces are prepared to
                                capitulate and make peace. It is true that what is left of China’s
                                armed forces will be without equipment necessary to enable it to
                                wage effective offensive war on the plains, but it will still have
                                access to sufficient quantities of small arms and ammunition to
                                enable it to equip mobile units which will roam the country
                                attacking trains, destroying crops and supplies, attacking Japanese
                                and those working with them. The Japanese military will therefore
                                have to garrison its holdings and police every mile of the lines of
                                communications along which supplies for its forces must be carried.
                                The future prospect for the plains occupied by the Japanese during
                                the next 3 or 4 years promises little in the way of peaceful
                                development. I believe that conditions throughout those areas will
                                be chaotic in the extreme, with robberies, assassinations, and
                                kidnappings.</p>
                            <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0069"/>
                            <p>The prospect for the immediate future is hopeless unless Japan is
                                prepared to send far greater forces into China to enable her to
                                garrison and police the occupied areas. Trade is and will continue
                                to be completely disrupted. Chinese industry no longer exists.
                                Travel in the interior is already well nigh impossible.</p>
                            <p>The situation as between China and Japan at the present time is
                                therefore at a stalemate, with Japan’s armies carrying destruction
                                into the very areas from whose population she apparently expected to
                                receive cooperation and where she expected to market her goods.</p>
                            <p>A declaration of war will not in my opinion materially affect this
                                situation. It will have its effect upon trade through Hong Kong and
                                possibly Hanoi, but it will not lessen the necessity for Japan to
                                continue the present heavy expense and future military operations.
                                It will not close China’s back doors through India, Burma and
                                Turkestan. Japanese hostilities have entered the stage of long time
                                operations to pacify immense areas where the populations have been
                                impoverished and terrorized. Japan must soon come to a realization
                                that up to the present time all that her efforts have netted her has
                                been hostility abroad and expense in China. Japan can hardly expect
                                to recoup this expense from Chinese trade in another 20 or 30
                                years.</p>
                            <p>Repeated to Peiping and Shanghai. Shanghai please relay to Tokyo and
                                show to Commander-in-Chief.</p>

                                    Times</hi> on January 26 stated “Now triumphant soldiers in
                                occupied Nanking are enjoying the fruits of military victory by
                                looting and ravaging of helpless Chinese. It is thus Japan is
                                bringing order into China”. The <hi rend="italic">Philadelphia
                                    Inquirer</hi> asserts “Although there may be grounds for
                                charging the Nanking lawlessness to mutinous troops, the fact
                                remains that Japan’s whole program of aggression in China has been
                                such as to incite its soldiery to brutal acts”. The <hi
                                    rend="italic">Baltimore Sun</hi> refers to the behavior of
                                Japanese soldiery as “shocking”. The stiffening Chinese resistance
                                is epitomized in such expressions as “Japan is in trouble up to her
                                neck”, and “War Not Over Yet”, some even predicting Japan’s ultimate
                                ruin. Skepticism of recent declarations in the Diet that foreign
                                rights would be respected is expressed in such editorial titles as
                                “Deceptive Diplomacy”, “Meaningless Words”, “Fair Words from Japan”,
                                “Open Door But How Open?”.</p>
                            <p>There is considerable editorial sentiment in favor of depriving Japan
                                of materials and resources with which to consolidate her aggression.
                                On January 28 in Washington a league of women shoppers held a “Life
                                Without Silk” fashion show to dramatize and encourage individual
                                boycotting of Japanese silk. Evidently alarmed by actual and
                                prospective boycotting, a delegation of hosiery workers on the same
                                day held a parade in Washington to advertise the extent to which
                                American labor would be penalized by a boycott of silk.</p>

                                    Embassy in China.</note> that the Secretary of State had said to
                                the Chinese Ambassador in regard to reports that Great Britain,
                                France and the Soviet Union were discussing plan for assisting China
                                to resist Japan, that the United States would go as far as other
                                powers in aiding China but declined to commit itself in regard to
                                any plan still in stage of discussion. The remark of the Vice
                                Minister was made casually in a general conversation but may be of
                                interest.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Broadmead called me on the ‘phone and, referring to the
                                Department’s <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of January 31, said
                                that the British Embassy had a message from the Foreign Office
                                stating that the Foreign Office had complied with our request that
                                they communicate with the French Government. Also, that the British
                                Government does not intend at this time to reduce its armed forces
                                in north China.</p>

                                made a statement in the Diet on February 2 as follows: “There is no
                                Chinese Central Government recognized by Japan. A state of war
                                exists between the two countries”. A further press report from Tokyo
                                under date February 3 states that Prince Konoye, in reply to a
                                question in the Diet, “indicated that Japan did not intend to
                                declare war on China formally at present, but said it was reasonable
                                to expect that under conditions which might arise in the future, a
                                declaration might be issued”.</p>

                                    Wang.</note> called on me at his request. During the course of
                                the ensuing conversation I referred by way of illustration to a
                                press report from Geneva that various foreign governments
                                contemplated approaching the American Government in regard to a
                                proposal to extend credits to China for the purchase of arms and
                                munitions. I said to the Ambassador that he knew the situation in
                                this country in regard to a question of that sort and that I of
                                course assumed that the representatives of any governments which
                                might have presented to them for consideration any such plan would
                                have knowledge and understanding of the situation here in this
                                regard, I made no statement of the nature mentioned in your telegram

                                otherwise. He further said that the British would act to defend Hong

                                        of such nature that it must be kept a secret.</p>
                                    <p>“On the other hand, the fact that Mr. Borah’s allegation is
                                        unfounded does not mean, as the Secretary of State pointed
                                        out in the course of his speech in the House of Commons on
                                        the 21st December last, to which the Senator perhaps
                                        alludes, that the existing situation in the Far East has not
                                        necessitated constant and close consultation between the
                                        Governments of the United States and Great Britain. Such
                                        consultation, which is natural in view of the similarity of
                                        the interests of the two countries in that part of the
                                        world, is of course perfectly consistent with the pursuit of
                                        an independent policy by the two governments, but Mr. Eden,
                                        as he endeavored to make plain in his above mentioned
                                        speech, rejoices, like all men of good will of both sides of
                                        the Atlantic, at the fact that during a period of
                                        international anxiety our two countries are moving on
                                        parallel lines”.</p>

                                    the war in the Far East. An article in yesterday’s <hi

                                    Soviet Union by intimating “that the Soviet Union is preparing
                                    to make an attack on Japan”. The article continues: “they are
                                    trying to frighten the Japanese to persuade them that it is
                                    necessary to hurry and beat the Soviet Union to it. On the other
                                    hand they are endeavoring to provoke the Soviet Union by trying
                                    to prove the necessity of a preventive move against Japan. In
                                    vain are the reactionary English circles secretly nourishing the
                                    hope that they will be able to turn the wave of aggression away
                                    from the British Empire.”</item>

                            <p>80. Department’s 38, February 4, 5 p.m. There was no session on
                                February 2nd of either House of the Diet. There was a meeting on
                                that day of the Budget Committee but we find no record of any

                            <p>49. Yesterday afternoon Major General Amaya, the new garrison
                                commander, gave a welcoming tea at the Japanese Embassy for the
                                foreign diplomatic representatives in Nanking during the course of
                                    <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0077"/>which he made a long
                                statement outlining his opinion on the local situation and in which
                                he criticised the attitude of the foreigners who had been sending
                                abroad reports of Japanese atrocities and encouraging the Chinese in
                                their anti-Japanese feeling. The gist of the statement is given
                                below. Because of the importance and length of the statement an
                                opportunity was taken of checking this morning with my British and
                                German colleagues for possible errors or omissions and it is
                                therefore believed that the following summary is substantially
                                complete.</p>
                            <p>The General regretted the prominence which had been given abroad to
                                reports of atrocities committed in Nanking by Japanese troops and in
                                extenuation pointed out the long and strenuous fighting and the
                                unexpected strong resistance of the Chinese. The rapid advance had
                                caused the failure of food supplies and the exhaustion of the troops
                                had led to a lack of discipline and hence looting and violence.
                                However, he added that the Japanese troops were the best disciplined
                                in the world and that in the Russo-Japanese War and in the
                                Manchurian incident which had been comparatively mild there had been
                                no atrocities. He hoped Europeans and Americans would refrain from
                                criticism and remain onlookers and to respect the great Japanese
                                nation. Endeavors were now being made to restore discipline. The
                                Japanese troops were not hostile to Chinese citizens but they were
                                angry at the existence of snipers and spies among the latter
                                resulting from the anti-Japanese spirit which Chiang Kai Shek had
                                instilled among the people as well as among the Chinese
                                soldiers.</p>
                            <p>It was stated to be the desire of the Japanese military to restore
                                order and normal conditions in Nanking as soon as possible. In
                                Yangchow, from which place the General has just come, relations
                                between Chinese and Japanese were good but in Nanking interference
                                by foreigners which encouraged continuance of anti-Japanese feeling
                                amongst the local Chinese population had hindered a return to normal
                                and large numbers of Chinese continued to live in the so-called
                                “safety zone.” He referred to particularly reports and activities of
                                nationals of a “certain country” which was damaging relations
                                between Japanese and that country (this obviously refers to the
                                United States). The General expressed dislike of the attitude of a
                                judge in a law court taken by the foreigners and warned them that
                                their criticisms and interference between the Chinese and Japanese
                                would anger the Japanese troops and might lead to some unpleasant
                                incident. He asked to be trusted and gave assurances that he would
                                do his best to restore order and normal life in the country and that
                                foreign lives and property would be protected. He requested foreign
                                representatives to discuss their difficulties with him as far as
                                they concerned protection against foreign property but to refrain
                                from interference with matters which concerned the Chinese.</p>
                            <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0078"/>
                            <p>After conclusion of the statement he asked for criticisms and
                                comments from the foreigners present but none of them spoke. When
                                asked if it would be possible to have a copy of the remarks,
                                Counselor Hidaka of the Japanese Embassy stated that it was not an
                                official announcement.</p>
                            <p>He denied statement was obviously directed mainly against the
                                International Relief Committee, composed mostly of Americans but
                                with a German chairman. This commission has been feeding 50,000
                                Chinese refugees daily and has been extremely active in attempting
                                to prevent and in reporting Japanese atrocities. In view of his [<hi

                                local military authorities to the International Committee,
                                instructions are requested as to how far this Office should go in

                            <p>The Chinese Ambassador called at his own request, primarily, he said,
                                to inform me of his call on the President to present to him a letter
                                from Chiang Kai-shek, and also to hand me a copy of the same
                                    letter.<note n="11" xml:id="d87fn11">Dated January 30, <ref
                                        target="#pg_59">p. 59</ref>.</note></p>
                            <p>I inquired what news he had from China. He said that the fighting was
                                stiff and that his people were making a good showing. I further
                                inquired what he knew about the reports in the press today to the
                                effect that a large amount of war supplies had gone into China
                                through Hong Kong. He promptly replied that the reports were true
                                and that such supplies should be helpful for some time.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador then said that what his country needed was credit, and
                                since they were making extensive purchases of goods in this country,
                                his Government was very anxious for all possible cooperation here in
                                the establishment of credits. I replied that, of course, his
                                Government had considerable available liquid credits here in this
                                country now. He agreed that this was true and that the credits were
                                very substantial. I then commented further that thus far China had
                                only purchased six or seven million dollars of arms and implements
                                of war from this country. He did not press the matter further except
                                to say that they were looking ahead in thus requesting credits.</p>
                            <p>I went on to say that at present we were interested almost entirely
                                in the passage of the increased armament measure and in getting
                                before the country more clearly our situation and our policies.</p>

                            <p>The Ambassador then inquired as to the significance of the withdrawal
                                of the United States armed forces from Tientsin. I replied that
                                sometime before the fighting broke out in July last, my associates
                                in the Department were collaborating in the plan relative to the
                                withdrawal of these troops; that the War Department had wanted them
                                returned, for one reason, among others, that it was not considered a
                                wholesome policy to keep these troops in one place and away from
                                this country for an indefinite period of time; that, therefore, what
                                is taking place in connection with their evacuation is just about
                                what would have occurred at this time had no fighting arisen between
                                China and Japan, and, therefore, there is no significance to the
                                withdrawal of these troops from the standpoint of China or any other
                                government; that they are no longer of any great use where they are
                                now located and this is a further reason for their evacuation. I
                                said I might go further and say that if trouble had not arisen
                                between China and Japan, the Chinese Government and my Government
                                equally would have agreed in the desire for these troops to come out
                                not later than this date; and that the policy of the Chinese
                                Government relative to the discontinuance of extraterritoriality at
                                Shanghai and elsewhere would have been carried out by this time,
                                including the removal of all remaining guards of foreign
                                governments. The Ambassador did not take issue with this view.</p>
                            <p>I finally remarked that from every viewpoint, therefore, it must be
                                apparent to him and his Government that there is no significance in
                                the evacuation of this regiment from Tientsin. I said further that
                                the British had recalled their troops temporarily sent to Shanghai
                                just as we had recalled ours temporarily sent to that city; and that
                                we took this action in sending the Marines and returning them upon
                                the recommendation of Admiral Yarnell in charge of the Asiatic
                                squadron.</p>

                            <p>The French Chargé d’Affaires called to see me this morning to take up
                                with me various matters by instruction of his Government.</p>
                            <p>The French Government was concerned because of the receipt of
                                information that the Government of the United States intended to
                                withdraw a portion of its armed forces from China in the near
                                future. Mr. Henry explained the point of view of his Government in
                                this regard as contained in a memorandum<note n="12"
                                    xml:id="d88fn12"><hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> which he
                                left with me and <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0080"/>which he
                                asked me to regard as entirely personal and informal. I told him
                                that I would reply in the same manner within the next few days.</p>
                            <p>He then referred to an instruction which he had received from his
                                Government requesting him to inform the Department of State of the
                                reasons which had caused the French Government to modify in two
                                regards the note which the French Government transmitted to the
                                Japanese Government at the same time as those sent by the United
                                    States<note n="13" xml:id="d88fn13">Note dated February 5, <ref

                                Great Britain. As reported in a recent cable from London, the point
                                of view of the French Government in this regard was that inasmuch as
                                the French Government did not have the same budgetary complications
                                as those confronting the United States and Great Britain, there was
                                no need for it to fix February 20 as the date before which it
                                desired to have a reply from Japan with regard to the construction
                                of naval units. Furthermore, the increase in the navies of the
                                United States and of Great Britain was in large part contingent,
                                according to the French Government, upon the rumored increase in the
                                Japanese navy, whereas the French navy was not in the same situation
                                and if the French Government had adopted the same language as that
                                utilized by the United States and Great Britain in their notes to
                                Japan, the French Government believed that it would immediately have
                                incurred the suspicions of Italy and Germany. It was for these
                                reasons the French Government desired us to know that they had
                                decided to modify the language of the suggested note to the Japanese
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>Finally, the French Government had been informed through its Embassy
                                in China of the negotiations which had been taking place between the
                                American Consul General and the British representatives in Shanghai
                                and the Japanese authorities with regard to the question of Chinese
                                    customs.<note n="14" xml:id="d88fn14">See <ref target="#pg_626"
                                        >pp. 626</ref> ff.</note> The French Government desired to
                                know if any final conclusions had been reached by the United States
                                Government with regard to this matter. I replied to Mr. Henry by
                                saying that the matter of Chinese customs was one which was so
                                complicated and concerning which there had been so much
                                correspondence that I was unable, unfortunately, to answer his query
                                immediately but that I would be glad to look into the matter and
                                advise him of our present position within the next few days.</p>

                            <p>On the occasion of the partial withdrawal of American troops from
                                Northern China, it is recalled that last December, the British
                                Government had approached the French Government requesting for an
                                expression of opinion concerning a project attributed to the
                                Japanese Government to recognize the new Peiping administration.</p>
                            <p>The French Foreign Office called the attention of the British Embassy
                                in Paris to the fact that the Protocol of 1901<note n="16"

                                        312</ref>.</note> (Diplomatic Missions, military protection
                                and liberty of communication between Peiping and the sea) is a
                                collective pact signed by China on one side and the Representatives
                                of other Governments on the other side, and that, should
                                modifications be found necessary in that pact, they should be
                                brought about only after an exchange of views between the interested
                                Governments. The French Government added that it did not think the
                                time had come when such a change could take place. It pointed out
                                the necessity of avoiding to give the Chinese Government the
                                impression that Peiping was no longer under Chinese Sovereignty.
                                Furthermore, it might encourage Japanese ambitions. The French
                                Foreign Office also pointed out that any decision concerning the
                                Peiping area might affect the security and the future of foreign
                                concessions in Tientsin. Of course, the French Government clearly
                                realized that the development of events in the Far East would
                                necessitate the revision some time of the position of the different
                                Powers in the regions of Peiping and Tientsin, but such a revision
                                should, in its opinion, be carefully prepared by conversations
                                between the United States, Great Britain and France.</p>
                            <p>After the British Government had been informed of the position of the
                                French Government, the matter brought up in the British Embassy’s
                                note to the French Foreign Office was set aside.</p>
                            <p>Today, on the occasion of the American decision, the French
                                Government still feels that any important changes made by the United
                                States, Great Britain or France, in their military and diplomatic
                                position in Northern China, will give China and Japan the
                                impression, that those countries are more or less indifferent to the
                                future of that, region. The Protocol of 1901 constitutes a sort of
                                limitation to Japanese action in Northern China and protects Chinese
                                as well as foreign interests, and it is recalled that last December,
                                the Chinese Ambassador in London emphasized the importance of that
                                particular point before the British Government.</p>
                            <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0082"/>
                            <p>The French Government feels that the decision of the American
                                Government may strengthen the position of the Japanese. Furthermore,
                                any restriction of the rights presently enjoyed by the Powers in
                                Northern China may weaken their diplomatic position when the time
                                comes for negotiating changes in the provisions of the Protocol of
                                1901.</p>
                            <p>As stated above, in the opinion of the French Government, it would be
                                advisable that any changes which might be contemplated in the
                                present <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>, take place after
                                consultation between the interested Powers.</p>

                            <p>53. I have just been informed by Bos, of the Netherlands Legation,
                                who has come to Nanking for a few days, that in a conversation this
                                morning with Fukui<note n="17" xml:id="d90fn17">Japanese Consul
                                    General at Nanking.</note> the actions and reports of the
                                foreigners in Nanking were severely criticized. According to Bos,
                                Fukui tried to impress upon him that conditions here were improving
                                daily, that the Japanese soldiers were well under control and that
                                any reports to the contrary made by foreigners were just
                                “anti-Japanese propaganda”.</p>
                            <p>While it is true that conditions have improved to some extent there
                                are still numerous reports of disorder and violence committed by
                                Japanese soldiers. A similar attempt has been made to impress upon
                                the Japanese authorities that complaints made to them of the actions
                                of Japanese troops are not the result of anti-Japanese feeling but
                                are made in an effort to assist the responsible people to know what
                                is going on and thus put a stop to it. However, with the Acting
                                Japanese Consul General adopting the attitude shown above,
                                constructive work is almost impossible.</p>

                                with its first issue on January 11, 1938, it is desired that you
                                follow carefully editorials and leading articles in this publication
                                which may be helpful to you in your evaluations of the political
                                situation in China. It is realized that your office is confronted at
                                the present time with an unusual amount of work incidental to
                                disturbed conditions in your district and that this circumstance may
                                for the time being make it impossible for you to examine closely the
                                material in question. It is hoped, however, that you will later be
                                able to give careful attention to the contents of this communist
                                daily.</p>
                            <p>The Department is especially interested in obtaining information with
                                regard to important developments in the communist movement in China,
                                such as, for example, the inspiration, aims, and policies of the
                                Communist Party of China; the present influence of the communist
                                movement upon Chinese political or social conditions, and the
                                reaction of high government officials to the movement. It is
                                believed that the material in the <hi rend="italic">Hsin Hu Shih
                                    Pao</hi>, supplemented by that obtainable through other
                                channels, will prove of value in the preparation of political
                                reports pertaining to this subject and that it also will prove of
                                assistance to the Embassy in estimating the influence of the
                                Communist Party of China in national developments.</p>
                            <p>China has long been regarded by the Communist International as the
                                leading example of a colonial country exploited by “imperialist”
                                countries. The solution formerly advanced by the Communist
                                International for the correction of this alleged situation was the
                                overthrow of the Central Government in China by force and violence,
                                the setting up of a soviet form of government, the abolition of
                                extraterritorial privileges enjoyed by foreigners, and a close
                                alliance between a contemplated new Chinese Government and the
                                Soviet Union.</p>
                            <p>At the Seventh World Congress of the Communist International in the
                                summer of 1935 Communists made substantial modification of their
                                program of world revolution. With regard to China it appears that
                                preparations were made for the abandonment of several points in the
                                program of the Communist Party of China to which prominent
                                non-communist Chinese had taken exception. The more important of
                                these points which subsequently were abandoned were the advocacy of
                                violence for the overthrow of the Kuomintang, and agitation for the
                                forcible confiscation of property to be followed by the introduction
                                of a soviet form of government. These modifications were made for
                                the purpose of bringing about a united front in China in opposition
                                to Japan. The Communists hope that because of these modifications
                                they will be accepted by the Kuomintang as participants in the
                                present Chinese Government. Communists frankly admit that a united
                                front government will not provide a solution for the internal <pb
                                    n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0084"/>difficulties of China. They
                                look upon it as merely a step in the direction of their ultimate
                                goal: a Soviet Government of China.</p>

                            <p>2. After stating that instigators of war “whether English or others”
                                “will not succeed in seeing the Soviet Union follow “a policy on
                                orders from anyone, or as a result of pressure from anyone, or on
                                account of anyone’s promises”, the article continues: <quote

                                    <p>“The Soviet Government, unwaveringly adhering to a policy of

                                        violators of peace, with the violators of Soviet frontiers.
                                        No stormy international orchestra of slander and excitement
                                        can shake the iron Soviet resolution and calmness.”</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>3. The article in question has been given so prominent a place in the
                                newspaper and [<hi rend="italic">that it?</hi>] is intended to
                                represent a statement of Soviet foreign policy particularly with
                                regard to the Far East.</p>
                            <p>4. The above passage is so worded as to make it subject to two
                                different interpretations. Examined from a strictly grammatical
                                point of view it would appear to mean that the Soviet Union will go
                                to war only in the event of an invasion of Soviet territory by an
                                aggressor. Since the article appears to be devoted almost entirely
                                to the denial of Soviet intentions to attack Japan, it is believed
                                that the passage above quoted is intended to relate only to the
                                conditions under which the Soviet Government would go to war in the
                                Far East. It contains no geographic reservations and taken literally
                                may be construed to apply to Soviet foreign policy in general.</p>
                            <p>5. The article also contains an attack upon “a certain important
                                personage from the Afghan Embassy”, apparently the Afghan
                                Ambassador, whom it accuses of spreading “inciting rumors in regard
                                to preparation by the Soviet Union for war with Japan”. The writer
                                asks “was it for this reason that this personage was sent here by
                                the Afghan Government.”</p>
                            <p>I doubt if this charge has any foundation. I have had numerous
                                conversations with the Afghan Ambassador and have never heard him
                                even mention the Far Eastern situation. It is my belief as well as
                                that of other members of the Diplomatic Corps that this attack is
                                motivated by Soviet displeasure with the attitude taken by him with
                                regard to the Soviet request that Afghan Consulates in the Soviet
                                Union be closed (see my despatch No. 899 of January 31, 1938<note
                                    n="24" xml:id="d93fn24">Not printed.</note>) and can be
                                partially attributed to the fact that he is the first dean of the
                                Diplomatic Corps for many years who has made any real effort to
                                prevail upon the Soviet authorities to grant to the Diplomatic Corps
                                privileges and courtesies customarily extended by other governments
                                to members of foreign diplomatic missions. It is believed also from
                                the wording of the attack that it represents an effort on the part
                                of the Soviet authorities to bring pressure upon the members of the
                                Diplomatic Corps to prevent them from exchanging with one another
                                their views regarding Soviet policies.</p>

                            <p>100. 1. My British colleague,<note n="25" xml:id="d94fn25">Sir Robert
                                    L. Craigie, British Ambassador in Japan.</note> who talks to me
                                freely and so far as I can judge frankly, has told me of the
                                following conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on
                                February 9 which would appear to be significant owing to the marked
                                change in the Minister’s usually placid, courteous and friendly
                                bearing. The fact that for the first time in our respective dealings
                                with him Hirota twice lost his temper with Craigie might be due to
                                nervousness engendered by the strain of the current sessions of the
                                Diet or the mounting irritation at the tone, insistence and volume
                                of Craigie’s continual representations both oral and written in
                                connection with British interests in China or perhaps to both. The
                                Minister’s demeanor tends to confirm reports which have come to both
                                Craigie and myself that Hirota is steadily becoming harder and more
                                intransigent as regards foreign interests in the Far East and that
                                it is Hirota rather than Suetsugu<note n="26" xml:id="d94fn26"
                                    >Admiral Nobumasa Suetsugu, Japanese Minister for Home
                                    Affairs.</note> who leads the ultra-chauvinistic element in the
                                Government. I myself have as yet seen no outward demonstration of
                                any change of attitude on Hirota’s part as regards American
                                interests.</p>
                            <p>2. The conversation referred to arose when Craigie informed the
                                Minister that he is in possession of evidence indicating that
                                Japanese forces have occupied several of the smaller Chinese islands
                                in the general vicinity of Hong Kong and again asked for specific
                                assurances that the statements of the Japanese Government that it
                                has no territorial designs in China apply as well to the islands as
                                to the mainland. According to Craigie, the Minister in some
                                instances in their intercourse became very angry, inveighed against
                                the continual British demands for renewed assurances, said that
                                under present war conditions Japan had given all the assurances that
                                can reasonably be expected, and asserted that if the warfare is
                                prolonged Japan may be forced to occupy more territory whether
                                insular or on the mainland. If the warfare becomes permanent, said
                                Hirota, the occupation will also be permanent. Referring
                                specifically to Hainan, Hirota said that the Japanese could not
                                possibly give a permanent pledge not to occupy. Craigie pointed out
                                that whereas Hong Kong cannot be regarded as a threat to Japan, the
                                occupation of these islands by Japanese forces does constitute a
                                very real threat to Hong Kong. The general tone of this conversation
                                appears to have been acrimonious.</p>
                            <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0087"/>
                            <p>3. Craigie is aware that there are large concentration[s] of Japanese
                                troops in Formosa (see our 61, January 31 [<hi rend="italic"
                                >30</hi>], 6 p.m.<note n="27" xml:id="d94fn27">Not printed.</note>)
                                and of Japanese ships in the port of Takao and he believes that an
                                attack on Canton or some other point in South China is
                                impending.</p>
                            <p>4. Craigie’s general reaction to this conversation with Hirota is
                                that the longer the warfare is prolonged the greater will be the
                                likelihood of permanent occupation by Japan not only of the islands
                                but of territory on the mainland. He believes that Japanese
                                assurances of “no territorial designs” are likely to be withdrawn at
                                short notice. These prospects so seriously concern British interests
                                that he contemplates recommending or has already recommended to his
                                Government (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) that continued support of
                                Chiang Kai Shek, whether by furnishing war supplies and funds or
                                otherwise, is detrimental to British interests and (<hi
                                    rend="italic">b</hi>) that the British Government should be
                                alert to foster any outlook for peace negotiations which might leave
                                to China any hope of eventual resurrection.</p>
                            <p>5. Craigie is informed and believes that it was the Japanese
                                industrialists and politicians and not the military who favored and
                                brought about the withdrawal of recognition from the Central
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>6. I think that the nature of the conversation reported above
                                indicates that our own practice of concentrating our representations
                                to the Minister on important issues and with discreet timing is
                                likely to prove more effective than the British practice of constant
                                hammering by almost daily notes, letters, and other communications
                                with continual personal visits to the Minister or the Vice Minister
                                both on important and routine issues. The British procedure appears
                                to be based on the theory that constant hammering will wear away a
                                stone but in the present temper of the Japanese Government and
                                military this practice is liable to defeat its own object through
                                the irritation which it inevitably engenders, clearly demonstrated
                                in Craigie’s last interview with the Minister. The representations
                                of the American Government are at least listened to with respect and
                                an evident inclination on the part of the Foreign Office to meet our
                                wishes so far as the military can be influenced in that
                                direction.</p>
                            <p>7. About 2 weeks ago Craigie told me that he had heard from a
                                trustworthy source that there was to be a change for the better in
                                the Japanese attitude toward Great Britain and that press and other
                                agitation against the British was to be discontinued. I did not put
                                much stock in Craigie’s information. Since then General Matsui<note

                                create political issues out of the problem of preserving <pb n="84"
                                    xml:id="pg_84" facs="0088"/>British economic and commercial
                                interests in China while the Japanese press has expressed the
                                conviction that it was Great Britain which initiated the three-power
                                    <hi rend="italic">démarche</hi> with regard to naval
                                construction. The feeling in Japan against the British is not in our
                                opinion altogether artificially created as Craigie believes it to be
                                but flows from the conviction that the British are constantly
                                endeavoring to establish a common front against Japan in order to
                                preserve British political and economic interests in the Far

                            <p>255. A number of acts of terrorism were committed last week. Four
                                severed heads of Chinese were discovered in the French Concession,
                                the first being that of the editor of an anti-Japanese vernacular
                                paper, the other three not having been identified. To two of the
                                heads were attached warnings in Chinese against carrying on
                                anti-Japanese activities. Bombs were also detonated without injuring
                                any one, on the premises of the <hi rend="italic">Shanghai Evening
                                    Post and Mercury</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Hwa Mei Wan
                                    Pao</hi> which is allegedly partially owned by an American
                                citizen and a vernacular paper being operated by British subject. It
                                is understood that Chinese employed by these papers received
                                threatening letters before the bombings occurred warning them not to
                                publish further anti-Japanese items. In the case of the bombing of
                                the <hi rend="italic">Evening Post and Mercury</hi>, the police
                                arrested two Chinese who have confessed the crime but from whom no
                                information appears to have been elicited thus far regarding the
                                identity of the party or parties who instigated the bombings. It is
                                believed in some circles, however, that both the bombings and
                                beheadings were committed by a terrorist organization working
                                directly or indirectly under Japanese direction.</p>

                                report, in duplicate, on H. Res. 418, “Requesting the President of
                                the United States to furnish certain information pertaining to the
                                diplomatic relationship between Japan and China”.<note n="31"

                            <p>With regard to the inquiry contained in section (1) of the
                                Resolution, the Department has information to the effect that,
                                although the Japanese Ambassador to China has returned to Japan, the
                                Counselor of the Embassy has remained in China as Chargé
                                d’Affaires.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the inquiry contained in section (2) of the
                                Resolution, the Department has been informed that the Chinese
                                Ambassador to Japan returned to China under instruction from his
                                Government but that he was not handed his credentials by the
                                Japanese Government, and that the Counselor of the Chinese Embassy
                                has remained in Japan as Chargé d’Affaires. On January 21 the
                                spokesman of the Japanese Foreign Office made a statement to the
                                press as follows: “Although it has ceased to deal with General
                                Chiang Kai-Shek’s regime, the Japanese Government will continue to
                                accord diplomatic and consular privileges to Chinese diplomatic and
                                consular officials representing the National Government.” It appears
                                to be the view of the Japanese Government that the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >de jure</hi> status of the Japanese and Chinese diplomatic and
                                consular officials in China and Japan, respectively, remains
                                unchanged.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the inquiry in section (3) of the Resolution, it is
                                believed that the remark attributed to Mr. Hirota as quoted in the
                                Resolution is based upon a press report from Tokyo under date
                                February 2 which refers to a statement made in the Diet on February
                                2. The Department has been officially informed that there was no
                                session of the Diet on February 2 and that the press report probably
                                has reference to Mr. Hirota’s statement in the Diet under date
                                January 25. There is enclosed a translation of the pertinent portion
                                of that statement as telegraphed to the Department.<note n="32"
                                    xml:id="d96fn32">See telegram No. 80, February 6, 3 p.m., <ref
                                        target="#pg_72">p. 72</ref>.</note> It will be observed that
                                the remark quoted in the Resolution does not occur in the statement
                                and the Department has no information indicating that Mr. Hirota
                                made such a remark. The comment may be made in this connection that
                                replies to interpellations in the Diet generally consist of
                                impromptu remarks which are at times characterized by ambiguity
                                which while often passing unnoticed in a language as vague and
                                impersonal as the Japanese language may be lacking in clarity and be
                                subject to misconstruction when translated into English. However, it
                                would appear to be clear from the statement of Mr. Hirota that Japan
                                has not declared war upon China and that Mr. Hirota does not
                                consider that a <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> state of war exists
                                between the two countries. In this connection <pb n="86"
                                    xml:id="pg_86" facs="0090"/>attention is invited to his
                                statement that “In the light of the situation in China and in
                                international relations we have not yet taken the step of declaring
                                war”.</p>
                            <p>With regard to section (4) of H. Res. 418, there must be taken into
                                account, in deciding whether the President should be advised in
                                regard to the invocation of the Joint Resolution approved May 1,
                                    1937,<note n="33" xml:id="d96fn33">50 Stat. 121.</note> commonly
                                referred to as the Neutrality Act, various factors—and especially
                                the broad, general interest of this country and its nationals. In
                                the present situation in the Far East, the President has been of the
                                opinion that, in the light of all of the facts and circumstances,
                                and with due and conscientious consideration of both the letter and
                                the spirit of the neutrality legislation, the intent of that

                                course of our conversation on February 8, I stated that I would
                                furnish you with information within a few days in response to your
                                inquiries with regard to the reduction and redistribution of
                                American armed forces in north China and with regard to the Chinese
                                customs question.</p>
                            <p>On January 31 Mr. Hornbeck made an oral statement to Mr. Lucet of
                                your Embassy in regard to our decision to withdraw the Fifteenth
                                Regiment, United States Army, from Tientsin, and to transfer to
                                Tientsin a portion of the American marines now stationed at
                                Peiping.</p>
                            <p>The matter of effecting a reduction and redistribution of American
                                armed forces in north China is one to which we had been giving
                                consideration for some time before the fighting broke out in north
                                China last July. The change that is now about to take place is what
                                might have occurred earlier had not the conflict arisen between
                                China and Japan. Our decision now to reduce and redistribute our
                                troops in north China does not involve modification of our treaty
                                position in north China. We are continuing to maintain armed forces
                                in both Peiping and Tientsin in accordance with our rights and
                                responsibilities under the Boxer Protocol of 1901.<note n="34"

                                views of the French Government in regard to the desirability of
                                maintaining diplomatic representation and embassy guards in north
                                China and of the decision of the British Government not to withdraw
                                for the present its diplomatic staff and guards from Peiping and
                                Tientsin. The British Government expressed the hope that the French,
                                British, and American Governments would concert together before
                                taking any action in the matter. We replied that we would be pleased
                                to maintain close touch with the French Government, as well as with
                                the British Government, but that we felt that this expression of
                                attitude should be regarded as relating to exchange of information
                                and consultation rather than as constituting an agreement to act or
                                to refrain from action in concert.</p>

                            <p>In an interview with the Counsellor of His Majesty’s Embassy on the
                                21st January Mr. Hamilton expressed the readiness of the Department
                                of State to receive any suggestions which His Majesty’s Government
                                in the United Kingdom might have to offer with regard to the
                                question of calls to be paid on the representatives of the
                                Provisional Government at Peking and on territorial officials. The
                                following information on this subject has now been received from the
                                Foreign Office.</p>
                            <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0092"/>
                            <p>As regards diplomatic representatives His Majesty’s Government feel
                                that, even if visitors are received on a personal footing, more
                                formal arrangements may be made to receive return visits; while for
                                them to receive territorial appointees such as the Mayor of Tientsin
                                and not to receive actual members of the new Provisional Government
                                at Peking might cause extreme ill-feeling. Moreover the expedient of
                                returning calls by sending a card even by the hand of a personal
                                representative would seem rude if done more than once or twice and
                                is therefore, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government,
                                undesirable as a general procedure.</p>
                            <p>In view of these objections His Majesty’s Chargé d’Affaires is being
                                instructed to the effect that the exchange of visits on a personal
                                and informal basis should be restricted to consular officers; as, in
                                any case, representations to the Provisional Government would have
                                to be conducted through a consular officer in view of the
                                nonrecognition of that Government, this procedure would not seem
                                likely to affect the protection of British interests all the more
                                because these representations would in most cases be addressed
                                through the Japanese Embassy. In point of fact there is reason to
                                believe that members of the Provisional Government are aware of the
                                awkwardness of the situation and that the likelihood of their
                                wishing to exchange calls with foreign missions is at present
                                remote.</p>
                            <p>As regards invitations to functions, His Majesty’s Government
                                consider they should as a general rule be refused; but in special
                                circumstances and where other missions favour similar action there
                                might be no objection to consular officers attending.</p>
                            <p>In this connection His Majesty’s Government appreciate that the
                                United States Embassy staff at Peking are all Foreign Service
                                officers holding diplomatic rank, so that it would no doubt in
                                practice be impossible for the United States Government to draw the
                                same distinction as they do. His Majesty’s Government however
                                venture to hope that the United States Government will see their way
                                to instruct their diplomatic representative at Peking to adopt a
                                more or less identical procedure, for example on the lines that
                                calls limited as above should be received and returned by
                                subordinate officers and not by the diplomatic representative in
                                charge of the mission.</p>
                            <p>His Majesty’s Government are approaching the French Government in a
                                similar sense.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Hornbeck</hi>: In Brussels, you and
                                Norman Davis suggested that we should try to work out an outline of
                                a decent settlement of the Far Eastern situation. At the time, I was
                                inclined to think that this was a work of supererogation. But we
                                have been thinking it over, and have now produced an essay on the
                                subject, which I should like you to see. I therefore enclose it, for
                                your personal information, and in the hope that, on the same purely
                                personal basis, you may give us your perfectly frank opinion and any
                                suggestions that you can think of.</p>
                            <p>I should explain that this memorandum sets out the kind of settlement
                                which we in the Foreign Office would consider reasonable, and which
                                we should like to bring about if we had a perfectly free hand to lay
                                down the lines of a settlement. Which we have not—as yet! It has not
                                been considered by the Government and must not be taken as
                                committing them. The Japanese will of course want far more, and
                                unless a great and unforeseen change of mood occurs in Japan, we
                                cannot expect to see a settlement on the lines sketched, unless our
                                two Governments were able to exercise effective pressure to secure
                                it. On the other hand, if the Japanese were once brought to accept
                                it, the advantages it would offer them might be sufficient to
                                produce a stable situation not requiring to be maintained by
                                sustained pressure of a kind beyond our ordinary capacity.</p>

                                    could effectively be brought to bear in the direction of
                                    restoring peace would be by action taken in defence of purely
                                    British interests. So far such action has been limited to
                                    representations to the Japanese Government and to various
                                    Japanese military and civil officials in China. These
                                    representations have not been entirely ineffective but action on
                                    these lines seems unlikely to cause Japan to abandon her present
                                    intention of destroying the Chinese Government and setting up in
                                    place thereof one or more puppet Governments or Administrations
                                    that would be completely subservient to the will of Japan. Under
                                    such a settlement it seems clear that all foreign interests
                                    would suffer serious injury and might indeed in the course of
                                    time find themselves excluded from China, as they have already
                                    to a large extent been excluded from Korea and Manchuria. If,
                                    however, representations were backed by naval forces adequate to
                                    defend any vital British interest that might be threatened it
                                    seems probable that the attitude of the Japanese Government
                                    towards China would be considerably modified. The question of
                                    possible peace terms has therefore been considered from this
                                    angle: on the assumption that His Majesty’s Government are in a
                                    position to enforce respect for vital British interests and thus
                                    dictate terms of peace, what should these terms be? <list>

                                            and stable political conditions, (2) the open door and
                                            equality of opportunity, (3) the security of Hong Kong.
                                            No. (3) might conceivably be obtained independently of
                                            Nos. (1) and (2), but it is clear that if Nos. (1) and
                                            (2) were obtained it would not be necessary for His

                                            ensure the security of Hong Kong. Consequently, if His
                                            Majesty’s Government were able to secure a peace of a
                                            stable nature and based upon the principles of the open
                                            door and equality of opportunity every vital British
                                            interest would thereby be fully safeguarded and they
                                            might hope to secure the co-operation of other Powers
                                            having substantial interests in the Far East in the

                                            hope that the United States Government will also find
                                            that all that is necessary for the protection of
                                            American interests in the Orient is the due observance
                                            by all parties of the Nine Power Treaty, and would
                                            therefore be disposed to take action parallel to that of
                                            His Majesty’s Government. Such action might consist in
                                            representing to Japan that American (British) interests
                                            are suffering damage through the failure of Japan to
                                            observe the terms of Article 1 of the Nine Power Treaty
                                            and in taking such measures as will make it evident that

                                            Japan, however, has 20,000 nationals residing in
                                            Shanghai and a considerable share in the vested
                                            interests and foreign trade. As it is essential to avoid
                                            arrangements that would be either unfair or humiliating
                                            to Japan it would be necessary to allow Japan to take
                                            measures for the protection of her nationals and her
                                            interests, and to accord her a share in the control of
                                            the foreign administered area corresponding to the
                                            numbers of the Japanese population and the importance of
                                            Japanese trade and vested interests. The administration,
                                            and more particularly the police force, would thus
                                            become to a large and increasing extent, Japanese in
                                            character. This would lead to friction with the Chinese,
                                            and eventually almost certainly armed clashes and a
                                            recurrence of the disastrous events of 1932 and

                                        <item>It is moreover difficult to reconcile the foreign
                                            administration of Shanghai with the provisions of the
                                            Nine Power Treaty. Shanghai is the sixth largest city in
                                            the world. In finance, commerce, shipping and industry
                                            it is the heart of China and it may be argued with some
                                            force that China can hardly develop the effective and
                                            suitable Government contemplated in the Nine Power
                                            Treaty so long as Chinese authority is in any degree
                                            excluded from Shanghai. Company legislation, insurance
                                            laws, control of education and relations between
                                            employers and employees, protection of labour, housing,
                                            protection and development of manufactures, control of
                                            key industries, economic planning generally—all these
                                            are essential elements in the social and economic
                                            structure of a modern state. But in the case of China
                                            that structure is distorted because nearly one half the
                                            population of Shanghai resides in areas from which
                                            Chinese authority is excluded. The traditional aim of
                                            American and British policy, enshrined in the Nine Power
                                            Treaty, has been to encourage China to develop into a
                                            modern state. But this aim has been to a large extent
                                            frustrated by inability to break away from the older
                                            tradition of imposing tutelage and protecting foreign
                                            interests by armed force. Important as the foreign
                                            interests concentrated in Shanghai may be, it is
                                            doubtful whether security can in fact be obtained for
                                            them in future by the old methods of foreign
                                            administered areas and foreign garrisons. It is
                                            improbable that the Chinese will accept a situation in
                                            which one half the population of their greatest city is

                                            which will persist if Japanese control is not eliminated
                                            from Shanghai and the impediment to the normal
                                            development of China which foreign control generally in
                                            Shanghai will constitute, there would seem to be much to
                                            be said for a radical change in the existing conditions
                                            in Shanghai. A solution that would be both in harmony
                                            with the Nine Power Treaty and not humiliating to Japan
                                            can only be found by means of a self-denying ordinance
                                            under which whatever Japan is asked to surrender other
                                            Powers would also surrender, even though this might
                                            involve abandoning safeguards which have hitherto been
                                            regarded as indispensable for the protection of foreign
                                            interests at Shanghai. The only alternative to
                                            maintaining the International Settlement by force is to
                                            surrender all foreign control and restore complete
                                            Chinese control. The rendition of the International
                                            Settlement need not mean the end of foreign
                                            participation in local municipal government. It is
                                            suggested that on the withdrawal of the Japanese troops
                                            from Shanghai the Governments of the United States of
                                            America and the United Kingdom should each use their
                                            influence to secure that one municipal authority should
                                            be set up by the Chinese Government for the whole of
                                            Greater Shanghai, including Pootung, the International
                                            Settlement, the external Roads area, and, if possible,
                                            the French Concession. The existing municipal
                                            administration of the Settlement would be merged in the
                                            larger body which, while remaining a Chinese authority,
                                            would contain a foreign element with full representation
                                            of Japanese, British and other foreign interests. There
                                            would be one police force—also containing a foreign
                                            element—and Chinese laws would be applied and the
                                            Chinese writ would run throughout Shanghai. No troops,
                                            Chinese or foreign, would be stationed within a radius
                                            of, say, 30 miles round Shanghai, thus giving effect to
                                            one of the desiderata to which the Japanese have always
                                            attached great importance.</item>

                                            would facilitate a settlement on the other points at
                                            issue on the basis of the open door and equality of
                                            opportunity, and in the spirit of the Nine Power Treaty
                                            which should obviously connote the withdrawal of
                                            Japanese armed forces from China and probably the
                                            withdrawal of all foreign garrisons. The Chinese would
                                            doubtless be willing to give assurances that the
                                            Maritime Customs Administration would be maintained on a
                                            basis of international co-operation fair to all powers
                                            trading <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0097"/>in the
                                            Far East. She might also be pressed to give satisfaction
                                            to Japan on a number of points to which the Japanese
                                            Government legitimately attach great importance, such as
                                            anti-Japanese teaching in school text books, the
                                            suppression of anti-Japanese propaganda, the tariff
                                            rates to be applied to Japanese trade, etc. Japan
                                            attaches very great importance to her special position
                                            in North China. The terms of peace might therefore also
                                            include the recognition of Manchukuo by China—a measure
                                            which would remove one of the irritants that tend to
                                            disturb international relations generally—and the grant
                                            of special facilities for economic co-operation and the
                                            investment of Japanese capital in North China. This
                                            might include mining and industrial concessions for
                                            Japanese corporations, and some measure of Japanese
                                            participation in the management of the Northern
                                            Railways. Finally if, in the course of the general
                                            settlement, an opportunity should occur for dealing with
                                            the question of extraterritoriality, His Majesty’s
                                            Government would favour a solution on the lines of the
                                            draft agreement of 1931<note n="41" xml:id="d99fn41">For

                            <p>259. Since February 12 the Japanese each day have been despatching
                                small patrols consisting of from 2 to 12 soldiers in charge of a
                                junior or noncommissioned officer into the International Settlement
                                area south of Soochow Creek. These patrols march up Nanking Road,
                                circumvent Thibet Road, and by Peiping Road to the Bund and back to
                                Hongkew.</p>
                            <p>I am informed by the intelligence officer of the 4th Marines that
                                according to the Shanghai municipal police the Japanese did not
                                notify them of their intention to despatch such patrols into the
                                Settlement and that upon bringing the matter to the attention of the
                                Japanese military authorities the police were informed that the
                                Japanese were merely exercising the same right as is enjoyed by the
                                other foreign defense forces of sending out patrols to protect their
                                respective military details. In the area south of Soochow Creek
                                Japanese details consist of an occasional Japanese military truck,
                                despatch rider or staff car.</p>
                            <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0098"/>
                            <p>On three occasions these patrols upon reaching the junction of
                                Bubbling Well Road and Thibet Road have sought to march up Bubbling
                                Well Road which is within the American defense sector. In each
                                instance they have been courteously turned back by the United States
                                Marines on duty at this point.</p>
                            <p>No serious incidents have occurred thus far but it would not be
                                surprising if Chinese special service agents or terrorists attempted
                                to bomb these patrols whose presence south of Soochow Creek is
                                extremely provocative.</p>
                            <p>Repeated to Hankow and Peiping.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that Mr. A.
                                T. Steele, representative in North China of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Chicago Daily News</hi>, recently called at the Consulate
                                General and reported an interesting conversation he had had the
                                previous day in Hsinking with Major General Kanji Ishihara, Vice
                                Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. In commenting upon the reports
                                of the looting by Japanese troops in Nanking after the taking of the
                                capital, General Ishihara stated emphatically that if the reports
                                were true, General Matsui was completely responsible for the troops’
                                behavior. He said that the morale of the Japanese Army had never
                                been at a lower level than it was at the present time. He deprecated
                                the current lack of discipline among Japanese troops.</p>
                            <p>In the course of their conversation he also informed Mr. Steele that
                                the Japanese would not open hostilities against Soviet Russia and
                                that he believed Russia would not make the first attack against
                                Japan unless it was assured of Great Britain’s support. He said that
                                it therefore meant that Japan would not fight Russia unless it had
                                to fight Great Britain as well.</p>
                            <p>In this connection it seems worth mentioning that Mr. Richard T.
                                Evans, a prominent American attorney from Tientsin who called this
                                morning on Major General Sueichiro Higuchi, chief of the Japanese
                                Military Mission in Harbin, was likewise informed by General Higuchi
                                that Japan would not take the initiative in bringing about a
                                conflict with Soviet Russia. When Mr. Evans remarked to the General
                                that he had been under the impression that, whereas the responsible
                                authorities in Japan and perhaps the highest officers in command <pb
                                    n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0099"/>of the Japanese Army, were
                                opposed to opening hostilities with Soviet Russia, such was not the
                                case with a comprehensive group of younger officers who advocated
                                attacking Russia at this time while there was an enthusiasm for
                                military conquest among the public in Japan which it would be
                                difficult to rouse again when it had once been allowed to subside.
                                General Higuchi agreed that there had been such a conviction on the
                                part of the younger officers, that he had been one of them, and had
                                shared their conviction, but that he had now changed his mind and
                                was firm in the belief that it was wiser for Japan to show restraint
                                vis-à-vis Soviet Russia.</p>
                            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Harbin Nichi Nichi</hi> of February 16
                                published a report that Manchurian troops guarding the third tunnel
                                of the railroad near Pogranichnaya were attacked on February 14 by
                                15 Soviet soldiers with scouting dogs who had invaded “Manchukuo”
                                territory by about 150 meters. The invaders were repulsed
                                immediately with fire, and it was considered unlikely that the
                                incident would lead to further trouble; the government at Hsinking
                                had, however, considered it serious enough to make a strong protest
                                to the Soviet Consulate General in Harbin.</p>
                            <p>From Harbin Mr. Steele, armed with proper Japanese credentials, went
                                by rail to the strongly fortified town of Taheiho directly across
                                the Amur River from Blagoveshchensk. Upon his return he informed the
                                Consulate General that he had seen nothing of particular interest
                                either from a military or a political standpoint, and that he did
                                not believe the 2½ days’ journey had been worth making.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                                informed by intelligence officer of the 4th Marines that Lieutenant
                                Colonel Oka of the Japanese Military Attaché’s office called this
                                morning at Marine Headquarters and apologized for attempts made by
                                Japanese patrols to enter the American defense sector. He said that
                                these attempts had been made due to ignorance and added that
                                instructions had now been issued to all patrols to refrain from
                                entering the defense sector. Colonel Oka inquired regarding the
                                possibility of Japanese patrols entering some sections of the
                                American sector by mutual arrangement but was informed by Colonel

                            <p>61. I am pleased to be able to report that within the past 10 days
                                there have been a noticeable improvement in conditions in Nanking.
                                Most of the Chinese are returning from the so-called “safety zone”
                                to former homes in other parts of the city. While reports still come
                                in from time to time of disorder and unlawful acts of Japanese
                                soldiers, the number of such reports has materially decreased and
                                there is definite evidence that the Japanese authorities are making
                                efforts to better the present living conditions of the local
                                population. Restrictions on movements of foreigners are gradually
                                being loosened, and permission has recently been obtained for the
                                return to Nanking of an American doctor whose presence is urgently
                                needed at the Nanking University Hospital, an American
                                institution.</p>

                                        pp. 1</ref> ff.</note> when the Japanese nation became more
                                and more convinced that the country had been sold out to the other
                                naval powers, the Japanese Navy has laid down a policy which has
                                been consistently followed and which <hi rend="italic">nolens
                                    volens</hi> must be recognized by the Powers as the basis for
                                any Japanese approach to the question of naval disarmament. This
                                policy is one of independent naval construction of a nature designed
                                to meet what the Japanese Navy considers to be its needs: (1) to
                                provide impregnable defense for the Empire and (2) to implement its
                                policy of dominating East Asia and of the “southward advance”. This
                                is described by the Japanese as defensive and, if we exclude the
                                “southward advance” and admit the preponderance of Japanese
                                interests on the mainland of East Asia, it can be accepted as such.
                                There is no evidence that their present Navy or their future
                                building program are of such a nature as to constitute a threat to
                                any country beyond the sphere roughly known as East Asia. This
                                policy of independent naval construction has found expression in
                                three phrases well-known to the Powers which have had dealings with
                                Japan in naval matters for the past few years. These phrases, which
                                first appeared early in 1935, some six or eight months prior to
                                Japan’s abrogation of the Washington and London Naval Treaties, have
                                been used on every outstanding occasion; upon their notice of

                                information concerning naval construction. These phrases are (1)
                                “common upper limit” (2) “no qualitative without quantitative

                                by the other Powers.</p>
                            <p>Of these three phrases the first is self-explanatory, but may be
                                expressed in another form as an insistence upon parity in tonnage in
                                principle; the second merely means that without quantitative
                                limitation, i. e., acceptance by all of a common upper limit,
                                qualitative limitation will not, in Japanese eyes, serve the
                                purposes of realistic disarmament; the third is an expression of the
                                defensive policy of construction which the Japanese maintain they
                                are pursuing. And they are so convinced of their inherent right to
                                the domination of the territory adjacent to their Empire that they
                                are sincere in their characterization of their naval policy as
                                defensive.</p>
                            <p>There immediately comes to mind the question as to whether it is
                                possible to reconcile the Japanese views of defensive naval
                                construction and of non-menace and non-aggression with the fact, if
                                true, of their building battleships and cruisers of a tonnage in
                                excess of those now possessed by Great Britain and the United
                                States. This question is capable of being approached along the
                                following lines: In the first place the construction by Japan of
                                vessels in excess of 40,000 tons would immediately stimulate the
                                United States and Great Britain to respond in kind which, in fact,
                                it appears that they are about to do; therefore the possibility of
                                aggressive action by Japan against a country as far distant as, say,
                                the United States, would in no way be increased. In the second place
                                it is generally believed by technical observers that the new
                                vessels, while more heavily armed than their present ships, will
                                probably have little increased cruising radius and that, therefore,
                                they can be regarded as defensive in character, at least in the view
                                of the Japanese.</p>
                            <p>As to the policy of “southward advance”, it is generally conceded
                                that mere ship construction cannot further the pursuit of this
                                policy—which it is admitted must be regarded as aggressive—unless
                                and until the Japanese construct new naval bases further southward
                                than Formosa, and there is no evidence as yet that they intend to do
                                so.</p>
                            <p>To sum up the foregoing, therefore, it can be stated that the present
                                Japanese naval policy is one which actually does and will continue
                                to constitute a threat to the interests of the western Powers in
                                East Asia, but which does not, and probably will not in the
                                immediate future, constitute a threat to the territory of the
                                western Powers themselves. This, we repeat, is what the Japanese
                                believe to be the pursuit of a defensive policy.</p>
                            <p>II. The reasons underlying this policy have been frequently touched
                                upon in despatches from this Embassy. They can be summed up as
                                follows: (1) It has been abundantly clear to the Japanese that with
                                the relatively meagre resources at their command they could <pb
                                    n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0103"/>never hope to compete
                                successfully in a ship-for-ship construction race with greater and
                                richer Powers; this is both obvious and axiomatic but nevertheless
                                it should not be left unstated. (2) Japan feels that she can neither
                                feed her population nor continue to exist in the industrial world
                                without gaining access to such raw materials as may be within her
                                grasp or without stabilizing and increasing her markets in China;
                                consequently the control of China and the approaches to it render
                                domination of East Asia, in the minds of the Japanese, an absolute
                                necessity. (3) The existence of the League of Nations with its
                                constant threat of the use of economic sanctions brings unceasing
                                pressure to bear upon Japan to take such steps as she deems
                                necessary to defend herself against the possible consequences of the
                                application of such sanctions. (4) Her geographical location makes
                                it possible for her to make her defense, from a naval point of view,
                                nearly impregnable provided that she be free to build unrestrictedly
                                the types of ships which suit her needs. (5) Her passionate desire
                                for equality in the eyes of the world and for the preservation of
                                her <hi rend="italic">amour propre</hi>, as well as her necessity
                                for maintaining “face” in the eyes of the Chinese, has led her to
                                hold out for parity in principle even at the cost of stimulating
                                further construction on the part of the other naval Powers. For
                                example, if Japan’s policy results in the building by the United
                                States of a navy so large that the ratio between it and that of
                                Japan is increased to an extent even beyond the present ratio,
                                Japan’s defensive position, i. e., not only as regards the Empire
                                itself but as regards its domination of East Asia, will be scarcely
                                affected—a fact which concerns Japan greatly—whereas Japan’s
                                offensive position, i. e., her ability to attack the United States
                                will be, of course, greatly reduced—a fact which concerns Japan
                                virtually not at all.</p>
                            <p>Without intending to make an exhaustive study of the motives behind
                                Japanese naval policy, the foregoing are among the outstanding
                                factors which must be taken into consideration in evaluating that
                                policy. It may well be argued from the above that the Japanese have
                                much to gain and little to lose by pursuing a policy of independent
                                naval construction and permitting the other nations to do what they
                                like. Japan has no present intention of carrying the battle to the
                                western Powers; but if the western Powers wish to carry the battle
                                to Japan, the Japanese navy is and can be prepared.</p>
                            <p>III. The effect upon the Japanese Government and public opinion of
                                the recent inquiry addressed to Japan by the three Powers, in which
                                information was requested as to whether Japan were building ships in
                                excess of the treaty tonnage, has been, to judge by the tone of the
                                Government’s reply, and the press comment, to arouse a feeling of
                                resentment that the treaty Powers should call upon Japan to furnish
                                information not required by any obligation incumbent upon her. At
                                    <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0104"/>the same time, however,
                                the Japanese Government placed itself on record once more as being
                                willing to enter upon discussions on the matter of disarmament
                                “which give primary importance to a fair quantitative
                                limitation”.</p>
                            <p>From the point of view of the press here the action of the three
                                Powers was designed to throw the burden of naval armament expansion
                                upon Japan in the eyes of the world and for no other reason. The
                                press argues that as common sense will show that Japan’s budget will
                                not permit the building of a fleet large enough to menace the United
                                States, why, then, does the American press maintain that the
                                Japanese reply will make Japan responsible for beginning a naval
                                armament race? “The real intention of Great Britain, France and the
                                United States,” says the <hi rend="italic">Nichi Nichi Shimbun</hi>,
                                “is to shift to Japan the burden of responsibility for their
                                respective armament expansion. The primary intention of Great
                                Britain is to protect its rights and interests in China by indirect
                                means.” And so on; there is no need to quote further from the press.
                                The fact remains that the action of the three Powers was resented
                                and that the Japanese are apparently indifferent to the prospect
                                that a naval race may be started by their refusal to furnish
                                information concerning their naval construction.</p>
                            <p>IV. It may at this point be desirable to speculate upon the reasons
                                underlying the refusal of Japan to furnish information regarding her
                                naval building in order to prevent the Powers from exercising their
                                rights under the “escalator” clause of the 1936 Treaty and so
                                stimulating a naval armament race. The reasons which come to mind
                                are three: <list>
                                    <label>(1)</label>
                                    <item>The Japanese are convinced that, due to world conditions
                                        elsewhere than in the Far East, Great Britain (followed by
                                        the United States) would in any case greatly increase her
                                        strength in categories of vessels which, even though they
                                        might remain within treaty limits, as to tonnage, would make
                                        it necessary for Japan to build further for defense; hence
                                        Japan would rather be left free to construct as she pleases;
                                        and not to tie herself down to ships of a specified
                                        tonnage.</item>
                                    <label>(2)</label>
                                    <item>Japan is fully aware of her “nuisance value” and she is
                                        hopeful that, with her ability to maintain secrecy regarding
                                        her naval construction to a far greater degree than any
                                        other nation, she is in a position—by creating fear that she
                                        is building new types of vessels which would render obsolete
                                        existing types—to be such a constant menace to the Powers
                                        that she may force them eventually to accept the principle
                                        of parity in exchange for information regarding her naval
                                        construction.</item>
                                    <label>(3)</label>
                                    <item>And lastly, the Japanese feel that they can afford to be
                                        more or less indifferent to the expansion of naval armaments
                                        by the Powers for the reasons given under II above; namely,
                                        that Japan is confident of her ability to take care of her
                                        security in East Asia irrespective of what the Powers may
                                        do.</item>
                                </list></p>

                            <p>There are enclosed herewith copies of the American, British and
                                French notes of February 5, 1938, and of the Japanese replies

                                French translation. It may be added in this connection that while we
                                are transmitting to the Department our reply in English translation
                                exactly as it was received from the Foreign Office, the British
                                Embassy chose to “polish up” the translation which they received
                                before transmitting it to London. A comparison of the two texts will
                                reveal that the British Embassy version of the translation conveys a
                                rather more brusque tone than does the original as received by this

                            <p>117. The following memorandum was submitted to me today by the
                                Military Attaché:<note n="50" xml:id="d105fn50">Col. Joseph W.
                                    Stilwell.</note>

                                    <p>“With reference to the statement by the War Minister in this
                                        morning’s papers concerning the ‘replacement’ of units in
                                        China, the ‘strengthening of the fighting power of the
                                        Japanese Expeditionary Army’ et cetera, a visit to the War
                                        Office for the purpose of clarifying the above statement has
                                        brought forth the following information:</p>
                                    <p>That the moves contemplated do not necessarily mean either a
                                        strengthening or a weakening of the forces in China from a
                                        numerical standpoint but rather a reorganization and
                                        redistribution with a view to a strengthening of the
                                        Japanese forces organically and strategically for the more
                                        or less prolonged condition of hostilities which the
                                        Japanese High Command now feel lies before them, and that
                                        while the moves to this end may well involve the replacement
                                        of certain units, it is likely that the units replaced will
                                        be those not necessary in the type of operation which they
                                        visualize for the future.</p>
                                    <p>When questioned as to whether this statement by the War
                                        Minister implied any change in the objectives of the
                                        Japanese Army, the officer to whom I spoke stated with
                                        considerable emphasis that their objectives remained the
                                        same, i. e., the destruction of the Chinese forces opposing
                                        them and the anti-Japanese communistic influences in China
                                        and he added that the big question at present lies in the
                                        decision as to the manner by which these ends may best be
                                        achieved”.</p>

                                        <ref target="#pg_87">p. 87</ref>.</note> transmitting
                                information from the British Foreign Office on the subject of calls
                                on representatives of the provisional government at Peiping and on
                                territorial officials. In summary, it is stated that the British
                                Embassy, Peiping, is being instructed to the effect that the
                                exchange of visits on a personal and informal basis should be
                                restricted to consular officers; that as representations to the
                                provisional government would in view of the non-recognition of that
                                government have to be conducted through a consular officer, this
                                procedure would not seem likely to affect the protection of British
                                interests more particularly because representations would in most
                                cases be made through the Japanese Embassy.</p>
                            <p>With regard to invitations to functions, the British Government
                                considers that they should as a general rule be refused, but in
                                special circumstances and where other missions favor similar action,
                                there might be no objection to consular officers attending. In
                                conclusion, it is stated that the British Government appreciates
                                that as all the officers of our Embassy staff hold diplomatic rank
                                it would not be practicable to draw the same distinction as the
                                British do, but the hope is expressed that this Government will see
                                its way to instruct its Embassy to adopt a procedure more or less
                                identical, e. g., that calls limited as above be received and
                                returned by subordinate officers and not by the senior diplomatic
                                officer. A similar approach, it is added, is also being made to the
                                French Government.</p>
                            <p>Keeping in mind the basic principle involved, as set forth in the
                                Department’s instruction under reference, to the effect that there
                                should be avoided action or attitude that might be construed as
                                carrying any degree of official recognition of the new régime, and
                                in view of the desirability of the principally interested
                                Governments following procedures more or less identical in regard to
                                matters of protocol, the Department suggests that you consult with
                                your British and French colleagues with regard to the British
                                proposal outlined above and give the Department the benefit of your
                                views and suggestions.</p>

                                <item>I believe that a distinction should be drawn between officials
                                    of the “Provisional Government” and municipal officials serving
                                    thereunder. It seems to me that the proposal made by the British
                                    Government could probably be applied to municipal officers as
                                    distinguished from Provisional Government officials with the
                                    exception that in the case of this Embassy it might be necessary
                                    on occasions to substitute a subordinate diplomatic officer for
                                    a consular officer, depending somewhat on the circumstances of
                                    the call from the local official. There is one career consular
                                    officer attached to the Embassy at present. As regards officials
                                    of the so-called “Provisional Government” it would seem to be
                                    preferable to adhere to the procedure defined in the
                                    Department’s 400, December 15, 7 p.m.,<note n="53"

                                    is to say, calls received from such officials should be
                                    acknowledged by sending, or if deemed definitely expedient,
                                    taking in return the personal card of the officer in charge with
                                    the personal name of the official called upon written thereon. I
                                    received a call from the Mayor recently and returned it on this
                                    basis.</item>

                                    difficult problem, but there is reason to believe that this
                                    question will not arise at least until after the appointment of

                                <item>It will be difficult for the Embassy to escape the necessity
                                    of informal representations to the local authorities, (generally
                                    to the municipal authorities by subordinate officers) from time
                                    to time, on subjects such as local taxes, municipal regulations,
                                    and protection. So far there has been no occasion to approach

                                    presented me with his estimate of the considerations entering
                                    into the decision to replace General Matsui, as follows: <quote
                                        rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>“(1) (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The widespread feeling in
                                            Japanese Army circles that operations in China are
                                            likely to be more or less protracted and that the army
                                            forces in China are being reorganized accordingly.</p>
                                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) That General Matsui is about
                                            60 years old and was on the retired list before being
                                            called to active service in the Shanghai area.</p>
                                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) That General Matsui is a man
                                            of strong political ideas and less amenable to control
                                            by a central authority than would be an officer of a
                                            more conservative type.</p>
                                        <p>(2) To what extent each of the above considerations
                                            entered into the decision is impossible to determine
                                            though it is felt that the one relating to politics has
                                            played a greater part than the Japanese with whom this
                                            matter was discussed were willing to admit. However, the
                                            operations in China are now in course of transition from
                                            a very active military phase to a phase in which, while
                                            military operations will still be carried out, more
                                            politico-military in character, and in which the
                                            Japanese efforts in China are directed toward a
                                            political as well as a military stabilization. Under
                                            such circumstances and with the above mentioned
                                            reorganization for a long haul in view it appears quite
                                            natural that central authority both in and out of the
                                            army should lean toward a commander whose actions may be
                                            expected to be in greater harmony with both a political
                                            and a military stabilization policy.</p>
                                        <p>(3) The relief does not imply any censure of General
                                            Matsui in the military or popular mind. After all he is
                                            a commander who has succeeded and it is not unlikely
                                            that his return to Japan will be accompanied by acclaim
                                            for a work well done.</p>
                                        <p>(4) In the sense that the change of command may indicate
                                            a change of policy in China the following remarks
                                            concerning the two men will indicate their respective
                                            backgrounds. <list>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that Mr. G.
                                Cora, Italian Ambassador to China, is at present spending a few days
                                in Hong Kong. His arrival here coincided with that of Sir Archibald
                                Clark Kerr, the new British Ambassador to China, who stopped in Hong
                                Kong three days en route from Europe to Shanghai.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Cora was my colleague in Addis Ababa and we are somewhat
                                intimately acquainted. In the course of a general conversation which
                                I had today with him he remarked that he had in effect advised
                                General Chiang Kai-shek, on the occasion of their last meeting, to
                                get together with the Japanese and thus save what he could for
                                China; that the battle was inevitably a losing one (just as was that
                                of Haile Selassie against the Italians in Ethiopia!) and the longer
                                it went on the less China would have at the end. Cora further
                                remarked to me that he couldn’t see why the Chinese continued to
                                resist; that they must have some one to help develop their country,
                                and why not have the Japanese who were so well situated and equipped
                                for the purpose.</p>
                            <p>These particular comments of Mr. Cora are repeated because I am
                                impressed that they represent, although he did not specifically so
                                state, thoughts inspired by his official instructions from Rome. The
                                Italian Ambassador is leaving Hong Kong on February 25th, 1938, to
                                return to Shanghai.</p>
                            <p>Very respectfully,</p>

                                <item>Craigie has recommended to his Government that the terms of
                                    the Japanese undertaking to refrain from attacking the safety
                                    zone be communicated to the Chinese Government. He believes that
                                    “if we fail to pass on to the Chinese authorities the Japanese
                                    proposals in respect of a safety zone, we not only discourage
                                    the Japanese from making conciliatory suggestions in future but
                                    give them a pretext for maintaining the powers have failed to

                                <item>In his letter to me Craigie refers to the Japanese undertaking
                                    as an “offer” and apparently assumes that an explicit engagement
                                    by the Chinese Government to fulfill the Japanese conditions is
                                    necessary before the Japanese undertaking become binding on the
                                    Japanese Government. The Japanese note to us of January 11
                                    reported in our January 13, 4 p.m. via Shanghai does not so
                                    indicate. The question whether or not our Government should make
                                    representations to the Chinese Government in the matter is one
                                    which the Department may wish to decide in consultation with
                                    Johnson.</item>

                                calmly. They are probably more interested in continued purchase of
                                German military supplies and service of military advisers. I think
                                German attitude was expected. It is my opinion that it does not

                                regard to Japanese who were already embarked upon military conquest
                                of China for the purpose of destroying the Chinese nationalism
                                founded on occidental democratic and capitalistic rather than
                                communistic lines. Soviet Russia will not attack Japan but may be
                                expected to aid China to prolong campaign, content with the hope
                                that Japan will exhaust itself in China. A Germany involved with
                                Soviet Russia can hope for little assistance from a Japan

                                endeavored to limit action to notifying Japanese military of foreign
                                property, shippers and nationals, and asking for assurances against

                                to Chinese authorities locally stating that Japanese had given
                                assurances not to attack such places as were not utilized by Chinese
                                troops for military purposes, and requesting Chinese to remove from
                                area any military works or any troops that might be stationed
                                therein. Chinese replied stating that no anti-aircraft batteries had
                                been placed within municipal area. It is obviously impossible for us
                                to obtain from Chinese any undertaking upon which we can depend as
                                to what situation may be should fighting actually occur in the
                                vicinity of Hankow. Craigie’s note to Grew may arise from the fact
                                that British are now trying to return to basis upon which my
                                original proposal was made and to line which I have consistently
                                followed, and from the feeling that original British communication
                                does not permit this.</p>

                                    >Head of the Japanese-sponsored régime in Peiping.</note> and
                                with the knowledge and acquiescence of the military authorities, Dr.
                                Leighton Stuart<note n="75" xml:id="d113fn75">American, president of
                                    Yenching University, Peiping.</note> left Peiping yesterday via
                                Shanghai for Hankow for the express purpose of seeking audience of
                                Chiang Kai Shek on the subject of possible peace negotiations. On
                                asking Dr. Stuart on what basis the Japanese would be willing to
                                negotiate he said: (1) Suppression of anti-Japanese movements; (2)
                                establishment of a good administrative area in North China (which I
                                interpret to mean an independent government in the north such as now
                                exists); (3) economic cooperation and (4) reparation. I remarked
                                that this seemed to be substantially the basis submitted to the
                                Chinese several weeks ago by the Japanese and which the Chinese
                                rejected. Dr. Stuart said that Japanese military hope to be in
                                occupation of the Lunghai Railway shortly and that after that occurs
                                the Japanese will be willing to enter into a truce with Chiang Kai
                                Shek not exceeding 4 weeks to allow time for preliminary peace
                                negotiations to take form; that the Japanese would be willing to
                                discuss peace terms with Chiang Kai Shek himself (which is contrary
                                to repeated announcements from Tokyo) or a responsible
                                representative or representatives. Dr. Stuart who is very close to
                                some of the leaders in the Provisional Government stated also that
                                the Japanese favor some sort of a plan for “internationalizing the
                                Yangtze valley.” The term is vague but I believe it means the return
                                of the Yangtze River (and perhaps the adjacent cities and
                                countryside) to the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> prevailing
                                before the trouble began. Dr. Stuart further stated that the
                                Japanese will not insist upon the withdrawal of Chiang Kai Shek from
                                the present Government and that they would recognize that the
                                British Government has a special sphere of influence in Kwangtung
                                and Kwangsi and that similarly it would recognize that the Soviet
                                Republic has a special sphere of influence in Kansu, Sinkiang and
                                Ninghsia. I told Stuart that the Chinese would undoubtedly have some
                                very pronounced views on these two points as well as on the
                                others.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Stuart hopes at least to obtain from Chiang a statement of the
                                basis on which Chiang would be willing to negotiate and having
                                obtained such a statement it will be taken or communicated at once
                                    <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0114"/>to Tokyo. I do not know
                                whether the Japanese authorities at Tokyo have knowledge of Dr.
                                Stuart’s mission.</p>

                            <p>129. T. V. Soong arrived in Hankow about February 23. On February 26
                                he talked with McHugh and sent me confidentially a message which he
                                thought would interest our Government. Following is synopsis of this
                                information: Cora, the Italian Ambassador, accompanied by Ito the
                                “unofficial Japanese Ambassador” arrived in Hong Kong just before
                                Soong left and brought greetings and presents to him from Ciano<note
                                    n="76" xml:id="d114fn76">Count Galeazzo Ciano di Cortellazzo,
                                    Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> which led Soong to
                                think that Mussolini and Ciano sanctioned the visit. The Ambassador
                                said he had come to talk about peace terms and that his position was
                                different from that taken by the German Ambassador in December
                                because he would convey only such terms as he personally believed to
                                be a reasonable basis for negotiation. The terms outlined by Cora
                                were described by him as “very lenient” and were roughly as follows:
                                (1) China shall recognize Manchukuo; (2) Japan shall station
                                garrisons in North China; (3) Japan shall have economic privileges
                                in the same area; (4) a neutral zone shall be established in the
                                Shanghai area but Japan shall not demand a Japanese concession; (5)
                                an indemnity shall be paid. Soong inquired of Cora which nation
                                should receive the indemnity and whether the intention was for Japan
                                to indemnify China for the destruction of Nanking and the bombing of
                                Shanghai. Cora answered that after every war an indemnity always had
                                to be paid and that naturally Japan expected something. Soong said
                                he tried to be tactful with the Italian Ambassador because he hoped
                                that friendly relations might be restored eventually and also was
                                very careful with Ito “because unofficial representatives are always
                                the most dangerous”. Soong commented to McHugh that the terms
                                described above were more moderate than earlier ones and he felt
                                they showed that Japan wished to end the hostilities as soon as
                                possible but that China would go on fighting because there was no
                                possible solution of the present crisis.</p>
                            <p>Soong said that shortly before Cora’s visit a representative of
                                Matsui had called on him and had promised “very easy terms” if he
                                    <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0115"/>would discuss peace.
                                Soong thought the approach had been made to him because the Japanese
                                thought him trustworthy and possessed of enough influence both
                                within and outside of China to enable him to speak authoritatively.
                                This was the end of the message.</p>
                            <p>In informal conversation Soong expressed doubt whether the
                                Chamberlain Government in Great Britain as reorganized would last
                                long and said that any close association between Great Britain and
                                Germany and Italy was “unnatural”; that a durable policy could be
                                based only on complete understanding with the United States and that
                                as long as the present British Government remains in power this
                                would be impossible. McHugh inquired whether it was possible that
                                Great Britain might veer toward Japan in the present struggle in
                                order, for example, to preserve the integrity of the customs. Soong
                                thought this possible and that the Japanese had ceased to await
                                friendly overtures from the British and were taking the initiative
                                in cultivating the British.</p>

                            <p>87. Peiping’s 136, February 27, 10 a.m. In proceeding as indicated in
                                the telegram under reference Dr. Leighton Stuart is of course not
                                acting on behalf of or with the approval of this Government. I
                                desire that, upon the arrival of Stuart at Hankow, you ask him to
                                make abundantly clear to such officials of the Chinese Government as
                                he may approach that this Government is in no way associated with
                                his action. Please ask him also to make this clear to Wang Ke-ming
                                and to the Japanese military authorities with whose knowledge and
                                acquiescence he left Peiping for Hankow, as well as to any other
                                Japanese authorities with whom he may have discussion of this
                                matter. You should also point out to him in tactful language that
                                assumption by an American private citizen of the role of an
                                intermediary between authorities of foreign countries in relation to
                                a question of major international import, or participation by such
                                citizens in deliberation by such authorities with regard to high
                                governmental policies are forms of activities which create and
                                entail tremendous personal responsibilities and have been shown by
                                experience to have more often unfortunate than beneficial
                                consequences. I desire further that as suitable opportunity presents
                                itself you discreetly inform the appropriate authorities of the
                                Chinese Government of the fact that Stuart is not acting on behalf
                                of or with the approval of this Government.</p>

                            <p>137. Peiping’s 136, February 27, 10 a.m. to the Department. I feel
                                fairly sure that it would be possible for me to discourage Stuart’s
                                mission by informally conveying knowledge thereof to Chinese
                                authorities. I feel however that it would be most unwise to do this,
                                and unless instructed otherwise I propose to ignore Stuart’s mission
                                entirely. I also propose to refuse to be the channel for
                                communicating any messages which he may desire transmitted in
                                connection therewith, as I do not feel that conditions warrant our
                                becoming sponsor for such discussions at this time even by
                                implication.</p>

                                that affairs in China have reached a relatively “static” stage. The
                                immediate preoccupation of the French is the question of the Chinese
                                    customs.<note n="78" xml:id="d119fn78">See <ref target="#pg_626"
                                        >pp. 626</ref> ff.</note> The British Ambassador in Tokyo
                                presented yesterday or will present today a request that customs
                                revenues pledged for the service of foreign loans be deposited in a
                                British bank at Shanghai or if the Japanese insist upon the deposit
                                in the Yokohama Specie Bank of the revenues pledged for Japanese
                                loans, then at least the revenues earmarked for other foreign loans
                                should be placed in the British bank. The Foreign Office here feels
                                that the Japanese will insist upon the deposit of all customs
                                receipts in the Japanese bank but is hopeful that an arrangement can
                                be worked out to control satisfactorily the disbursement of these
                                funds.</p>
                            <p>The Chinese are still getting a few airplanes from France via the
                                Indo-China route in fulfillment of orders “placed before the
                                outbreak of hostilities”. (I have the impression that this phrase is
                                interpreted with some elasticity.) In this connection the Naval
                                    Attaché<note n="79" xml:id="d119fn79">Capt. Francis Cogswell, U.
                                    S. N.</note> is confidentially informed that an order was
                                recently placed for China for 30 <hi rend="italic">Potez–63</hi>
                                planes, a latest type French light bomber-pursuit plane.</p>
                            <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0118"/>
                            <p>Hoppenot said that the Russians are steadily increasing their
                                shipments of airplanes and war material to China. How this is being
                                financed is a puzzle to the French. Sun Fo, the son of Sun Yat-sen
                                and President of the Chinese Legislative Yuan, has been in Russia
                                for 2 months arranging it. It is believed that his visit has had to
                                do with financing and accelerating Russian shipments of war supplies
                                to China.</p>
                            <p>Sun Fo is due in Paris next week but the only information the French
                                Government has received regarding his visit here is that it is of a
                                personal nature to get in touch with old friends, et cetera.</p>
                            <p>Apart from shipments of supplies to China the Foreign Office is
                                convinced that the Soviet Government will continue to refrain from
                                taking any more direct or aggressive interest in the Chino-Japanese
                                conflict. On the other hand, the French Ambassador in Tokyo has
                                reported that without any tangible proof he nevertheless has the
                                “feeling” that the Japanese may be preparing for a move against the
                                Russian maritime provinces. My informant said that although he did
                                not himself share this feeling he knew that it existed on the part
                                of other competent observers of the Far East who reason as follows:
                                The Japanese Army chiefs realize that today the Japanese people are
                                worked up to a pitch where they will accept any sacrifice in
                                prosecution of war; that if this patriotic fervor is allowed to
                                subside it will be extremely difficult to whip it up again; and that
                                therefore advantage should be taken of this situation to strike
                                against Russia. Furthermore these military chiefs are convinced that
                                they will be able to wage a successful war against Russia while
                                holding the Chinese in check on their flank with little difficulty.
                                My informant added that this was also the view of many French
                                military officers.</p>
                            <p>Referring to the recall [of] General Matsui, my informant said that
                                it was possible that the real reason for his return to Japan was to
                                be prepared to head a military coup in case the national
                                mobilization bill should be defeated by the civilian opposition of
                                the army. Matsui is just the person he said to head a movement of
                                this sort.</p>

                                mission to Hankow. He did not ask me to transmit the information
                                contained in my 136, February 27, 10 a.m. I transmitted it as
                                information which I believed the Ambassador and the Department
                                should have notwithstanding it was given to me confidentially. To
                                avoid violating a confidence, however, I asked Dr. Stuart if he had
                                any objection to my informing the Ambassador and the Department of
                                the object of his trip to Hankow and he said he had no objection.
                                Heretofore, Stuart has made it a point to call on me just before
                                leaving Peiping on his periodical trips to inform me of his
                                destination, object of his trip, length of his stay and of
                                conditions at Yenching. He volunteered the information contained in
                                my 136, February 27, 10 a.m., and stated that he was undoubtedly
                                asked to proceed to Hankow for the purpose named because of the long
                                standing friendship between himself and Chiang Kai Shek. I made no
                                comment other than that contained in my 136, February 27, 10
                                a.m.</p>

                                        favorable to Chinese: General determination to resist to
                                        bitter end, educated and moneyed classes gradually taking
                                        part, more students in ranks, enormous man power, military
                                        training of reserves going on everywhere, more favorable
                                        outlook for munitions supply, good financial position
                                        according to foreign financial advisers, losses in men fully
                                        replaced, gradual improvement in the command, experience in
                                        fighting being acquired, increased foreign support in
                                        aviation, communication by motor roads being greatly
                                        improved (road open to Sinkiang, work started on outlet to
                                        Burmah, outlet to Indo-China nearly ready), another instance

                                        nearly ready, loyal cooperation by the Reds, good example of

                                        no apparent depression due to loss of men and territory,
                                        guerrilla war in Shansi growing serious, Japanese let down
                                        since capture of Nanking, Japanese failure to press to an
                                        objective, Japanese failure to get Chinese help politically,
                                        time working for Chinese and against Japanese, China’s basic
                                        industry, agriculture, cannot be destroyed, moral backing of
                                        the democratic states, no serious dissension in China’s
                                        Government.</p>
                                    <p>Factors unfavorable to Chinese: no sign as yet of the
                                        offensive spirit, continued dependence on passive defense,
                                        continued excuses about <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116"
                                            facs="0120"/>insufficient artillery and aviation,
                                        retention of many incompetent commanders, many desertions,
                                        many self-inflicted wounds, danger of spread of guerrilla
                                        idea to regular units (they will withdraw as soon as the
                                        pressure hurts), loss of revenue.</p>
                                    <p>Conclusion: Since Japan cannot pull out and China refuses to
                                        quit, the prospect of a long drawn out struggle increases.
                                        It is possible for China to win. Japan, to get a decision,
                                        must make a greatly increased effort. I still believe she
                                        must occupy all China east of the 110th meridian, and that
                                        even that may not be enough.”</p>

                                yesterday, he described a meeting of Eden, Delbos,<note n="83"
                                    xml:id="d122fn83">French Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note>
                                Wellington Koo and himself held in Geneva last month in which the
                                Japanese situation was discussed. He said that the discussion had to
                                do with renewed efforts along the lines of the Brussels
                                    Conference;<note n="84" xml:id="d122fn84">See <ref

                                stand without England’s express backing on account of the fear for
                                Indo-China; that Eden would take no stand without assurance of
                                parallel action by the United States; that the situation was left
                                with the understanding that Eden would explore the situation with
                                Washington; that it was recognized that the United States Government
                                would participate in no alliance but hope was had that something
                                might be accomplished through parallel action; that what
                                specifically was considered was not military or naval action but the
                                imposing of sanctions that would prevent Japanese banking
                                institutions from selling securities in enterprises in China and
                                Manchuria among nationals of these countries and, second, the
                                possibility of imposing sanctions on supplies, particularly oil.
                                Litvinov was pessimistic as to outcome of any such plan. As
                                illustrative, he pointed out that an embargo on oil would require
                                not only action by the United States but also action by Holland and
                                that in all probability Holland would not participate except under
                                guaranties of military and naval defense by the other powers.</p>
                            <p>I gathered that the Soviet attitude, similar to French and English,
                                was that it will take no action except with the assured support of
                                France or England or both.</p>
                            <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0121"/>
                            <p>With reference to the European situation, Litvinov’s opinion was that
                                Hitler and Mussolini had Chamberlain on the spot; that Chamberlain
                                had to make good with his public by effecting some arrangement; that
                                the dictators would either drive so hard a bargain as to make that
                                impossible or that Chamberlain would secure a paper peace that
                                really amounted to nothing except as a sham for home
                                consumption.</p>

                            <p>367. I have today carried out the instructions contained in the
                                penultimate paragraph of the Department’s 87, February 28, 6 p.m. to
                                the Ambassador. The person concerned states that he is fully aware
                                that he is acting in a purely private capacity, that he is in no
                                sense an intermediary between any governments, that he is simply
                                trying to maintain the personal relations between Chinese friends of
                                his who are in responsible positions in Hankow and Peiping and
                                Shanghai, that he will try to see that we are in no way embarrassed
                                in the matter and that he agrees in general with the views expressed
                                by the Department. For the rest, his trip is simply an attempt to
                                understand the outlook better in its practical bearing on his
                                University affairs.</p>

                                Government at Peiping and on territorial officials. In the <hi

                                instructions which were being sent by the British Government to the
                                British Embassy in China on that subject, and the hope was expressed
                                that this Government might see its way clear to adopting a similar
                                procedure.</p>
                            <p>It will be recalled that on January 21, 1938, during a call at the
                                Department of Mr. Mallet, Counselor of the British Embassy, Mr.
                                Hamilton informed Mr. Mallet of the substance of the Department’s
                                instructions to the American Embassy at Peiping in regard to the
                                question of calls on representatives of the new régime. This
                                Government has given further consideration to this matter, and as a
                                result it has issued to the American Embassy in Peiping
                                supplementary instructions to the effect that informal relations,
                                including exchange of calls, with representatives of the new régime
                                should, so far as is practicable, be restricted to officers acting
                                in their consular capacity. It may be mentioned that three members
                                of the staff of the American Embassy at Peiping have the dual status
                                of diplomatic officer and consular officer.</p>

                            <p>Mr. M. Tani, Japanese Minister at Large who recently arrived in
                                Shanghai, informed Japanese press representatives that he had been
                                placed in charge of all Japanese diplomatic organs in Central and
                                North China and would commute frequently between Shanghai and
                                Peiping. He is also reported to have stated that Japanese intend to
                                respect fully foreign rights and interests in China and with
                                reference to Anglo-Japanese relations that “there can be no friction
                                between Japan and Britain unless Japan infringes British trade
                                interests and vested rights in the Orient. This has especially been
                                made true by the replacement of Eden diplomacy by Chamberlain
                                diplomacy or in other words the replacement of idealism by realism.
                                Japan must pay careful attention to this point so as not to violate
                                Britain’s rights and interests”.</p>

                                Chekiang, was assassinated here on March 7th. His assassination is
                                reported to have been connected with overtures made to him by the

                                Hankow, which has for its apparent object suggestions to General
                                Chiang Kai-shek for a possible compromise between the Chinese and
                                Japanese Governments.</p>
                            <p>The idea that such a compromise might be possible seems to have
                                occurred to a number of persons, and there have reached me
                                intimations that various persons would be willing to take steps to
                                promote a settling of the present conflict.</p>
                            <p>In this connection I have the honor to enclose memoranda<note n="86"
                                    xml:id="d127fn86">Not printed.</note> of conversations with a
                                Mr. Cressey,<note n="87" xml:id="d127fn87">Earl H. Cressy, of the

                                1938, and with Mr. John Foster Dulles, well-known writer and lawyer,
                                on the subject of mediation.</p>
                            <p>It will be noted that Mr. Cressey was actuated by a desire to bring
                                Chinese and Japanese Christians together in the interest of peace,

                            <p>It will be observed that Mr. Dulles and I agreed that there was no
                                basis upon which either the Government or the citizens of the United
                                States could attempt to act as mediators between China and Japan,
                                and that I expressed the view that the present Chinese Government
                                would be forced to continue resistance against Japan until it should
                                be wiped out, or until the Japanese Government should be prepared to
                                consider a settlement on some precisely defined basis, in
                                distinction to earlier so-called “terms,” which have been so general
                                in scope as to permit the interpretation that Japan intends to
                                reduce China to a condition of vassalage.</p>

                                position to exert a firmer influence in the Far East and might even

                            <p>On the afternoon of March 9, the day following my conversation with
                                Mr. Dulles, Dr. Hsu Mo, Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, informed
                                Mr. Peck, Counselor of the Embassy, in the course of a general
                                conversation, that the Chinese Government was somewhat puzzled over
                                the failure of the American and British Governments to adopt
                                stronger measures than had been taken by them to protect their
                                treaty and other rights in China from infringement by Japan; in the
                                case of Great Britain the Chinese Government was inclined to
                                attribute this failure to the preoccupation of the British
                                Government with the Italian threat to British interests in the
                                Mediterranean. Assuming this reasoning to be well-founded, officials
                                in the Chinese Government were speculating on the course which Great
                                Britain might follow in the Far East in the face of Japanese
                                encroachments if, as seems probable, the present Italian-British
                                discussions result in a friendly understanding between the two
                                countries in reference to various points at issue between them. Dr.
                                Hsu Mo said that one view was that Great Britain was showing a clear
                                tendency to deal realistically with Germany, Italy and Japan,
                                members of the Anti-Comintern group, and that when its hands were
                                comparatively free in Europe Great Britain would come to an
                                understanding with Japan over British interests in the Far East,
                                more or less ignoring China; while another view was that Great
                                Britain would, when the time arrived, take a strong attitude toward
                                Japan in defense of British rights in the Orient.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Dulles had conversations with General Chiang Kai-shek and other
                                Chinese leaders on March 6–8, inclusive, and it is possible that
                                these speculations regarding probable British action were suggested
                                by him to the Chinese, or vice versa, but I am unable to hazard any
                                opinion regarding this.</p>

                                military, diplomatic and consular officials were present, General

                                with Japan and war on the Kuomintang and the Communist Party; that

                            <p>75. My 56, February 14, 6 p.m.<note n="89" xml:id="d129fn89">Not
                                    printed.</note> I was told yesterday evening by the same
                                    information<note n="90" xml:id="d129fn90">An “official of the
                                    Japanese Embassy at Nanking.”</note> mentioned in my No. 56,
                                that the new government for Central China would be set up within the
                                very near future but that the actual date could not yet be
                                announced. There is still said to be some difference of opinion as
                                to whether Shanghai or <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0126"
                                />Nanking will be the seat of the new government though Nanking is
                                believed to be the more likely site.</p>
                            <p>Upon being asked what connection this new government would have with
                                the regime now functioning in Peiping, my informant stated that this
                                was perhaps the most delicate matter to be solved but that it was
                                probable the two governments would be independent of each other. The
                                reasons for this were said to be that Japan feels more confident of
                                her ability to control as well as develop economically the region
                                now under the Peiping regime but that in South and Central China it
                                would be much more difficult directly to control the government and
                                it will be impossible fully to develop economically Central and
                                South China without foreign assistance. It is believed that foreign
                                governments or private business interests will not give the desired
                                cooperation to a regime in Central China which is so obviously and
                                directly controlled by Japan as the Peiping Government.</p>
                            <p>My informant then stated that Japan fully realizes the difficulties
                                facing her in Central China and that she is hopeful that some
                                Western nation will come to understand Japan’s true aims in this
                                region and come forward with an offer to cooperate in its economic
                                exploits. He stated that one foreign government was rumored to be
                                making tentative suggestion along this line but that Japan wanted
                                more than anything else to have real friendship and cooperation with
                                the United States and it hoped that America would be the country
                                which would cooperate with Japan in an economic and commercial way.
                                I stated that America’s only interest was to see peace and order
                                restored as quickly as possible and to see that the interests and
                                rights of its citizens were respected. I added that at the present
                                time there could be no question of cooperating with Japan inasmuch
                                as the American attitude was one of strict neutrality. I was then
                                told it was hoped that this new government of Central China would be
                                the medium through which foreign nations might work with Japan in
                                the economic development of the country. However, this could only be
                                done if the Western nations ceased their policy of giving
                                encouragement to the government of Chiang Kai Shek. In this
                                connection I was told that the Japanese had been greatly
                                disappointed at the announced decision of the new British Ambassador
                                to fly to Chungking to present his credentials to the Chinese
                                Government. With the exception of stating that the ideas advanced by
                                my informant were interesting, I made noncommittal rejoinders and
                                the subject was then changed.</p>
                            <p>I was told that a new China Affairs Bureau was shortly to be set up
                                in Tokyo headed by Mr. Toshio Shiratori, former Japanese Minister to
                                Sweden, and at present on a special mission in Peiping. This bureau
                                will report directly to the Cabinet rather than to the Foreign
                                Minister and will have among its personnel representatives of the
                                army and navy, though the majority will probably be taken <pb
                                    n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0127"/>from the present China
                                Bureau of the Foreign Office. It will be the function of this bureau
                                to coordinate the viewpoints regarding China of the military and
                                civilian elements in Japan and then to make concrete plans for the
                                carrying out of Japanese policy towards this country. It is
                                interesting to note that Mr. Shiratori, who will seemingly occupy a
                                leading position in the formulation and carrying out of Japan’s
                                continental policy, has made the following statement in a recent
                                issue of the magazine <hi rend="italic">Chuokoron</hi>, published in
                                translation in the <hi rend="italic">Japan Advertiser</hi> of
                                February 4th “Japan may send her immigrants to the continent or
                                undertake to develop natural resources there, but over and above
                                such materialistic considerations she takes it as part of her
                                cultural mission to enlighten the various Asiatic races on the
                                continent and relieve them from their present miserable condition.
                                For the realization of this national ideal she is determined to have
                                her own way and will combat any influence attempting to thwart her
                                course of advance.”</p>

                            <p>78. During an informal conversation yesterday evening with a Japanese
                                official the question of foreign rights and interests in China came
                                up for discussion and I was given the following information said to
                                be typical of the viewpoint of high ranking army officers in China
                                on this question. My informant said that at a dinner he attended
                                given on March 13, by Lieutenant General Fukita, the new
                                Commander-in-Chief in this area, General Fukita had stated it was
                                his opinion that there was no reason why the Japanese Army should
                                give any consideration to foreign rights and interests as long as
                                the foreign <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0128"/>governments
                                continued to give encouragement and assistance to Japan’s enemy,
                                namely, the government of Chiang Kai Shek. He is said to have added
                                that it might be necessary to respect foreign rights already
                                established but that in the future foreign interests should be
                                disregarded unless the various nations changed their present
                                attitude towards Japan’s activities in China. Reference was made to
                                the displeasure of the army at Western nations providing China with
                                military supplies and I pointed out that while it is true that
                                military supplies are being sold to China, they are also being sold
                                to Japan and that any attempt to govern the sales of munitions to
                                but one party to a dispute would be equivalent to taking sides,
                                which was not the desire of the United States.</p>
                            <p>It is perhaps interesting to note that during the course of this
                                conversation my informant referred on several occasions to the
                                action of Hitler in Austria<note n="91" xml:id="d130fn91">See <ref

                                        >i</hi>, pp. 384</ref> ff.</note> and stated that this
                                action had been a great encouragement to the Japanese in carrying on
                                their activities in China.</p>

                                of the American Government who have occasion to make statements
                                relating to American national interest or policy should be
                                extraordinarily careful in their phrasing of such statements.</p>

                                submitted by the Legislative Bureau and the Foreign Office for the
                                establishment of machinery to govern China affairs, the Japanese
                                Government decided on March 15 to create the China Economic Affairs
                                Bureau under the direction of the Cabinet.</p>
                            <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0132"/>
                            <p>Originally, the Legislative Bureau proposed the establishment of an
                                organ under the Premier to be called the Cabinet China Affairs Board
                                and to be entrusted with political, economic, and cultural matters
                                relating to China, independently of the Foreign Office. Opposing
                                this plan, Mr. Hirota and the Foreign Office stood out for the
                                establishment of a bureau under the direction of the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs but not necessarily an integral part of the Foreign
                                Office, to handle economic exploitation of China but without any
                                authority to deal with political or cultural matters, which would be
                                controlled as hitherto by the Foreign Office. According to the
                                Japanese press, the Minister for Foreign Affairs insisted that
                                Japan’s policy toward China was entirely different from that toward
                                Manchuria, that the political, economic, and cultural body projected
                                by the Legislative Bureau would possibly be accused of infringing
                                upon China’s sovereignty and would hence be displeasing to third
                                countries, and that, aside from relations with the Powers, for
                                technical reasons alone administrative affairs relating to China
                                should be left to the Foreign Office.</p>
                            <p>Apparently unable to reconcile the conflicting points of view between
                                the Legislative Bureau and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the
                                Cabinet arrived at the compromise plan mentioned above, namely, to
                                create the China Economic Affairs Bureau which would have no voice
                                in diplomatic matters and whose principal duty would be to supervise
                                the North China Development Company and the Central China
                                Rehabilitation Company. It is understood that there will also be set
                                up a provisional body to be called the China Economic Inquiry
                                Commission, headed by the Premier, composed of members chosen from
                                the Cabinet, the Cabinet’s Advisory Counsel, and financial circles,
                                and entrusted with examination of matters relating to economic
                                exploitation of China.</p>
                            <p>There may be a substantial amount of truth in the report that Mr.
                                Hirota opposed the establishment of a political, economic, and
                                cultural board to control China affairs on the ground that such a
                                step would unnecessarily antagonize countries possessed of treaty
                                rights with China and would lay Japan open to the accusation that it
                                contemplated a definite infringement of China’s sovereignty and
                                administrative integrity. While the respect by Japan of China’s
                                sovereignty and administrative integrity is only a fiction advanced
                                by the Japanese Government, the placing of China affairs under an
                                organization akin to the Manchurian Affairs Bureau would undoubtedly
                                hamper Japan’s well-known dialectics on its actions in China.</p>
                            <p>It has been remarked by observers in Tokyo that Mr. Hirota’s
                                antagonism toward the setting up of a body, distinct from the
                                Foreign Office, to deal with Chinese matters was due to a desire to
                                check the ambitions of the militarists and of the more nationalistic
                                members <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0133"/>of the Cabinet.
                                However, it is more likely that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is
                                loath to relinquish a power which he has wielded firmly and is
                                unwilling to turn over the direction of China affairs to a group of
                                men who might take a more moderate view toward the Chinese than that
                                assumed by the Foreign Office itself.</p>
                            <p>In this connection the Department’s attention is invited to my
                                telegram No. 100 of February 12, 1938, in which it was stated that
                                reports had come both to the British Ambassador and to me that it
                                was Mr. Hirota rather than Admiral Suetsugu, the Home Minister, who
                                led the ultra-chauvinistic element in the Government. Likewise
                                pertinent is a despatch to me from Mr. William T. Turner, Consul at
                                Dairen, a copy of which he sent to the Department,<note n="5"
                                    xml:id="d136fn5">Not printed.</note> in which is reported a
                                conversation between Mr. Turner and a Japanese official (presumably
                                Mr. Okazaki, Japanese Consul-General-at-large for China). The
                                Japanese official in question said that the Japanese military were
                                taking a more moderate position toward China than the Cabinet, that
                                Admiral Suetsugu was about the most moderate man in the Cabinet as
                                regards China policies, that Mr. Hirota and Prince Konoye were the
                                leaders of those advocating a strong hand in China, and that it was
                                the civilians who were “pressing hard for a fundamental solution of
                                the issue with Chiang Kai-shek.”</p>

                                reports of impending inauguration at Nanking of a provisional
                                government, Foreign Minister Hirota has stated in the House of
                                Representatives that Japan’s relations with the existing Peiping
                                regime will not thereby be changed; that Japan expects that the
                                Peiping regime will in time develop into a unified administration
                                for both North and Central China; but that in the meantime
                                commercial interests contemplating activities in Central China must
                                deal with the impending Nanking regime.</p>

                            <p>465. My 403, March 16, 5 p.m. The “Reformed Government of the
                                Republic of China” was formally inaugurated at Nanking at 10 a.m.
                                this morning. Representatives of General Hata and Admiral Hasegawa
                                were present and in addition to felicitating the new Government upon
                                its inauguration indicated that they would give it strong
                                support.</p>
                            <p>A long manifesto issued by the “Reformed Government of the Republic
                                of China” was distributed in Shanghai this morning. The manifesto
                                takes the National Government severely to task for driving “an
                                untrained populace to fight in an unequal combat” and charges that
                                the policy of “scorched earth spells national suicide and in
                                affiliating with the Communists they have invited robbers into our
                                home”. The manifesto continues: “though still keeping up the
                                pretense of a government in their refuge in Szechuan, Hupeh and
                                Hunan, they have forfeited their authority and virtually lost their
                                power of control. The record of the misdeeds perpetrated by this
                                defunct administration is indeed unequalled in the long annals of
                                the history of China. Impelled by feelings of righteous indignation
                                in consideration of the urgency of saving the country from ruin, in
                                view of the necessity of discarding the old regime and starting anew
                                with the citizens of the Republic, the undersigned and their
                                associates do hereby proclaim on this the 28th day of March the
                                Reformed Government of the Republic of China in Nanking and that its
                                primary duty is to restore the territorial sovereignty of the
                                Republic as it existed prior to the outbreak of hostilities. In
                                pursuing this aim negotiations will be started to restore the ties
                                of amity and to end the deplorable strife between neighboring states
                                whose peoples are of the same race. On the other hand the friendly
                                relations happily existing between this country and the European and
                                American powers will be maintained and upheld.”</p>
                            <p>The manifesto states further that inasmuch us the “Reformed
                                Government is founded on the realities of the prevailing situation
                                in the provinces of Kiangsu, Chekiang and others it is therefore
                                temporary in nature and is established without any intention of
                                contending with the administration of the Provisional Government.
                                Functions pertaining to a central government which cannot be
                                delegated will continue to be performed by the Provisional
                                Government in consultation with the Reformed Government. As soon as
                                communications are restored on the Tsinpu and Lunghai railways the
                                Reformed Government <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0135"/>will
                                amalgamate itself with the Provisional Government. It is not our
                                desire to have two rival governments functioning within the
                                country.”</p>
                            <p>The manifesto is signed by Liang Hung Chih, Wen Tsung Yao and others
                                mentioned in my 403, March 16, 5 p.m. The new Government is to be
                                headed by Liang Hung Chih at least for the time being, it is
                                reported locally. The inauguration of the new regime at Nanking has
                                thus far created little stir locally. Two small demonstrations
                                organized by the so-called “Great Way Government” took place this
                                morning in the extra-Settlement roads area and West Hongkew
                                respectively while a Japanese plane scattered leaflets.</p>

                                    According to the Japanese press, this organ will be the highest

                                <item>The local Japanese military spokesman outlined this morning
                                    alleged Japanese successes in southern Shantung, northern Honan,
                                    and Shansi. None of them appears to alter the military situation
                                    significantly. Chinese reports indicate some successes in
                                    counter attacks by Chinese forces. From the reports of both
                                    sides it would appear that Japanese advances in southern
                                    Shantung and Shansi have been checked, at least temporarily, and
                                    that severe engagements are in progress in which Japanese as
                                    well as Chinese forces are suffering heavy losses.</item>

                                <item>A strike began March 24 among Chinese workers of the Kailan
                                    Mining Company in eastern Hopei and has affected several mines
                                    of <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0136"/>the company. At one
                                    mine 15 strikers were reportedly killed March 25 and 40 wounded
                                    while 7 or 8 Chinese of a “self protection” corps were also
                                    killed. Strikers are understood to have occupied on March 27 the
                                    compound and offices of the company of Tangshan. The strikers
                                    have not yet damaged company property. The origin of the strike
                                    is obscure but there is evidence which indicated that, if
                                    Japanese interests did not instigate the trouble, they may now
                                    be making use of it in the hope of obtaining control of the
                                    company’s interests. The local British Embassy is understood to
                                    have requested the assistance of the Japanese authorities in
                                    settling the strike.<note n="8" xml:id="d139fn8">The mines were

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that a
                                couple of days ago, during one of the calls he makes occasionally on
                                me, the Japanese Consul General in Hong Kong asked the definite
                                question of what I thought would be the effect on American interests
                                and public opinion of the severing by Japanese forces of
                                communication between Hong Kong and Canton. As he arrived at the
                                posing of this question by even more than his usual circumlocution I
                                suspect that it may have been an inspired one.</p>
                            <p>My reply was, of course, noncommittal. I then casually asked if he
                                thought a campaign to that end was about to begin. He said that he
                                didn’t know definitely about that but was sure that “something must
                                be done” soon to interrupt the flow of war supplies from Hong Kong
                                into Kwangtung. Mr. Nakamura, who was Japanese Consul General at
                                Canton until the present hostilities began, then went on to say that
                                the Kwangtung authorities were becoming definitely “fed-up with
                                Chiang Kai-shek” and were, he thought, progressively weakening in
                                their support of the so-called National Government. Kwangtung, he
                                said, had in the beginning sent many troops to fight under Chiang
                                Kai-shek’s command but these troops had persistently been placed in
                                the front firing line and killed to such an extent that no more
                                considerable bodies of them would be sent from Kwangtung Province.
                                He cited the thousands of Kwangtung soldiers betrayed by Chiang
                                Kai-shek’s troops at Nanking. According to information which he
                                claimed to have, Kwangtung troops would now be kept at home and, <pb
                                    n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0137"/>furthermore, a goodly
                                proportion of the war materials passing through Hong Kong for the
                                Chinese National Government would be kept in Canton for the use of
                                Kwangtung troops. In brief, my Japanese colleague expressed the firm
                                opinion that both Canton and Yunnanfu (Kunming) were becoming less
                                and less inclined to support Hankow and were, of course, beginning
                                to see more and more the light of reason and their own best
                                interests.</p>
                            <p>Undoubtedly my Japanese colleague’s thoughts have been fathered by
                                his wishes. On the other hand expression of many similar thoughts is
                                heard in Hong Kong from sources which are neither Japanese nor
                                biassed by any national or selfish motives, and that is why my
                                Japanese colleague’s conversation has seemed to be of more than
                                average interest. We have undertaken no special investigation to
                                endeavor to verify the alleged state of affairs in Kwangtung and
                                Yunnan, as such would not seem to be within the jurisdiction of this
                                office, but copies of this despatch are being referred to the
                                appropriate offices in China proper.</p>
                            <p>As to the intention of the Japanese soon to make an effort to cut
                                communication between Hong Kong and Canton the only information of
                                direct relation, which is available here, is that from usually
                                reliable sources to the effect that there have recently been a
                                noticeably greater number of Japanese naval units in the waters near
                                Hong Kong. There is no reasonable confirmation that troop transports
                                have increased in number.</p>
                            <p>Very respectfully,</p>

                            <p>At the conclusion of the emergency session of the Kuomintang
                                (National Party) National Congress today there was issued a
                                manifesto defining China’s foreign and domestic policies.</p>
                            <p>In regard to the hostilities with Japan the Manifesto says that the
                                security of the northern Provinces means the security of China as a
                                whole. If they cannot be preserved, not only the hope of a
                                reasonable settlement of the question of the four north-eastern
                                Provinces will be forever lost, but the whole territory of China
                                will virtually be gone. “Our final object is peace, which has been
                                the basis of our policy. But the peace we value is the peace founded
                                upon justice. The peace patched up at the expense of justice is no
                                peace at all. It is mere surrender.” The hope for peaceful
                                co-existence between <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0138"/>China
                                and Japan cannot be fulfilled until Japan has courageously forsaken
                                her misguided plans and abandoned her policy of aggression, and
                                cooperates with China for the re-establishment of peace on the basis
                                of righteousness and justice. Meanwhile, the struggle must be
                                continued. China is determined not to stop at any sacrifice that may
                                be necessary.</p>
                            <p>China’s foreign relations are governed by two principles: firstly,
                                China will scrupulously respect all the treaties for the maintenance
                                of peace whereto she is a party and unflinchingly defend their
                                sanctity and inviolability; and secondly, China will seek not only
                                to preserve but further promote the friendly relations with other
                                Powers. “At this time of unprecedented national calamity we realise
                                all the more that we should not entertain any false hopes of
                                miraculous happenings, nor entirely count upon foreign assistance,
                                but instead we should rescue ourselves and carry on our struggle by
                                dint of our own efforts amidst whatever difficulties and
                                privations.”</p>
                            <p>Turning to internal problems, the Manifesto says that the guiding
                                principles for building up new China are the San Min Chu I (the
                                Three People’s Principles). China must proceed with the struggle of
                                self-defence simultaneously with the task of national
                                reconstruction. Prior to the promulgation of the permanent
                                Constitution, the Government should set up the organs of
                                participation by the people in public affairs. Efforts should be
                                directed not only towards the maintenance of rural economy but
                                towards its active improvement. Three points are of great
                                importance: first, the entire nation must practice the greatest of
                                economy in accumulating the capital, secondly, all industrial plans
                                must be directed toward one goal, namely, China’s victory, and
                                thirdly, the Government should carry out the planned economy in
                                accordance with the San Min Chu I. The task of carrying on the
                                hostilities and national reconstruction simultaneously seems
                                difficult, but its final achievement is sure if we preserve our
                                internal solidarity and oneness of purpose.</p>
                            <p>Among the important resolutions the Congress adopted were the one
                                calling for the creation of the People’s Political Council to enable
                                the people to participate in public affairs, and another setting up
                                Tsung Chai (Director-General) and Fu Tsung Chai (Deputy
                                Director-General) within the Kuomintang and General Chiang Kai-shek
                                and Mr. Wang Ching-wei were elected thereto respectively. The
                                Congress also adopted a political platform for the Government’s
                                guidance during the period of armed resistance. The platform
                                stipulates that the San Min Chu I shall be the guiding principles of
                                the national thought and re-affirms the freedom of speech,
                                publication and assembly within the bounds of law.</p>

                            <p>91. According to an announcement in this morning’s Nanking <hi
                                    rend="italic">Min Pao</hi>, a spokesman for the Reformed
                                Government of China stated yesterday that the new government will
                                respect the property rights and interests of foreign nations in
                                China in accordance with the principles of international law but
                                that agreements made with the National Government of China (Chiang
                                Kai Shek’s government) by foreign nations will not be recognized and
                                the new government will assume no responsibility nor any obligations
                                towards such agreements.</p>
                            <p>It has not yet been possible to confirm that statement nor to obtain
                                any amplification of it. However, according to the Chinese member of
                                Embassy staff who translated the article today, it is believed the
                                meaning is that all treaties made with foreign nations prior to
                                formation of the National Government in 1927 will be honored as will
                                any which might be made in future with the new government, but all
                                those made between 1927 and 1938 will be disregarded.</p>

                            <p>532. The Chinese Ambassador<note n="10" xml:id="d143fn10">V. K.
                                    Wellington Koo.</note> told me yesterday that he was greatly
                                encouraged by Chinese successes in recent military operations,
                                particularly in southern Shantung. He said that the intense fighting
                                which began in this area on March 24 and has been going on
                                continuously since then constitutes one of the major engagements of
                                the war. He said that there are nearly 200,000 Japanese troops in
                                this region including 50,000 who have been brought secretly from
                                Manchuria since the first of the year; opposing them are over
                                300,000 Chinese.</p>
                            <p>I said that I had noticed an article in the London <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Times</hi> from its Shanghai correspondent reporting the
                                appearance north of Suchow of new Chinese tanks, artillery and
                                anti-tank guns. Wellington Koo said that this was true and that all
                                this material had come from Russia. <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136"
                                    facs="0140"/>He said that the Russians had been “very generous”
                                in furnishing war material, particularly since January 1st. The
                                Chinese have been acquiring very little war material from England;
                                some artillery and rifles but no airplanes. From France they have
                                been receiving but little war material since the French had little
                                to spare, but since the coming into office of the present Blum
                                government on March 13 several military planes of the latest type
                                have been shipped to China.</p>
                            <p>I asked what routes these shipments have followed. Wellington Koo
                                said that part of the material from Russia came in via Hong Kong,
                                part through Indo-China and many shipments of light material take
                                the Alma Ata route. About two-thirds of the new tanks and artillery
                                which have appeared recently north of Suchow came in via Hong Kong
                                and about one-third via Indo-China. French planes were shipped via
                                French Indo-China. The French Government had not raised difficulties
                                about shipment of planes via Indo-China although they had limited
                                the passage of other war material on the Yunnanfu Railway. At one
                                time facilities had been provided in Bordeaux for assembling planes
                                destined for China. When the last Chautemps government came in power
                                the middle of January, however, these facilities had been withdrawn,
                                and increased difficulties had been placed in the way of shipment of
                                war material through Indo-China.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador said that he had always had trouble with the Foreign
                                Office here in obtaining permission for shipments to pass through
                                Indo-China but since the formation of the second Blum government
                                with Paul Boncour at the Foreign Office his task had been made much
                                easier. He said that the French Government was still apprehensive
                                about permitting shipments to go over the railway but that he had
                                recently been given permission to have important shipments of war
                                material which had been held up in Indo-China transshipped and
                                transported through territorial waters of Indo-China to Southern
                                China.</p>
                            <p>I said that I had been interested to meet Sun Fo not long ago in
                                Paris and asked the Ambassador if he could tell me anything of Sun
                                Fo’s mission to Russia. The Ambassador said that Sun Fo had been
                                most successful in arranging for the supply of Russian airplanes and
                                war material. Sun Fo had not been so pleased however with the
                                outcome of his talks concerning “political arrangements”. The Soviet
                                Government had indicated that they could not be expected to enter
                                the conflict in the Far East unless they were assured that in case
                                they did so and Germany should then attack Russia they would receive
                                military support from other countries in Europe.</p>
                            <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0141"/>
                            <p>With regard to rumors concerning Outer Mongolia the Ambassador said
                                that it was not true that the Soviet authorities had asked Sun Fo
                                for certain concessions in return for recognition of full Chinese
                                sovereignty over Outer Mongolia. He said that both sides continued
                                to maintain their respective positions regarding the status of Outer
                                Mongolia and that this situation caused no difficulties for either
                                China or Russia.</p>

                            <p>94. A Tass communiqué published in today’s <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Pravda</hi> states that the Japanese Ambassador protested
                                yesterday to Litvinov<note n="11" xml:id="d144fn11">Soviet Commissar
                                    for Foreign Affairs.</note> against evidence of Soviet planes
                                and pilots fighting for the Chinese, saying that on account of the
                                peculiar structure of the Soviet Government special responsibility
                                lay upon it.</p>
                            <p>Litvinov rejected the protest; said that his Government had sent no
                                military forces or individuals to take part in the war; that other
                                foreign volunteers are serving with Chinese forces and that “the
                                numerous military groups from certain countries (fighting for China)
                                were not only not considered an unfriendly act by the Japanese
                                Government but did not even prevent it from establishing with these
                                countries the closest treaty relations”.</p>
                            <p>The communiqué further brought out the fact that the Soviet Union a
                                few days ago proposed to the Japanese Government a general
                                settlement of many concrete incidents which have arisen between the
                                two Governments, including the detention of the Soviet mail plane
                                and of two Soviet schooners by the Japanese authorities, the failure
                                to make payments for the Chinese Eastern Railway and Japanese claims
                                regarding alleged oppression of Japanese citizens in the Soviet
                                Union.</p>
                            <p>A new incident between the two countries indignantly publicised in
                                the Moscow press of April 3 was the alleged endeavor of the Japanese
                                Chargé d’Affaires at Kabul in the course of a “courtesy call” upon
                                a, new Soviet Ambassador to enlist him as a spy in the service of
                                the Japanese.</p>

                                the Japanese northward toward Yihsien. The Japanese 10th Division
                                which has borne the brunt of the fighting in the Taierchwang sector
                                for the past 2 weeks is reported to have suffered heavy casualties
                                and to have been disorganized. The Japanese military authorities
                                here continue to deny reports of Chinese victories.</p>

                            <p>239. There is much discussion in the press of a possible change of
                                Government in the near future. Press accounts of the situation
                                within the Cabinet and evidence presented to support forecasts of
                                political changes are obscure, contradictory and I believe largely
                                speculative. The only statement of fact which I am now prepared to
                                make is that the Cabinet is apparently not united in matters of
                                important policy and that its reorganization is under consideration.
                                Our analysis of the situation made in the light of discussions in
                                the press and orally by well informed Japanese is presented
                                hereunder.</p>

                                <item>The most important element in the situation is a difference of
                                    opinion that has developed within the Cabinet as to the courses,
                                    military and political, which should be pursued by Japan in
                                    dealing with the conflict with China. Our best information is
                                    that Konoye heads a group which believes that it is not enough
                                    for Japan to cease “dealing <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139"

                                    that that Government can be destroyed only by the most drastic
                                    and positive measures; and that the Minister of War heads an
                                    opposition group, which believes that the same results can be
                                    more economically obtained by continuation of the “long duration
                                    war” policy through inevitably causing the economic and
                                    financial collapse of China. Our information as to the
                                    respective positions of the two leaders may be incorrect, but
                                    there appears to be little doubt but that the issue has
                                    arisen.</item>

                                <item>The political parties have repeatedly expressed to the Prime
                                    Minister desire for greater representation in the Cabinet. This
                                    is believed to be a matter which can be adjusted with not too
                                    great difficulty as the Ministry of Health is vacant and the
                                    Overseas Minister and the Minister of Agriculture, both close
                                    personal friends of the Prime Minister, are said to be willing
                                    to give way.</item>

                                <item>We understand that the present situation was precipitated by
                                    the Prime Minister expressing a desire to resign because of
                                    ill-health and other personal reasons (he has not been well for
                                    several years). He has apparently been persuaded to exclude such
                                    personal reasons in deciding his future course.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>As the position taken by the Minister of War with regard to
                                    the China conflict is presumably the considered position of the
                                    army, no improvement in the situation in the Cabinet can be
                                    expected were Sugiyama to be replaced by another general. It is
                                    our view, therefore, that the problem which Konoye must solve is
                                    whether (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) he should continue in office
                                    with the present Cabinet (not importantly reconstituted to
                                    include a few more representatives of the political parties) or
                                        (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) resign and thus make possible the
                                    organizing of a new and more united Cabinet. It is reported that
                                    on April 17 Konoye will send a messenger to Prince Saionji<note

                                opportunity might shortly occur for an offer of good offices by His
                                Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in order to bring the
                                hostilities in the Far East to a close. Mr. Eden explained to Mr.
                                Yoshida that it would be possible for His Majesty’s Government to
                                use their good offices except in conjunction with the Government of
                                the United States, and that in the light of the similarity of their
                                positions in the Far East, and the parallel action which they had
                                been taking, it would be only natural that His Majesty’s Government
                                should wish to approach the United States Government if any such
                                step were contemplated.</p>
                            <p>Commenting on Mr. Yoshida’s suggestion, His Majesty’s Ambassador at
                                    Tokyo<note n="18" xml:id="d147fn18">Sir Robert L.
                                    Craigie.</note> has expressed the opinion that if ever the time
                                arrives to offer good offices in the Sino-Japanese dispute there is
                                no doubt that combined Anglo-American action would be the best
                                course from every point of view. Sir Robert Craigie reports,
                                however, that he has recently received indications from one or two
                                well-informed quarters that public opinion in Japan is not likely to
                                welcome or even accept joint action by the United Kingdom and the
                                United States owing to the implications of pressure in so powerful a
                                combination. On the other hand he is told that influential opinion
                                is coming more and more to the view that when the right time comes
                                good offices by either the United States or Great Britain would be
                                the best and surest method of settling the dispute. But Sir Robert
                                Craigie does not at the present moment see any prospect of useful
                                intermediary action except in the improbable event of Marshal Chiang
                                Kai Shek being willing to retire in order to bring peace to his
                                country. He admits at the same time that the situation may change at
                                any moment.</p>
                            <p>As at present advised the feeling of His Majesty’s Government in the
                                United Kingdom is that although they would much prefer joint
                                mediation they should not definitely exclude the possibility of
                                mediation by one government, and that it is not of any great
                                importance whether that government be His Majesty’s Government or
                                the United States Government if the Japanese set any store by one
                                mediating rather than the other. They do, however, think that
                                whichever Government mediates should keep the other neutral
                                governments, including the German Government, reasonably well
                                informed of the progress of negotiations.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Sir Alexander</hi>: It was very
                                gratifying to me to have, through the British Embassy here, your
                                letter of February 14 and the memorandum enclosed therewith.</p>
                            <p>I had long been intending to write you, but, in the press of many
                                matters which have kept me more than busy since my return from
                                Brussels, I have failed thus far to carry out that good intention—
                                along with many other failures to perform.</p>
                            <p>Turning to the memorandum, I have noted carefully what you say in
                                explanation of the conception which it represents and I fully
                                understand that it does not commit your Government. I note
                                especially your expression of the view that a settlement on the
                                lines sketched cannot be expected unless our two Governments should
                                be able to exercise effective pressure to bring it about. With all
                                of that in mind, I have discussed the memorandum with some of my
                                closest associates, and, in the light of our discussion, we have put
                                on paper a record of discussion in the form of a memorandum which I
                                enclose herewith. As is the case with your memorandum, this
                                memorandum has not been seen by the highest policy-making officials
                                of my Government and does not commit them. It should in fact be
                                regarded as committing no one. However, it accurately reflects, its
                                authors believe, the spirit and the manner in which, in the light of
                                prevailing public opinion in this country, approach is made here to
                                the difficult problems inherent in and presented by current
                                developments in the situation under consideration. Much of what is
                                said is tentative, and all of it is unofficial. I realize, as will
                                you, that it does not offer much on the constructive side. More will
                                be possible, we hope, on that side, later.</p>
                            <p>I enclose, also, for your convenience of reference, the full text of
                                the most recent extended utterance of the Secretary of State on the

                                <p>(Note: The memorandum gives a tentative indication of the kind of
                                    settlement between Japan and China which its Foreign Office
                                    authors believe the British Government might consider
                                    reasonable. It has not been considered by the British Government
                                    and is not to be regarded as committing the British Government.
                                    Its authors are of the opinion that a settlement on the lines
                                    sketched in its paragraphs should be expected only in case the
                                    British and American Governments should be in position to
                                    exercise effective pressure toward bringing it about.)</p>
                                <p>1. The Foreign Office authors envisage action on parallel lines
                                    by the American Government and by the British Government. They
                                    are of the opinion that action toward restoration of peace in
                                    the Far East through machinery which might be set up <hi

                                    Nine Power Treaty would, under present world conditions, prove
                                    ineffective.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> The two Governments have been
                                    pursuing in regard to many matters in the Far East courses of
                                    action which run parallel. They have been doing this without
                                    mutual or reciprocal commitments and (when and where so doing)
                                    because their views, interests and objectives have been similar.
                                    The view now expressed by the Foreign Office authors that <hi
                                        rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> machinery would under present

                                    comments.</p>
                                <p>The Foreign Office authors feel that action along the lines thus
                                    far employed is not likely to cause Japan to abandon her present
                                    intention of destroying the Chinese Government and setting up in
                                    place thereof puppet régimes subservient to the will of
                                    Japan.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> We concur.</p>
                                <p>The Foreign Office authors feel that under such an arrangement
                                    all foreign interests would suffer serious injury and might in
                                    course of time find themselves excluded from China.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> We concur, but with emphasis on
                                    the word “might.”</p>
                                <p>The Foreign Office authors reason that if representations were
                                    backed by naval forces adequate to defend any vital British
                                    interest that might be affected, the attitude of the Japanese
                                    Government toward China would probably be considerably modified.
                                    They therefore approach the question of possible peace terms
                                    from this angle: assuming that the British Government should be
                                    in a position to enforce respect for vital British interests and
                                    thus dictate terms of peace, what should those terms be.</p>
                                <pb n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0147"/>
                                <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> We are not in position to make an
                                    assumption that the American Government would be in a position
                                    (that the United States would be willing) to make a disposal of
                                    naval forces for the purpose of defending and enforcing respect
                                    for American interests or of dictating terms of peace.
                                    Therefore, our approach to the question what the terms of peace
                                    should be (in fact, to the whole situation and its problems) is
                                    and must be from an angle different from that from which the
                                    Foreign Office authors have in this memorandum considered that
                                    question.</p>
                                <p>2. The Foreign Office authors envisage vital British interests in
                                    the Far East as being: (1) peace and stable political
                                    conditions, (2) the open door and equality of opportunity, and
                                    (3) the security of Hong Kong. They consider that if the first
                                    two of these were assured the third would be thereby taken care
                                    of. Hence, if the British Government were able to secure a peace
                                    on the basis of the first two, “every vital British interest
                                    would thereby be fully safeguarded and they might hope to secure
                                    the cooperation of other powers having substantial interests in
                                    the Far East in the attempt to secure such a settlement.” They
                                    hope that the United States Government would also be of the view
                                    that all that is necessary for the protection of American
                                    interests in the Far East is the due observance by all parties
                                    of the Nine Power Treaty, and that this Government would
                                    therefore be disposed to take action parallel to that of the
                                    British Government. They suggest that such action might take the
                                    form of making representations to Japan that American (British)
                                    interests are being damaged through the failure of Japan to live
                                    up to the provisions of Article 1 of the Nine Power Treaty, and
                                    of taking such measures as will indicate clearly that the United
                                    States (United Kingdom) Government does not intend to acquiesce
                                    in further breaching of the provisions of the treaty and making
                                    it clear that in the view of the United States (United Kingdom)
                                    Government the terms of settlement should be on the one hand
                                    fair to China and on the other hand fair and even generous to
                                    Japan.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Without attempting to distinguish
                                    between interests and vital interests, it is a well-known fact
                                    that this country is deeply concerned in regard and in relation
                                    to the questions of peace, stable political condition, open door
                                    and equality of opportunity, the world over; and that it is
                                    opposed to aggression and conquest and procedures of violence in
                                    international relations—everywhere, and therefore in the Far
                                    East. Hence, its objectives in regard to points 1 and 2 are
                                    similar to the British objectives; and, it would have an
                                    indirect concern in regard to point 3. This country of course
                                    desires that there be peace, stable conditions, an open door and
                                    equality of opportunity in China (and elsewhere) and that there
                                    be no aggression against <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0148"
                                    />the sovereignty or the territory of any power in the Far East
                                    (or elsewhere). The Government of the United States has
                                    repeatedly given indication of the importance which it attachés
                                    to and the value which it places upon the provisions of the Nine
                                    Power Treaty. However, the action which the British authors
                                    suggest toward obtaining respect by Japan for the provisions of
                                    that treaty calls for a disposal of naval forces, and, as stated
                                    above, it cannot be assumed that the United States is or will be
                                    willing to employ that method. Moreover, there is room for doubt
                                    whether an approach—to the problem of satisfactory terms of
                                    settlement within the limits of the Nine Power Treaty alone
                                    would be sufficiently broad to cover the needs of the
                                    situation.</p>

                                    delegations present, with some exceptions, reaffirmed the
                                    principles of the Nine Power Treaty and gave notice that the
                                    settlement ultimately made between Japan and China must be
                                    acceptable to the parties to that treaty. That action should
                                    ultimately have substantial influence upon the course of events
                                    in the Far East. But, both the Japanese and the Chinese realize
                                    that the fundamental issue in the present conflict is whether
                                    China (or large parts of China) is to be ruled by Chinese or by
                                    Japanese. It apparently is, as stated by the Foreign Office
                                    authors, the present intention of the Japanese to destroy the
                                    Chinese Government and to set up in place thereof puppet régimes
                                    “that would be completely subservient to the will of Japan.”
                                    There is warrant for believing that an objective of the Japanese
                                    is to gain complete control of China. In the light of those
                                    considerations, the Japanese insistence on their contention that
                                    the issues concern Japan and China exclusively and, also, their
                                    persistent refusal to give countenance to any intrusion by other
                                    powers are intelligible.</p>
                                <p>As matters stand, would a peace settlement brought about now by
                                    pressure from foreign governments with a threat of use of force
                                    be anything other than an uneasy, not-to-be-relied-upon, and
                                    short-lived truce?</p>
                                <p>With regard to the menace to the interests of foreign powers,
                                    while it is true that Japan is, in those areas which have been
                                    occupied by the Japanese Army, steadily undermining and
                                    whittling down the rights and interests of other powers, and
                                    while there is at all times an incidental menace to the lives
                                    and property of foreign nationals, does it not appear that both
                                    the Japanese and the Chinese are, and for some time to come will
                                    be, so completely occupied with problems of their military
                                    operations against each other as to render it unlikely that
                                    either power will go out of its way to add to its troubles by an
                                    officially planned armed assault upon the territorial or
                                    physical possessions <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0149"/>of
                                    a third power? If, however, one or more third powers were at the
                                    present time to dispose naval forces in a manner threatening to
                                    Japan, would not the likelihood of substantial assault by some
                                    Japanese armed forces upon territories or property of such power
                                    or powers be greatly increased? If such an assault were made,
                                    would not such power or powers at once—or soon—suffer injuries
                                    and incur losses greater in extent and in amount than would
                                    otherwise be those which they had sought—by making such a
                                    threat—to obviate? Suppose also that third powers were to bring
                                    to bear upon China a pressure directed toward causing China to
                                    compromise (at China’s expense) with Japan. Would not such a
                                    course be inconsistent with the treaty pledges of the powers?
                                    Leaving aside considerations of justice and of international
                                    morality, would a peace (?) agreement brought about now by such
                                    pressure in any way produce conditions of security, more than
                                    perhaps momentarily, for anything belonging to or appertaining
                                    to the powers and their interests?</p>
                                <p>Would any effort by third powers directed toward helping Japan to
                                    acquire control of any portion of Chinese territory bring any
                                    permanent advantage to any of such powers?</p>
                                <p>The situation and its potentialities being what they are, is not
                                    the policy which has thus far been pursued and which is now
                                    being pursued by the United States as sound a policy as can be
                                    pursued? In the course which it has followed, the Government of
                                    the United States at the outset urged upon both the Japanese and
                                    the Chinese Governments that hostilities be not entered upon; it
                                    thereafter urged upon both Governments that resort be had to
                                    processes of conciliation, and it assured both that it would be
                                    glad to be of assistance toward resort to such processes; it has
                                    throughout preserved an attitude of impartiality (“neutrality”)
                                    as between the parties; it has refrained from any action of
                                    interference or intervention; it has in effect taken note of
                                    impairments of American rights and injuries done to American
                                    interests by processes and instrumentalities of <hi
                                        rend="italic">force majeure</hi>, in some cases by Japanese
                                    and in some cases by Chinese agents; it has, however, refused to
                                    give any assent or countenance to such acts by either or both of
                                    the parties; it has made appropriate protests and entered
                                    appropriate reservations; it has notified both parties that it
                                    will hold them responsible for results of their unlawful acts;
                                    and it has taken steps toward strengthening and augmenting the
                                    armed forces of the United States, without adopting a menacing
                                    attitude or suggesting that it might use force for purposes of
                                    coercion. The Government of the United States took a definite
                                    stand in 1932 when it addressed to the Japanese and Chinese

                                    means contrary to the provisions of the Pact of Paris. This
                                    Government has during the current hostilities given no assent to
                                    violations of international law or of treaty provisions by
                                    either the Japanese or the Chinese. This Government and the
                                    American people perceive today no useful purpose that could be
                                    served, no lasting advantage that might be gained by
                                    facilitating or giving countenance to any acquisition by Japan
                                    of new rights, titles or privileges on the basis of armed
                                    conquest in China.</p>
                                <p>There would seem to be little warrant for an expectation that
                                    Japan can gain a clear military victory over China in the near
                                    future. Meanwhile, armament programs are being pushed both in
                                    the United States and in Great Britain, and in course of time it
                                    should become evident to Japan that she cannot both have her way
                                    in China and keep up in an armament race—if either—and that,
                                    because of relative changes in strength and of other
                                    developments in the general situation, her self-interest will be
                                    best served by her showing reasonable regard for the rights, the
                                    interests and the opinions of Great Britain and the United
                                    States and other concerned powers.</p>
                                <p>On the basis of these various considerations, it is believed that
                                    the most feasible course for the United States—and, if we may
                                    venture to suggest, for Great Britain—would be to persevere
                                    along these lines and await the coming of a time when it may
                                    appear that the Japanese and the Chinese have reached states of
                                    mind in the presence of which assistance toward the making by
                                    them of a reasonable settlement may to advantage be offered—and
                                    be given—from without.</p>
                                <p>Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Foreign Office memorandum contain
                                    suggestions regarding possible terms of a peace settlement. (It
                                    was stated in section 2 that the terms “besides being fair to
                                    China, should be fair and even generous to Japan.”)</p>
                                <p>3, 4 and 5. The Foreign Office authors express the view that
                                    arrangements for the future administration of Shanghai would
                                    seem to be the crux of the whole problem. They state that
                                    restoration as far as possible of the administration as it
                                    existed prior to July 1937 with possibly some improvements on
                                    the lines suggested in the Feetham Report would meet with
                                    certain difficulties because of the large number of Japanese
                                    nationals residing at Shanghai and the large amount of the
                                    Japanese share in the vested interests and foreign trade there.
                                    They speak of an inconsistency between certain provisions of the
                                    Nine Power Treaty and exclusion of Chinese authority from
                                    Shanghai. <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0151"/>They mention
                                    a traditional aim of American and British policy, that of
                                    encouraging China to develop into a modern state. They affirm
                                    that the United States and the United Kingdom will be reluctant
                                    in future to use force for protection of vested interests or
                                    maintenance of foreign municipal institutions there, whether
                                    against Chinese nationalism or against Japanese aggression. They
                                    feel that—in view of the uneasy situation which will persist if
                                    Japanese control is not eliminated from Shanghai and if foreign
                                    control should continue to impede the normal development of
                                    Shanghai—there are strong arguments in favor of making a radical
                                    change in the existing conditions at Shanghai. They suggest that
                                    a self-denying ordinance is called for, under which both Japan
                                    and other powers would abandon certain safeguards which have
                                    hitherto been regarded as indispensable for the protection of
                                    foreign interests there. They express the view that the
                                    alternative to maintaining the International Settlement by force
                                    is to restore complete Chinese control and that this need not
                                    mean the end of foreign participation in local municipal
                                    government. They suggest that on the withdrawal of the Japanese
                                    troops from Shanghai the Governments of the United States and
                                    the United Kingdom should use their influence to bring about the
                                    setting up by the Chinese Government of a single municipal
                                    authority for the whole of greater Shanghai; the municipal
                                    administration to contain a foreign element, with full
                                    representation of Japanese, British and other foreign interests;
                                    the police force to be unified, containing a foreign element;
                                    Chinese laws to be applied and the Chinese writ to run
                                    throughout; and no troops, Chinese or foreign, to be stationed,
                                    within a radius of, say, 30 miles, around Shanghai.</p>

                                    regard to Shanghai have a strong appeal. Our thoughts have been
                                    running along substantially those lines. It is believed that
                                    official opinion here would be favorably disposed in principle
                                    toward them. We feel, however, that the time has not yet arrived
                                    for a commitment—such as would be involved in the launching of
                                    any particular “plan”—regarding the future of Shanghai.</p>

                                    facilitate a settlement of other points and should connote
                                    withdrawal of Japanese armed forces from China and probably
                                    withdrawal of all foreign garrisons; that the Chinese would
                                    doubtless be willing to give assurances that the Maritime
                                    Customs Administration would be maintained on a basis of
                                    international cooperation fair to all powers trading in the Far
                                    East; and that China might be pressed to give satisfaction to
                                    Japan on a number of points such as anti-Japanese teaching in
                                    school textbooks, the suppression of anti-Japanese propaganda,
                                    and the tariff rates to be applied to Japanese trade.</p>

                                    China and the granting of special facilities for economic
                                    cooperation and for the investment of Japanese capital in north
                                    China, including perhaps mining and industrial concessions for
                                    Japanese corporations, and some measure of Japanese
                                    participation in the management of railways in north China. They
                                    indicate, also, that if opportunity should occur for dealing
                                    with the question of extraterritoriality, British officialdom
                                    would favor a solution on the lines of the draft agreement of
                                    1931 modified by the rendition of the International Settlement

                                    whether recognition of “Manchukuo” by China really would “remove
                                    one of the irritants that tend to disturb international
                                    relations generally.” Such recognition (followed by recognition
                                    of “Manchukuo” by other countries) might conceivably operate as
                                    a palliative, but would it in any way go to the root of any of
                                    the causes of conflict which disturb the relations of Japan,
                                    China and the Soviet Union? Its one assured effect would be to
                                    confirm the confidence of the Japanese in the efficacy of the
                                    method which they have been following, that of using armed
                                    force, in pursuance of objectives of policy. And this
                                    development in the Far East would inevitably encourage other
                                    powers which have the inclination to employ or to persevere in
                                    employment of that method in other parts of the world. It is not
                                    believed in the United States that “Manchukuo” possesses the
                                    characteristics of a sovereign and independent state. It must be
                                    assumed that this country would not wish to take, to participate
                                    in or to be associated with any initiative toward persuading the
                                    Chinese to accord the recognition under reference.</p>
                                <p>With regard to the suggestion that the terms of peace might

                                    China,” it is, of course, highly desirable that there be
                                    economic cooperation between the Chinese and the Japanese. By
                                    virtue of her geographic position and of the fact that she has

                                    countries, Japan enjoys in China and in other Far Eastern
                                    markets certain definite “natural” advantages. Measures should
                                        <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0153"/>be devised whereby
                                    the Japanese may reside in, do business in, and trade with China
                                    under conditions of safety and of non-discrimination. But, is
                                    there reason why the Japanese should be accorded (by any
                                    political action) a preferred position there? Would it not seem
                                    that only when and as Chinese nationals and Japanese nationals
                                    arrive at a common conception that mutual and reciprocal
                                    advantages are to be had through amicable economic cooperation
                                    between them will there exist a basis for successful carrying
                                    out of joint or cooperative Chinese-Japanese undertakings? Can
                                    any agreements toward that end to which Chinese authorities
                                    might commit China under conditions of duress, if giving the
                                    Japanese any “special” position, have beneficial effects of any
                                    long duration? In the past, the Chinese authorities have on many
                                    occasions found it expedient under conditions of duress to enter
                                    into agreements according special rights (“privileges”) to
                                    foreign countries and their nationals. However, the
                                    circumstances antecedent and the situations prevailing when such
                                    agreements were concluded have never been, generally speaking,
                                    such as those which prevail in connection with the present
                                    Japanese-Chinese conflict. Never have the issues been such as
                                    are the issues, between Japan and China, today. The questions of
                                    Japanese penetration and of Japanese influence in and over China
                                    are questions of vital concern to the Chinese. The question
                                    whether foreign governments should bring to bear any substantial
                                    measure of influence or pressure toward bringing about the
                                    conclusion of an agreement which would accord to the Japanese
                                    special rights, privileges, or advantages in north China
                                    differing in any way from those accorded to China (and others)
                                    in Japanese territories or from those enjoyed by other powers in
                                    north China, is a question answer to which can be given to
                                    advantage only in the light of most serious and extensive
                                    consideration of the many implications and the various possible
                                    consequences of such a procedure.</p>
                                <p>The suggestion that there should be mining and industrial
                                    concessions for Japanese corporations seems on its face
                                    reasonable and meritorious. However, there at once arise the
                                    questions: Circumstances being what they are, would Japan enter
                                    into any such agreements on a reciprocal basis; would China
                                    derive any real benefit therefrom; and what would be the results
                                    in terms of harmony or of friction?</p>
                                <p>The suggestion that there should be some measure of Japanese
                                    participation in and management of the northern railways raises
                                    the questions: What, in the event of such a development, would
                                    become of the already established interests of other countries,
                                    conspicuously those of Great Britain, France, and Belgium, in
                                    the northern railways; and would such a measure be consistent
                                    with certain provisions of <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150"
                                        facs="0154"/>existing treaties and contracts, and with
                                    certain features of China’s national policy?</p>
                                <p>With regard to the broad general subject of Chinese-Japanese
                                    cooperation, the question arises: Does the evidence afforded by
                                    observation of what has taken place in the areas in which
                                    conditions have been theoretically favorable to Chinese-Japanese
                                    cooperation (the Kwan-tung Leased Territory, south Manchuria,
                                    and since 1931 all of Manchuria) give warrant for an expectation
                                    that such cooperation would be attainable in fact in north
                                    China? Over the period of the past thirty-three years the
                                    Kwantung Leased Territory might with warrant be viewed as having
                                    afforded a laboratory for testing the practicability of
                                    Chinese-Japanese cooperation, and, viewed in this light, the
                                    results of the test would seem to afford little basis for an
                                    answer in the affirmative. With the factors of a Japanese
                                    administration, an industrious Chinese population, abundant
                                    natural resources, and an adequacy of available capital, there
                                    has not been produced any real economic cooperation or any
                                    substantial collaboration of any kind. Much the same may be said
                                    also regarding south Manchuria, where Japanese influence has
                                    been predominant for twenty-three years, and regarding
                                    “Manchukuo,” where the Japanese have been in control since 1931.
                                    In “Manchukuo” not only has there been little or no genuine
                                    Chinese-Japanese economic cooperation but economic developments
                                    have been kept subservient to political and military objectives,
                                    and there has been afforded little or no opportunity for private
                                    Chinese participation (as distinguished from “Manchukuo”
                                    government participation) or for foreign participation. In the
                                    light of these facts, can it be assumed that Chinese-Japanese
                                    economic cooperation in north China would be realizable—or would
                                    eventuate? Might it not more warrantably be expected that

                                    investment in north China, if and when, would contribute toward
                                    creating in north China a situation in all essential respects
                                    similar to the situation in Manchuria? The difficulty which the
                                    Chinese find in cooperating, even among themselves, is well
                                    known. Also well known are the rigidity of form, of national
                                    consciousness, and of political influences which characterize
                                    and accompany Japanese official and economic activities. To
                                    these factors, there has been added during recent years the
                                    factor of intense reciprocal distrust and antipathy. These
                                    observations and queries need not imply criticism either of the
                                    Japanese or of the Chinese. They do, however, give rise to a
                                    further question: Is effective Chinese-Japanese cooperation
                                    possible?</p>
                                <p>In general, does not observation of Japanese penetration into
                                    areas populated by Chinese lead to the conclusions: (1) that,
                                    where there is close contact between Japanese and Chinese,
                                    conflict rather than cooperation develops; (2) that Japanese
                                    economic effort in China <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0155"
                                    />relies heavily upon Japanese official support; (3) that such
                                    effort when and where engaged in tends toward subordination or
                                    exclusion of the Chinese interests; and (4) that in areas in
                                    which such effort is successful, American and European interests
                                    also are gradually and effectively excluded?</p>

                                    the draft agreement of 1931, with modification in the direction
                                    desired by China in regard especially to the rendition of the
                                    International Settlement as discussed in an earlier section of
                                    these authors’ memorandum, is altogether in line with views
                                    which have for some time past been those in principle of the
                                    American Government.</p>
                                <p><hi rend="italic">Additional Comment:</hi> The contention is
                                    often made that the United States maintains an attitude and
                                    follows courses in regard to Far Eastern problems which are
                                    unduly “idealistic” and not closely enough responsive to
                                    “realities.” Without going into a discussion of the question:
                                    What constitutes realism in relation to the situation in and the
                                    problems of the Far East?—it is our belief that the approach
                                    which the Government of the United States makes to the problems
                                    involved is in fact definitely and conspicuously realistic.</p>
                                <p>During the century of increasingly close contact between the
                                    occidental powers and China which preceded the Washington
                                    Conference, the occidental powers made trial of and had
                                    experience of a great variety of methods of approach. Against
                                    the background of experience, and in the light of serious and
                                    careful consideration of existing situations and existing trends
                                    of thought in various parts of the world, the powers concluded,
                                    at Washington, under the leadership of the American and the
                                    British Governments, a collection of agreements which were
                                    intended to diminish frictions, regulate contacts, and eliminate
                                    some at least of the factors which were making for international
                                    conflict—especially in the Far East and the Pacific. Whatever
                                    may have been the inadequacies and the deficiencies of those
                                    agreements, the provisions of one of them, the Nine Power
                                    Treaty, constitute, in our opinion, a sound basis for the
                                    regulation of the activities of the powers, including Japan, in
                                    China and in relations with China. Although there has been
                                    during recent years much criticism of that treaty and much
                                    contention from some quarters that the treaty either is defunct
                                    or is obsolete, from no source has <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152"
                                        facs="0156"/>there come any proffer of a better set of
                                    principles and provisions which might be agreed upon by the
                                    powers for the furthering of the objectives which were sought to
                                    be attained by commitment of the powers to (and respect—were it
                                    given—by the powers for) the provisions of that treaty. The
                                    treaty was based on the assumption that the Chinese people would
                                    be capable, if not subjected to unwarranted molestation, of
                                    working out by their own methods and their own efforts a new
                                    political organization and an economic reorganization which
                                    would contribute toward conditions of stability and peace within
                                    their country and in the Far East. The American people still
                                    feel that the assumption under reference was (and is) sound. The
                                    Government of the United States believes that, generally
                                    speaking, the provisions of the Nine Power Treaty are fair and
                                    susceptible of practical application. It therefore seems to us
                                    that the fundamental problem in connection with China and Japan
                                    (and the relations of the powers with and in China) is that of
                                    bringing about a realization by Japan that relations between
                                    Japan and China must conform to the general principles which
                                    have been evolved in world experience for the regulation of
                                    relations between sovereign and independent states; realization
                                    by Japan that neither the Chinese people nor the peoples of
                                    other countries which have interests in the Far East are capable
                                    of becoming reconciled to a domination by Japan of China;
                                    realization by the Japanese that other powers not only have
                                    rights in and with regard to China but are incapable of
                                    relinquishing some of those rights; realization by Japan that
                                    conquest of China by force of arms is expressly forbidden by
                                    international legislation, in the form of multilateral treaties,
                                    enacted during recent decades; realization by Japan that,
                                    whatever may be her immediate success in use of armed force,
                                    several other nations, including the Chinese, have greater
                                    resources and power of endurance than has Japan; realization, in
                                    short, by the Japanese that principles, interests, law, treaty
                                    provisions, and the public opinion of many countries too
                                    powerful to be disregarded in the long run are opposed to
                                    Japan’s present policies and methods in regard to China, and
                                    that it therefore is advisable that the Japanese themselves
                                    revise both of these.</p>
                                <p>Such evidence as we have gives no indication that there is
                                    imminent a breakdown either of China or of Japan. Nor have we
                                    any indication that the Chinese are at this time eager to enter
                                    upon any negotiation the objective of which would be a
                                    settlement favorable to Japan at the expense of China. Attempts
                                    at mediation have already been made by an official
                                    representative of at least one power. Suggestions which that
                                    representative made to the Chinese apparently with the approval
                                    of the Japanese, have been rejected by the Chinese. The efforts
                                    of the Brussels Conference to bring about a negotiation were <pb
                                        n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0157"/>rejected by the
                                    Japanese. The Conference is on record in reaffirmation of the
                                    principles of the Nine Power Treaty and in affirmation that the
                                    settlement between Japan and China when made must be acceptable
                                    to the powers party to the Nine Power Treaty which they
                                    represented. At the present moment no settlement acceptable to
                                    the Chinese would be likely to be acceptable to the Japanese—and
                                    vice versa.</p>
                                <p>In the light of the above, we feel that the time has not yet come
                                    when it would be opportune for the American Government or for
                                    the British Government or for these two Governments or for any
                                    group of governments to put forward a suggested plan of
                                    settlement. It seems to us advisable to withhold such a step
                                    until both the Japanese and the Chinese shall have reached a
                                    state of mind more favorable to a disposition on their part to
                                    take into consideration what we believe to be the realities
                                    which underlie the whole situation and which sooner or later
                                    must be faced. Is there not warrant for an expectation that, as
                                    the situation in China further develops, the Japanese will come
                                    to a realization that the cost of a perseverance by them in
                                    their effort to conquer China will be greater than such a
                                    conquest, if achievable at all, could possibly be worth to them;
                                    and that in the interval they will, as a result of
                                    representations made by other governments and in the light of
                                    developments in the fields of public opinion and of military
                                    preparedness in other countries, tend to show increasingly
                                    greater respect for the rights and interests of third
                                    powers?</p>

                                Peiping and says that areas south of and to within sight of walls of
                                Peiping are roused in opposition. Colonel Stilwell has returned from
                                a trip to the northwest which took him to Sining in Chinghai, and
                                tells me that throughout area which he traveled the people are being
                                drilled and aroused. More recently Captain Carlson has returned from
                                a trip which enabled him to watch 3 days of the fighting at
                                Taierchuang, and tells me that Chinese troops in the field there won
                                a well deserved victory over Japanese troops, administering the
                                first defeat that Japanese troops have suffered in the field in
                                modern times. All of this confirms my belief that Japan will have to
                                use a great deal more force than it now has in the field if it hopes
                                to pacify and begin reconstruction operations even in those areas
                                close to Shanghai and Tientsin.</p>

                                <item>Conditions here at Hankow have changed from an atmosphere of
                                    pessimism to one of dogged optimism. The Government is more
                                    united under Chiang and there is a feeling that the future is
                                    not entirely hopeless due to recent failure of Japanese arms at
                                    Hsuchow. This optimism is based more upon the hope of wearing
                                    out the Japanese than any expectation of being able by force to
                                    drive out Japanese forces now on Chinese soil. Realization of
                                    this hope is dependent upon the Japanese economic factor which
                                    is a highly speculative quantity. Chinese ability to maintain a
                                    stubborn long time resistance is fairly good, as the Chinese can
                                    feed themselves indefinitely while Japanese forces in China will
                                    have to be supplied continually at colossal expense.</item>

                                <item>I find no evidence of a desire for a peace by compromise among
                                    Chinese, and doubt whether the Government could persuade its
                                    army or its people to accept such a peace. The spirit of
                                    resistance is slowly spreading among the people, who are
                                    awakening to a feeling that this is their war. Japanese air
                                    raids in the interior and atrocities by Japanese soldiers upon
                                    civilian population are responsible for this stiffening of the

                                informal conversation with British Ambassador on April 24 in the
                                course of which latter expressed admiration for spirit of resistance
                                which Chinese are showing and hope for their eventual success. He
                                commented upon difference in viewpoint in this respect which he had
                                achieved since coming to Hankow and stated that he expected to make
                                this place his headquarters. He stated that he had arranged with the
                                Chinese and hoped to make similar arrangements with Japanese for use
                                of a British plane to enable him to travel between Shanghai and
                                Hankow. British Ambassador said he had informed Donald<note n="32"

                                McHugh to infer that such financial circles might find it possible
                                to extend additional credits to China provided that Soong is
                                disposed to assume office as Financial Minister, but stated that he
                                would not intervene actively with Chinese in behalf of Soong.</p>
                            <p>Later on same day McHugh had lunch with Soong who informed him that
                                British Ambassador had urged him quite frankly to iron out his
                                difficulties with Generalissimo and resume office. Soong was
                                apparently pleased with what he described as British Sahib’s amazing
                                directness on short acquaintance and stated that he had seen the
                                Generalissimo and had informed him of his willingness to assist in
                                any way possible. He told McHugh that he would not ask for any
                                office and would return only if invited.</p>
                            <p>The morning of April 25 Donald told McHugh that Kung had submitted
                                his resignation to the Generalissimo.</p>
                            <p>This morning Donald informed McHugh that Soong offered to return to
                                Ministry of Finance on conditions which were unacceptable to the
                                Generalissimo who has now refused to accept the resignation of Kung.
                                Chiang was quoted as saying that he could not possibly work with
                                Soong and that if his failure to do so meant the forfeiture of
                                foreign assistance he would accept this fact and continue to fight
                                the enemy without such assistance.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to submit the
                                following summary of the activities of the Extraordinary National
                                Congress of the Kuomintang which was held in Hankow March 29 to
                                April 1, 1938.</p>
                            <p>The Congress was according to announcements called to deal with the
                                many important questions arising out of the Sino-Japanese
                                hostilities. Since the beginning of the hostilities the powers of
                                government have been intrusted to a supreme war council which has
                                been superimposed upon the regular governmental departments. This
                                organization with General Chiang Kai-shek at its head did not derive
                                its power directly from the Kuomintang but was born of necessity,
                                and created by strong-arm methods without the sanction of any
                                recognized responsible representative body. It is dictatorial and
                                military in character and derives its justification for existence
                                solely from the force of circumstances. The creation of this supreme
                                war council has, of course, robbed the Kuomintang of much of its
                                power over the National Government, which prior to the formation of
                                the council was the tool of the Party.</p>
                            <p>Prior to the convocation of the Extraordinary Congress there was
                                considerable speculation as to how the Party would take this
                                curtailment of its powers. It was therefore gratifying to many to
                                find that the Congress was prepared to accept in good spirit the
                                Party’s loss of prestige and to swim with the tide of popular
                                opinion in its will to unite all factions within the country in the
                                primary objective of continuing and strengthening resistance to
                                Japanese aggression.</p>
                            <p>Probably the most important action of the Congress was its unanimous
                                election of General Chiang Kai-shek to the post of Tsungtai
                                (Director General). By this action the Kuomintang in effect gave
                                public legal sanction to the dictatorship of General Chiang. Dr.
                                Wang Ching-wei was simultaneously given the post of Deputy
                                Tsungtai.</p>
                            <p>Among the numerous resolutions adopted by the Congress were
                                resolutions to further the cause of resistance by means of a foreign
                                policy designed to strengthen the friendly relations of China with
                                those powers seeking international peace and standing for the
                                sanctity of international agreements. Other resolutions dealt with
                                the furthering of mass military training, the improvement and
                                simplification of political administration within the nation, the
                                realigning of the nation’s economic and financial structure in order
                                to make possible the exertion of all energies in the cause of
                                resistance, and the mobilization <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159"
                                    facs="0163"/>of the masses through education into a united front
                                against Japan.</p>
                            <p>As an indication of the Party’s willingness to forego its dictatorial
                                powers over the Central Government, the Congress adopted a
                                resolution calling for the creation of a Peoples’ Political Council
                                which apparently is intended to extend beyond the bounds of the
                                Kuomintang and which will be vested with considerable power. This
                                council will, it is presumed, serve as the forum for the so-called
                                united front.</p>
                            <p>At its final meeting on April 1 the Congress adopted a long manifesto
                                which appeared in translation in the English language press. A copy
                                of the press translation is enclosed<note n="36" xml:id="d154fn36"

                                attitude of the Congress.</p>
                            <p>The manifesto points out that China has consistently striven for
                                peace with honor; the maintenance of its territorial integrity and
                                sovereign rights. When Japanese aggression became unbearable,
                                however, China was forced to fight and it must now continue the
                                struggle to the bitter end. Victory, when it is won, will mean not
                                only the preservation of China’s territorial integrity, but also
                                gain for it equality and freedom in the family of nations. The
                                manifesto points out that the only peace which China can accept is a
                                peace based upon justice. Any peace resulting from a compromise will
                                be tantamount to complete surrender to Japan, therefore, the
                                struggle must be carried through to the very end.</p>
                            <p>With reference to foreign policy the manifesto reiterates China’s
                                determination to respect its international agreements and to
                                continue and increase its efforts to maintain friendly relations
                                with other powers. It points to the fact that China is fighting for
                                world peace and the sanctity of international agreements. This fact
                                it maintains must be impressed upon the world. It bemoans the fact
                                that while China has the sympathy of the world it has failed to
                                receive any active support from the powers.</p>
                            <p>With respect to domestic policy the manifesto stresses the point that
                                the task of national reconstruction undertaken by the Central
                                Government must not be side-tracked or permitted to lag because of
                                the present hostilities. It maintains that the task of national
                                reconstruction and the stemming of Japanese aggression are
                                synonymous; that only through the revitalization and solidification
                                of the nation can the aggressors be repelled; and that, therefore,
                                it is imperative that all energies be directed simultaneously to the
                                resistance of aggression by military force and the reconstruction,
                                unification and strengthening of the nation.</p>
                            <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0164"/>
                            <p>The manifesto stresses the necessity for the fostering of a spirit of
                                nationalism in China. It points out that the Japanese have used as a
                                slogan in their propaganda campaign in China the catch phrase “self
                                determination” meaning that the various racial groups within China
                                should have the right of self government. This the manifesto says is
                                a hoax. It asserts that all groups in China are equally threatened
                                by the Japanese and that only by uniting and fighting together can
                                these various groups within the nation insure their freedom and make
                                possible the enjoyment of that freedom within the Republic of China
                                which the Kuomintang has guaranteed to all races.</p>
                            <p>While granting that political freedom is indeed a valuable
                                possession, the manifesto goes on to demonstrate that only through
                                wholehearted cooperation and through the subordination of the will
                                and desires of individuals to the will of the state can China hope
                                to achieve sufficient unity and strength to resist the aggressors.
                                It maintains that political freedom must, therefore, for the time
                                being be limited and that all political factions must work together
                                under a centralized control in order to present a united front
                                against the enemy.</p>
                            <p>The manifesto draws attention to the path that Japanese activities
                                have followed within the areas that have been occupied by the
                                Japanese military. It asserts that Japan’s primary objective is to
                                destroy China’s rapidly growing industries; that Japan seeks to
                                conquer China in order to be able to force it into a position where
                                it will function as a perpetual supplier of raw materials for
                                Japan’s industries while serving at the same time as an ever growing
                                market for Japan’s manufactured goods.</p>
                            <p>The manifesto states that while every effort must be made to improve
                                the lot of China’s vast agrarian population, at the same time no
                                effort should be spared in the endeavor to foster, protect and
                                promote those very industries which Japan is endeavoring to destroy.
                                Upon them to a large extent depends the success with which China
                                will be able to meet Japan’s onslaught. In this connection the
                                manifesto lays clown three cardinal principles which should serve as
                                the guide posts of the nation in its efforts to promote
                                industrialization.</p>

                                <item>The interests of the state should always be made paramount to
                                    those of the individual, and all efforts at reconstruction
                                    should follow this line.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The government should take over those industries which are
                                    essential to the welfare of the state and operate them for the
                                    common good.</item>
                            </list>
                            <p>In its final paragraphs the manifesto exhorts all members of the
                                Kuomintang to realize their responsibility as leaders of the nation
                                and <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0165"/>to put forth every
                                effort in the struggle for national salvation. It goes on to point
                                out that all patriotic citizens of China have, despite widely
                                divergent political views, rallied behind the Government in
                                resisting Japan, and it maintains that if, and only if, the people
                                continue to work together in a spirit of self-sacrifice, China will
                                win.</p>
                            <p>The Kuomintang Congress only echoed the general trend which is being
                                displayed throughout China to forget internal difficulties and
                                dissension in an effort to cope with the paramount issue, Japanese
                                aggression. Japan by its military invasion of China has succeeded in
                                accomplishing in China that which no Chinese leader has been able to
                                accomplish; stir the people up to a fighting pitch, instil in them
                                the idea of China as a united nation, and give them a rallying point
                                which, has universal appeal and is strong enough to force them to
                                abandon their factional differences and personal animosities. The
                                struggle against Japan is no longer the struggle of the Government
                                leaders—it is the people’s struggle. The Japanese military by their
                                brutal actions in the areas which have been occupied by Japanese
                                troops and by their air bombing of cities far in the interior have
                                worked up in the Chinese common people a hatred against Japan which
                                will be slow indeed in burning out. Should China succeed in its
                                present struggle against Japan it must certainly emerge a much
                                stronger and more unified nation.</p>
                            <p>Moreover the tone of hopefulness expressed in the manifesto is not
                                mere bravado. The Chinese are coming to feel that their troops,
                                though not as well equipped as the Japanese, are a fair match for
                                the aggressors, and they are sanguine of being able, by forcing
                                Japan to drive deeper and deeper into China, finally to cause the
                                collapse of Japan.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                                    <item>The Soviet Government on April 25 stated in reply that it
                                        had not included among its proposals any relating to basic
                                        policy but only such especially annoying ones as were
                                        susceptible of immediate solution; that the fisheries matter
                                        was not urgent and that the closing of the two Japanese
                                        Consulates above referred to was a matter of policy. While
                                        holding Japan ultimately responsible for the matters
                                        relating to Manchuria the Soviet Government then took them
                                        up at Hsinking and is now awaiting a definite reply from the
                                        Japanese Government before defining its views concerning
                                        Japanese requests relating to Sakhalin concessions.</item>

                            <p>2. It is apparent that the number of annoying incidents which have
                                arisen between the two Governments during the last 3 months have
                                been due in a large measure to retaliation, counter retaliation, and
                                jockeying for position. None seems to be more grave than numerous
                                incidents which have taken place in the past.</p>

                                    announcing his intention to assume again his official duties.
                                    This statement was generally construed as an announcement that
                                    the differences of opinion within the Cabinet have been in some

                                    will be prosecuted hereafter more vigorously than they have in

                            <p>602. Wang Keh Min, who has been in Shanghai for several days, flew to
                                Tokyo yesterday morning accompanied by Major General Kita. Wang was
                                shown every courtesy by high Japanese military and civil officials
                                here who took extraordinary precautions for his safety. The Japanese
                                Embassy spokesman denied the report that Wang’s position is
                                insecure. While here Wang saw Liang Hung Chih of the so-called
                                “Reformed Government” and according to Japanese press reports
                                reached a complete understanding regarding the merger of the two
                                puppet governments. It is also reported to have been agreed to
                                equally divide the customs revenues. A further Japanese report
                                states that Li Chao Nan has been appointed Superintendent of Customs
                                at Shanghai by the so-called “Reformed Government”.</p>

                                conclusion had been reached that mediation was out of the question
                                as there was no basis upon which mediation could be profitably
                                offered to either side.</p>

                                resistance of the Chinese to the Japanese was a magnificent and
                                heartening example of courage and patriotism. As soon as he had
                                become Prime Minister he had given orders to the French authorities
                                in Indo-China to open the railroad completely to all shipments of
                                planes and munitions to China. The Japanese had protested frequently
                                and vigorously, and a Japanese Consul in Indo-China had gone so far
                                as to say to the French General there that if the shipment of
                                munitions through Indo-China should not be stopped Japan might have
                                to make war. The French General had replied: “Come on and see what
                                happens to you!” This had produced a very salutary effect. The
                                Japanese Consul had left at once for Japan and had not returned.</p>

                                yesterday and in the course of a long conversation made the
                                following statements:</p>
                            <p>He was confident that China could continue to resist Japan for
                                another year at least. In England there had been talk of mediation.
                                He believed that no offer of mediation at the present time could
                                have any chance of success but thought that by the end of another 12
                                months the Japanese would find themselves in such difficulties that
                                they would be seeking mediation by England and the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>As a result of his lengthy visit to England he had the impression
                                that while the British did not desire to see Japan overwhelm China,
                                they also did not desire to see Japan defeated because they feared
                                that the defeat of Japan would mean the domination of China by the
                                    <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0169"/>Soviet Union. He
                                asserted that the Chinese Communist leaders were now cooperating in
                                full loyalty with Chiang Kai Shek and expressed the opinion that the
                                Chinese Communists were Chinese patriots first and Communists
                                second. There was no danger of communism in China.</p>
                            <p>He said that the Russians had furnished China with munitions to date
                                costing approximately 150,000,000 Chinese dollars. They had not
                                asked China for any payments on these purchases and indeed had
                                shipped some of the munitions even before China had promised to pay
                                for them. The road across Sinkiang had been kept open all winter by
                                an army of snow shovelers. There were 175,000 coolies working now on
                                the road from Burma into the interior of China and he could assure
                                me that within 2 months this road would be capable of bearing not
                                merely light supplies but also trucks carrying planes and the
                                heaviest cannon.</p>
                            <p>Sun Fo said that the chief worry of his Government at the moment was
                                the position of the currency. China did not need money for the
                                purchase of war supplies but a currency stabilization loan or some
                                other form of assistance for the stabilization of Chinese currency
                                would be of immense help. He asked me if I thought there was any
                                possibility of the Chinese Government obtaining assistance from the
                                Government of the United States or from private American financial
                                interests for this purpose. I said that I could not pretend to be
                                sufficiently conversant with the subject to give him an
                                authoritative answer but that it was my decided impression that the
                                Government of the United States had no funds which could be used for
                                this purpose and that it seemed unlikely that private bankers would
                                be interested.</p>
                            <p>Sun Fo is leaving tomorrow for China via Moscow. He described to me
                                in detail the 6-hour conversation he had with Stalin on his recent
                                visit to Moscow. He said that Stalin had assured him that he knew
                                that China was fighting Russia’s battle as well as her own; that it
                                was the ultimate objective of the Japanese to capture the whole of
                                Siberia as far as Lake Baikal; that China would continue to receive
                                all possible assistance from Russia in the form of munitions,
                                airplanes and other supplies; that the Soviet Union would not,
                                however, intervene militarily in the war. Stalin was apprehensive
                                that Germany might attack the Soviet Union if the Soviet Union
                                should make war on Japan. Stalin also felt that neither Great
                                Britain nor the United States would permit Japan to be crushed by
                                the Soviet Union.</p>

                            <p>During the course of a call Mr. Cressy outlined to me some of the
                                difficulties with which American mission and educational
                                institutions were confronted as a result of the present situation in
                                China.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Cressy said that while in Tokyo en route to the United States he
                                had talked with Mr. Horinouchi, Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs,
                                and that during the conversation Mr. Horinouchi had intimated that
                                the time might be ripe for mediation in the Sino-Japanese conflict
                                by a friendly power. Mr. Cressy said that he had reported this
                                remark to Ambassador Grew and that Ambassador Grew had asked Mr.
                                Cressy to communicate the remark to the Department. Mr. Cressy said
                                that he was now doing that.</p>
                            <p>At an earlier point in the conversation Mr. Cressy had remarked that
                                as the situation now stood there was no course open to China but to
                                continue to fight. I referred to that remark and said that it was
                                very difficult for me to conceive of any terms of peace which would
                                be mutually acceptable to both China and Japan. Mr. Cressy stated
                                that he concurred and that in his opinion, much as he deplored the
                                fighting, the fighting must continue for a further period before
                                there would be any practical basis for peace.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Cressy said that the suggestion had been made to him by Japanese
                                in Japan that it might be useful for a small representative group of
                                Japanese Christians to meet with a similar group of Chinese to see
                                whether they could bring about a better understanding of their
                                respective positions to the end that they might possibly formulate a
                                program for bringing about peace between the two countries. Mr.
                                Cressy said that he realized that there was only one chance in a
                                thousand of such a meeting bringing about the desired end but that
                                he was inclined to favor the bringing together of such a
                                Chinese-Japanese group. He said that the Chinese and Japanese chosen
                                would be responsible individuals who, although private citizens, had
                                ready access to governmental persons. Mr. Cressy asked me what I
                                thought of this project. I inquired whether the meeting would be
                                attended solely by Chinese and Japanese or whether Americans would
                                be involved. He said that possibly one American, perhaps himself,
                                might undertake the arrangement of such a meeting but that the
                                meeting as such would be essentially between the Chinese and
                                Japanese. I said that in regard to an American private citizen
                                becoming involved in any matter which might smack of mediation, the
                                Department had of course very definite <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167"
                                    facs="0171"/>views to the general effect that such activity on
                                the part of an American citizen was inappropriate and the question
                                of mediation could best be handled through normal diplomatic
                                channels. I said that from Mr. Cressy’s description of the project I
                                judged that it was essentially a meeting between Japanese and
                                Chinese private citizens and that I could see no objection to such a
                                meeting. I added that, speaking personally, I agreed with a previous
                                remark made by him that meetings between such Chinese and Japanese
                                groups might possibly tend to bring about better understanding and
                                appreciation on the part of each of the other’s point of view and
                                might therefore be constructive in results.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that,
                                according to the local papers of May 9, a committee which has been
                                studying the problem of coordination within the Government of
                                conduct of foreign relations, has recommended a drastic
                                reorganization of the Foreign Office. As the recommendations of the
                                committee have not as yet been made public, a discussion of the
                                changes proposed in detailed terms would be premature, but it is
                                understood that the present East Asia Bureau and the Intelligence
                                (Press) Section will be converted into quasi-independent agencies of
                                the Government, but placed under the direction of the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs. The present business of the Foreign Office, other
                                than that now handled by the above-mentioned offices, is to be
                                redistributed between four geographical bureaus (Eastern European,
                                Western European, American and South Seas) and the Treaty Bureau and
                                the Commercial Bureau. The Ministry is to be redesignated as the
                                Ministry of Foreign Policy.</p>
                            <p>The proposed changes do not reflect merely the desire to improve the
                                efficiency and effectiveness of the Foreign Office. The tide of
                                nationalism, which is being manifested toward government by a
                                directive organization instead of by personal leadership, has now
                                caught the Foreign Office. There is growing opposition to the
                                conduct of foreign relations by a small group of professional
                                diplomats, whose training and experiences tend to develop an
                                attitude of liberalism, and growing insistence that foreign
                                intercourse be based on that “immutable policy toward China” which
                                is now being implemented by the armed services.</p>
                            <p>Criticism of the “weak-kneed diplomacy” of the Japanese Foreign
                                Office has been the stock in trade of the reactionaries ever since
                                the Foreign Office was instituted, but such criticism has been
                                especially vehement since the outbreak of the Manchurian conflict in
                                1931. There has been a prevailing belief for some time that the
                                professional <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0173"/>diplomats have
                                not shown a disposition to make a positive contribution toward
                                setting up a foreign policy program unfettered by international
                                commitments calculated largely to preserve the rights in the Far
                                East of Occidental powers. This feeling bore fruit during the last
                                session of the Diet in a plan put forward by the Bureau of
                                Legislation, one of the offices placed under the Prime Minister, to
                                set up an independent agency of the Japanese Government where there
                                would be centralized control over all Japan’s interests in China,
                                including the conduct of relations with China and the development of
                                economic interests in that country. The Foreign Office took strong
                                exception to this plan, on the ground that relations with China
                                needed to be conducted with reference to Japan’s relations with
                                other countries and in the light of conditions existing in other
                                parts of the world—that to isolate China relations would lead to
                                complete confusion. It seemed as if the matter had there ended,
                                especially when provision was made for the establishment of two
                                organizations for the economic development of North China and
                                Central China, respectively. However, whether the Foreign Office
                                promised to make a counter proposal to the Bureau of Legislation, or
                                realized that danger lay in letting matters rest merely with
                                rejecting the plan of that Bureau, a committee of the Foreign Office
                                began a study of the organization of their Department and after 2
                                months’ work brought forth the plan above-outlined.</p>
                            <p>We are informed by officials in the Foreign Office that this plan is
                                a compromise. The senior officers in the department—the Vice
                                Minister, Mr. Horinouchi, and the bureau directors—apparently favor
                                the making of modifications in organization with a view to the
                                elimination of friction with other departments on matters relating
                                to China, but without structurally changing the department. The
                                section chiefs and the younger men, however, are agitating for
                                drastic changes—for the centralization of power in matters relating
                                to China, now distributed among the Finance, Overseas Affairs, and
                                Commerce and Industry Ministries, along with the Foreign Office.</p>
                            <p>We understand that the latter group first proposed the setting up of
                                a Board of East Asian Affairs, to embrace the Manchuria Bureau of
                                the Ministry of Overseas Affairs, and the East Asia Bureau and the
                                Intelligence Section of the Foreign Office. This was to be an agency
                                independent of the Foreign Office, but to be under the direction of
                                the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The group of senior men criticized
                                the plan as unworkable, in which position the Minister agreed, but
                                it appears also that Mr. Hirota did not think too well of the
                                counterplan of the senior group, which is, in short, an enlargement
                                of the present East Asia Bureau and the Press Section and their
                                assimilation into a Political Affairs Bureau of which the director
                                would be the <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0174"/>Vice Minister.
                                The plan adopted by the Foreign Office committee obviously contains
                                certain features of both plans.</p>
                            <p>Whether the plan of reorganization has been formally adopted by the
                                Foreign Minister and will be presented to the Prime Minister is not
                                yet known. The important fact is that publication of the plan was
                                followed by a chorus of derision from those quarters whose views on
                                public matters now carry weight. The substance of their observations
                                was that the entire nation had made sacrifice of “blood and
                                treasure” to implement Japanese policy on the Continent, and that
                                the time had come when the exploitation of the fruits of their
                                sacrifices was a matter in which all elements of the community must
                                share, and not be left as a special prerogative of the professional
                                diplomatists or any other special group. The Prime Minister has
                                promised to look into the entire question of the administration of
                                Japanese interests in China, and one can expect to see in due course
                                some interesting developments which will leave some substantial mark
                                on the Foreign Office.</p>
                            <p>There has been taking place for some years a gradual change in the
                                type of men comprising the more successful group of the Japanese
                                Foreign Service. Such men as Baron Hayashi, Viscount Ishii, and Mr.
                                Matsudaira, who typify the Japanese diplomatist of an epoch now
                                past, are, by their personality, character and enlightened ideals,
                                qualified to take a high place in any society. The standard which
                                formerly prevailed is being gradually and steadily lowered by
                                process of dilution, the men entering the service for the past 15
                                years being progressively more parochial in their outlook and
                                nationalistic in their attitude. When the process of making the
                                Foreign Office an instrument of reactionary forces will have been
                                completed, one will be able to make the comment that it will then be
                                more truly reflective of national aspirations than it has been in
                                recent years.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: As of possible interest in so far as
                                it may shed further light upon the somewhat vague and ill-defined
                                recent Japanese policy known as the “Southward Advance”, I have the
                                honor to transmit herewith a translation<note n="41"
                                    xml:id="d165fn41">Not printed.</note> of an interpellation on
                                this subject in the Lower House of the Diet during the hearings on
                                March 16, 1938, on the Navy <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0175"
                                />Budget, and of the Navy Minister’s reply thereto. A translation of
                                the hearings in full on the Navy Budget were transmitted by the
                                Naval Attaché<note n="42" xml:id="d165fn42">Capt. Harold M.
                                    Bemis.</note> to the Navy Department in his confidential report

                                    found in Department files.</note></p>
                            <p>Although this Southward Advance policy was developed, probably at the
                                instigation of the navy, some two years ago, references to it have
                                been relatively infrequent and not of such a nature as to clarify
                                it; and although the present question and reply leave much to be
                                desired in respect of precision and clarity, nevertheless they do
                                reveal that the present intention of the naval authorities is that
                                such a policy should be pursued by means of peaceful economic
                                penetration rather than by force. In bringing up the subject the
                                interpellator opened by stating that the present “Continental
                                Policy”, (by which it may be presumed he refers to the policy of
                                expansion on the Asiatic mainland), is by itself insufficient to
                                meet the needs of Japan’s growing population which increases by one
                                million per annum. He points out, significantly, that the various
                                agrarian reform laws which have been and are constantly being tried
                                have proven to be powerless to remedy the situation and that,
                                therefore, thought must be given toward the question of “Southward
                                Advance.” It is stated that “Manchukuo” has failed to prove an
                                outlet for the surplus population as not more than 200,000 Japanese
                                have been induced to emigrate there since 1931, but that the South
                                Pacific offers room.</p>
                            <p>The interpellator is not specific as to the areas he has in mind
                                although he makes reference to the desirability of obtaining the
                                “understanding” of the United States for a peaceful exploitation of
                                islands “in the vicinity” of the Japanese Mandated Islands and he
                                remarks that Japan’s policy of expansion in this area need never
                                menace the United States. There are also mentioned as possibilities
                                for Japanese peaceful exploitation the Malay Peninsula and North
                                Africa and there is an oblique reference to the fact that Holland is
                                holding colonies in area eighty times as large as the motherland.
                                The interpellator closes by saying that industrialization alone will
                                not save the situation because the markets of the world are closed
                                to Japan’s surplus goods by tariff barriers; that there are many
                                peaceful means of pursuing the “Southward Advance”; and that it is
                                foolish to antagonize the United States and Great Britain and be
                                drawn into a naval race in spite of Japan’s policy of non-menace and
                                non-aggression.</p>
                            <p>The Navy Minister replied briefly, refusing to comment upon the
                                Continental Policy but agreeing that the “Southward Advance” was
                                worth thinking about. He emphasized, however, that this policy <pb
                                    n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0176"/>should be pursued by
                                peaceful and economic means only and he regards the Japanese
                                Mandated Islands as furnishing the first step in this direction. “It
                                would be better for people to go there first”, he says, “and thence
                                to the south or southwestward.”</p>
                            <p>This last phrase falls somewhat short of furnishing a definite
                                description of Japan’s objectives and embraces a substantial amount
                                of territory.</p>

                            <p>322. 1. The Japanese Government is discouraging through the press and
                                radio any disposition on the part of the public to assume that the
                                capture of Hsuchow will directly lead to the collapse of Chinese
                                military resistance. Such indication of the Government’s views has
                                had a sobering effect, and there is general realization that the end
                                is still far off.</p>
                            <p>2. Among informed Japanese, both official and private, emphasis is
                                being placed on the fact that since classic times Hsuchow, by reason
                                of its strategic position, has been the goal of those who sought to
                                conquer China, and that its occupation by Japanese forces will have
                                profound immediate effects, both strategic and psychological, on the
                                Chinese. They admit, however, that the secondary effects are as
                                likely to be the passing of control from Chiang Kai Shek to the
                                Communist element, with intensified Chinese resistance and increased
                                possibility of Soviet involvement, as the development of Chinese
                                internal dissension.</p>
                            <p>3. Belief that the drive on Hankow will occur (see my 282, April 28,
                                7 p.m.) is becoming more pronounced.</p>
                            <p>Repeated to Shanghai for Hankow.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Hornbeck</hi>: I must thank you for your
                                letter and enclosure of April 13th, and for the care with which you
                                and your colleagues have considered and replied to the points
                                contained in our statement. <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0177"
                                />As you say, the two documents were written from different
                                standpoints, which accounts largely for such differences of opinion
                                as they contain.</p>
                            <p>Ours contemplated the protection of our interests in the Far East and
                                the restoration of peace by some form of armed intervention, while
                                you have considered the problem in an attitude of greater
                                detachment. I can only hope your expectations may be justified and
                                that Japan will in course of time be brought to see the error of her
                                ways by reason only of the moral indignation of other nations and
                                her own economic difficulties.</p>
                            <p>I note with interest the statement that certain of your officers are
                                examining the possibility of commercial reprisals in connection with
                                the disregard of your interests and representations by the parties
                                to the present hostilities. Hitherto our consideration of this
                                question has been with a view to cooperation with other Powers in
                                applying economic sanctions against Japan with the object of forcing
                                her to cease hostilities. Like you, however, we are now turning our
                                attention to the possibility of economic retaliation against the
                                many insults and injuries to which our nationals and interests are
                                being subjected and for which we have failed so far to obtain any
                                reasonable satisfaction.</p>
                            <p>As soon as we have come to any definite conclusions on the subject we
                                shall be glad to inform you of them. Needless to say, we should be
                                extremely interested to learn on what lines you have been working
                                and what conclusions seem to be indicated by your enquiry so far;
                                and we shall be happy to exchange information on Japan’s economic
                                position if that would be considered helpful.</p>
                            <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to submit the
                                following, which is intended somewhat briefly to review events in
                                China since the beginning of 1937.</p>
                            <p>The year opened with a domestic political situation upset by the
                                kidnapping of Chiang Kai-shek during the closing days of 1936. There
                                was a definite impression that the Generalissimo’s release from his
                                captors, who comprised a group made up of Chinese communists,
                                officers of the northeastern army under Chang Hsueh-liang, and
                                officers of the Shensi provincial forces under Yang Hu-cheng, had
                                been effected as the result of an understanding between the
                                Generalissimo and those forces calling for a more active policy of
                                opposition to Japanese encroachments on China.</p>
                            <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0178"/>
                            <p>Up to this time China’s policy vis-à-vis Japan had been one of
                                conciliation tempered by passive resistance. The Generalissimo and
                                those who immediately surrounded him, feverishly working on plans of
                                national reconstruction and dominated by business interests in
                                Shanghai, feared a policy of active opposition to the Japanese lest
                                it bring war, for which they felt the country was unprepared and
                                which would bring reconstruction plans to a halt. The Government was
                                in no position to make a formal settlement of outstanding issues
                                with Japan, however, because it was too weak to accept a settlement
                                along the very onerous lines laid down by the Japanese
                                Government—amounting almost to complete capitulation—and to lead the
                                rest of the country into accepting such a settlement. Its policy was
                                one of weakness and depended for its success upon domestic
                                developments in Japan: there was always the hope that in Japan the
                                advocates of a strong policy in China would lose, in the conflict
                                which it was known was going on between them and those who advocated
                                a more liberal China policy.</p>
                            <p>Since Japanese occupation of Manchuria in 1931 and the advance of the
                                Japanese southward into eastern Hopei, there had arisen among the
                                Chinese a longing for a cessation of the domestic strife which had
                                racked the country since the Revolution of 1911. People high and low
                                realized that domestic disunity made China an easy prey for the kind
                                of aggression which Japan seemed prepared to wage. The kidnapping of
                                the Generalissimo at Sian in December, 1936, did more than anything
                                else to crystallize public attention upon this main weakness in
                                China’s domestic politics, and centered all eyes upon the
                                Generalissimo as a symbol of Chinese unity,—as opposed to Chang
                                Hsuehliang, the Young Marshal, who became overnight the symbol of
                                that disunity which the people hated and were ashamed of. It was not
                                so much the popularity which the Generalissimo as an individual may
                                have enjoyed that brought the country as a whole suddenly to his
                                support, but the feeling that the forces in favor of unity had won a
                                victory. The people began to feel that the Generalissimo and those
                                who stood with him at the head of Government had done more for
                                Chinese unity in the past ten years than any other group which had
                                come forward to leadership.</p>
                            <p>But this victory for unity had not been achieved without a price. The
                                price paid was the terms which apparently were made at Sian before
                                the Generalissimo was freed. It was believed then—and I know no
                                reason to change that opinion now—that, as the result of conferences
                                which the Generalissimo had with communist leaders at Sian, he
                                agreed that there would be no further active hostilities against the
                                communists, who would be allowed to remain in peace where they then
                                were in northern China; that the communist forces <pb n="175"
                                    xml:id="pg_175" facs="0179"/>would be given financial assistance
                                by the Central Government; and that by gradual stages officials
                                sympathetic to the communists would be introduced into the Central
                                Government. More important and more fateful for the Government’s
                                course of action, though, was the understanding that the
                                Government’s policy vis-à-vis Japan would stiffen. A stiffening of
                                the Government’s policy vis-à-vis Japan was acceptable not only to
                                the communist groups concentrated in northern Shensi, but also to
                                the Kwangsi group led by Li Tsung-jen and Pai Chung-hsi. Put in
                                another way, the settlement at Sian was understood to mean a shift
                                in policy away from conciliation of Japan to conciliation of Russia,
                                although there is no evidence to indicate that Soviet Russia at that
                                time had anything to do with the settlement. The shift was due to
                                fear of Japan rather than love of Russia.</p>
                            <p>The Chinese people and their leaders were not interested then, nor
                                are they interested now, in seeking the alliance of any foreign
                                country. There are plenty of Chinese, prominent political leaders
                                among them, whose training was received in Japan and whose tendency
                                was in the direction of closer and friendly relations with the
                                Japanese, a people whose culture and civilization they understood
                                and were in sympathy with. But they feared Japan. They feared the
                                loss of independence which closer relations with Japan threaten, not
                                only because of Japan’s actions in Manchuria and North China, but
                                because such advances as Japan had made indicated a Japanese
                                ambition completely to dominate China politically and economically.
                                To this the Chinese were opposed, and if compromise with the
                                so-called communist group in China meant a drift in the direction of
                                Russia, the Chinese preferred that course with its uncertainties to
                                what they considered to be a certain future with the Japanese. Thus
                                it was that the Sian incident which occurred at the end of 1936 left
                                the Chinese Government and its leadership definitely pledged to a
                                policy of resistance by force to further Japanese encroachment.</p>
                            <p>[Here follows review of foreign and domestic developments since early
                                1937.]</p>
                            <p>In so far as this Embassy has been able to observe, responsible
                                leaders of the Chinese National Government had, by July, 1937,
                                reached the determination that, at the next indication of Japanese
                                encroachment upon China, China would have to throw its entire
                                strength into resistance. They were forced to this decision by two
                                considerations: (1) a review of Sino-Japanese relations during the
                                past thirty odd years revealed a never-ending series of Japanese
                                encroachments upon China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,
                                which the Chinese leaders believed must lead ultimately to the
                                subjecting of China to a domination by Japan not unlike that which
                                Great Britain exercises in India; and (2) the commitments which the
                                National <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0180"/>Government had
                                been forced to make to the communists and other dissatisfied groups
                                as a result of the Sian incident. These commitments, although they
                                were wrested from the Central Government by a small group of
                                dissatisfied leaders, carried the popular support of the nation; and
                                political and intellectual leaders who have guided the destinies of
                                the Chinese people on the road toward national, political, economic
                                and intellectual unity during recent years realized that they could
                                not survive if they permitted the continuation of the gradual
                                process of Japanese aggression without resistance.</p>
                            <p>From this determination it logically followed that, with the outbreak
                                of hostilities in North China between the Japanese forces and the
                                troops of General Sung Che-yuan—who were reported as being none too
                                determined and not to be counted upon, but who at the same time
                                stood between the popularly-termed Central Government forces and the
                                Japanese—the Chinese should, if possible, do what they could to
                                shape the course of events so as to extend as much as possible the
                                Japanese lines and at the same time make it possible for China’s
                                best troops to grapple with the Japanese forces at a point most
                                advantageous to the Chinese. Therefore, the Chinese were prepared,
                                willing and anxious to see the hostilities extended even to the
                                Shanghai area where foreign interests were concentrated and where
                                China’s cause might be expected to receive the widest publicity in
                                the West. The Chinese were naturally not unmindful of the effect
                                this would have upon Western interests which would be affected.</p>
                            <p>Whatever the situation might have been before hostilities began as
                                regards the ability of Chinese leadership to Unite the common people
                                of the country in a war of armed resistance to Japanese invasion,
                                the methods used by the Japanese military forces since the beginning
                                of hostilities certainly have resulted in bringing home to the
                                common people of China the realities of what the hostilities mean.
                                The result is that a spirit of resistance has steadily spread
                                throughout the country, uniting the people to their political,
                                military and intellectual leaders as they have never been united
                                before. The country people, in a resistance born of despair, are
                                arming themselves everywhere. It becomes increasingly doubtful
                                whether Japan can by mere force of arms conquer the country except
                                by completely ruining it. From Suiyuan in the North to Hangchow in
                                the South, armed bands of Chinese peasants are attacking Japanese
                                wherever they find them. It is, I think, a fair assumption that when
                                hostilities commenced the Japanese military leaders expected that
                                with the capture of Nanking they would be able to obtain from a
                                defeated Chinese Government a dictated peace which would be along
                                the lines of Hirota’s three points. The Japanese Army lost the war
                                when they took Nanking and failed <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177"
                                    facs="0181"/>to obtain such a peace, and when they allowed their
                                soldiers to wage pitiless war upon the civilian population of the
                                country between Shanghai and Nanking, and in the city of
                                Nanking.</p>
                            <p>This result left the Japanese to face two alternatives: they could
                                either consolidate their positions already achieved and bide their
                                time, or proceed to the conquest of China. It would appear that
                                Japan chose the latter alternative. Indeed, it would have been
                                difficult for them to do otherwise, for an armed China would have
                                remained as a constant threat to the position which they had
                                achieved. An Imperial Conference was held in Tokyo, and it was
                                solemnly announced that the Japanese Government would no longer
                                recognize the Government headed by Chiang Kai-shek. The Japanese
                                Ambassador was called home, and the Chinese Ambassador to Japan was
                                withdrawn.</p>

                                    Japan</hi></p>
                            <p>Throughout all of these difficulties between China and Japan there
                                has existed in China a peace party interested in reaching some
                                peaceful settlement with Japan. The idea of Sino-Japanese
                                cooperation, economic or otherwise, has a certain appeal to Chinese.
                                There is a large group of Chinese who were trained in Japan and who
                                have friends there. This is especially true in army circles. General
                                Chiang Kai-shek who got his early education in Japan has always been
                                considered as one of those; while Chang Chun, who was Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs for a time and who had been a fellow student with
                                the Generalissimo in Japan, was also considered as one of those who
                                were inclined to be conciliatory toward Japan. Wang Ching-wei was
                                another, and, as political heir to Sun Yat-sen, he wielded an
                                influence in politics which should have been available to the
                                Japanese. Dr. H. H. Kung and the War Minister General Ho Ying-chin
                                were also numbered among this group. All of these were men of
                                influence in the Government, and it is believed that if the Japanese
                                had chosen to play their cards differently it should have been
                                possible to have utilized the cooperation of these men to a better
                                advantage.</p>
                            <p>Chiang Kai-shek has at all times been deeply conscious of the
                                weakness and lack of unity in China. His public utterances at all
                                times indicated a desire to meet the Japanese half way; the
                                sincerity of these public utterances was borne out by statements
                                which he made in private. But the conditions under which the
                                Japanese publicly and privately announced their readiness to
                                cooperate with the Chinese were such that none of these Chinese
                                leaders, no matter how influential they might have been in Chinese
                                circles, could have accepted them or hoped to induce their own
                                people to accept them.</p>

                                Japanese expected a Japanese Inspector General of Customs with
                                Japanese appointees to dominate the Customs at the several ports; a
                                Sino-Japanese military alliance directed against Russia; Japanese

                                live at peace with both Russia and Japan, their nearest neighbors.
                                Sino-Japanese cooperation was believed to include an economic bloc,
                                consisting of Japan, “Manchukuo” and the Chinese republic; and a
                                revision of the tariff to permit exchange of products of Japanese
                                industry against Chinese raw materials,—a tariff which in Chinese
                                eyes would have resulted in the complete destruction of nascent
                                Chinese industry which was beginning to parallel Japanese industry.
                                By suppression of anti-Japanese activities the Chinese understood
                                the Japanese to mean the complete revision of Chinese text books of
                                history and the use of Japanese teachers in the schools, with the
                                adoption of an educational policy that would look to a complete
                                denationalization of the Chinese. Thus interpreted—and there was no
                                reason for a different interpretation—no Chinese leader could hope
                                to work out any scheme of cooperation with Japan for which they
                                could win the support of the people of the country.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese Government apparently expected to dictate peace along
                                these lines with the fall of Nanking. There is no reason why they
                                should have been surprised at their failure, for it has been clear
                                enough to those who have continued among the Chinese that such a
                                peace would be impossible as long as the Chinese Government and its
                                people could resist.</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Communism</hi></p>
                            <p>There has been a good deal said about the existence of communism in
                                China. There has been much said about the Chinese drift in the
                                direction of Soviet Russia. Chinese leadership was no more
                                interested in entering into an alliance with Soviet Russia, with all
                                that that might imply, than it was interested in entering into an
                                alliance with Japan. Soviet Russia and Japan are China’s nearest
                                neighbors. Soviet Russia has been instrumental in depriving China of
                                Outer Mongolia, and is at the present time strongly entrenched in
                                Sinkiang. Chinese leadership had its fill of Soviet interference in
                                Chinese politics in 1926, and does not wish to repeat that
                                experience. China has fought communism on its own soil for ten
                                years.</p>
                            <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0183"/>
                            <p>Chinese communism was a communism which grew out of agrarian
                                discontent. It was essentially an agrarian movement, and in no sense
                                an industrial proletarian movement such as that which took over the
                                cities and established communism in Russia. This agrarian movement
                                in China used the slogans and the catch phrases, and some of the
                                philosophy of Marxian socialism borrowed from Soviet Russian
                                advisers, but it never achieved any position of importance in
                                Government or in the industrial centers. There existed plenty of
                                domestic reason for a spirit of revolt in the rural communities in
                                the provinces of Kiangsi, Hunan, Honan and Hupeh, where there was
                                much discontent among the predominant tenant farmer class and where
                                agriculture was bankrupt.</p>
                            <p>In 1923 and 1924, when Sun Yat-sen was organizing the Kuomintang with
                                Russian assistance along the totalitarian lines of the communist
                                party in Russia, he permitted Chinese communists to become members
                                of the Kuomintang. These were days of active intervention in Chinese
                                domestic affairs by agents of Soviet Russia who were being used as
                                advisers. But a break came in 1927 between the communist and the
                                nationalist elements in the Kuomintang. Perhaps, to use a popular
                                conception, one might refer to it as a break between the communist
                                and fascist elements in the Kuomintang.</p>
                            <p>After the break and the departure of the Russian advisers, the
                                communist element in China took to the mountains of Kiangsi and
                                there began a conflict which ended only in the winter of 1936, when
                                the remnants of the determined bands of rural revolutionaries, still
                                burning with the fires of Marxian socialism, were finally permitted
                                by the Government to settle down in peace in the arid and
                                inhospitable regions of northern Shensi. Their leaders who had
                                brought them through the difficulties of the ten years’ war were
                                still with them. Recent visitors to that area tell of meeting men
                                who joined the movement as children and have followed it through all
                                its long struggle, and who still burn with enthusiasm for the cause.
                                It is the only element in China indicating that the Revolution of
                                1911 has touched and moved the peasant population.</p>
                            <p>By January, 1937, Soviet Russia was solidly installed in Sinkiang,
                                with advisers employed in the Government at Urumchi. That some
                                intercourse was possible between Soviet Russia and the Chinese
                                communists in northern Shensi there can be no doubt; but that this
                                intercourse went far is doubtful. By January, 1937, Soviet Russia
                                was in the midst of a domestic political purge which indicated the
                                existence of a domestic struggle, with a drift toward nationalism
                                and isolationism.</p>
                            <p>By August, 1937, an arrangement had been entered into between the
                                Central Government and Chinese communist leaders which brought <pb
                                    n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0184"/>the communists into Shansi
                                and allied them definitely with the Central Government in the
                                struggle of resistance against Japanese invasion. The function of
                                these communist forces has been to pursue against Japanese invaders
                                the same guerrilla tactics which they had used so successfully in
                                resisting Chinese Government forces during ten years of warfare, and
                                to train the country people of Shansi and Hopei for guerrilla
                                warfare behind the Japanese lines. There is reason to believe that
                                the Kwangsi leader, Pai Chung-hsi, participated in bringing about
                                this arrangement.</p>
                            <p>It is true that the Soviet Ambassador signed with the Chinese
                                Government, after the beginning of the Sino-Japanese conflict, a
                                non-aggression treaty. It is true also that the Chinese have been
                                able to obtain military equipment from Soviet Russia, and Soviet
                                Russian volunteer aviators, but it is believed that all of this
                                equipment and service is being paid for. The former Soviet
                                Ambassador complained to me of the difficulty which he had had in
                                persuading the Chinese to sign a non-aggression pact, and further,
                                of his failure to negotiate a commercial treaty. The Soviet
                                Ambassador was recalled to Russia with his Military Attaché at the
                                end of September, and was replaced by a new Ambassador who is only
                                thirty-eight years of age, whose entire adult life has been spent in
                                Russia or in Turkestan, and who evidently definitely belongs to the
                                group of young Russians whose experience has been Russia, who are
                                followers and supporters of Stalin and the group of Bolshevist
                                leaders whose services as revolutionaries were rendered entirely
                                within the Government and who never lived abroad as exiles.</p>
                            <p>The path of Soviet Russia has been a wary one. The Chinese have
                                leaned over backwards trying to avoid an arrangement which might
                                lend color to Japanese accusations of an alliance. One may say the
                                same of the conduct of Soviet Russia throughout these
                                hostilities,—although it is apparent that Soviet Russia has been
                                guided in its relations with China by a hope that the Chinese would
                                continue resistance to Japan to the point where Japan would be
                                exhausted, believing that a Japan exhausted and occupied in China
                                would not be a menace to Soviet Russia.</p>
                            <p>As this is being written, ten months after the first shot was fired
                                at Lukouchiao, the Japanese, at an enormous expenditure of blood and
                                treasure, are battling determined Chinese troops for the possession
                                of Hsuchow. Japan has withdrawn recognition from Nationalist China,
                                although diplomatic relations have not been broken off and no war
                                has been declared. It is expected shortly that Japan will extend <hi
                                    rend="italic">de jure</hi> recognition to the puppet régime
                                which is being established in Peiping and Nanking under the
                                protection of Japanese military force. This régime is helpless
                                except in areas immediately occupied by Japanese <pb n="181"
                                    xml:id="pg_181" facs="0185"/>troops who hold a number of cities
                                and patrol constantly the connecting lines of communication. All of
                                the interior area is controlled by Chinese forces who carry on
                                guerrilla tactics against the Japanese and the forces of the
                                Japanese-fostered régime. This chaos will spread, the farther
                                Japanese forces penetrate into the country. Japan will make a treaty
                                along the lines of Hirota’s three points with the régime which it
                                has fostered at such expense. Japanese advisers will be appointed to
                                aid in the processes of government,—civil, judicial and military. A
                                tariff bloc will be established with tariffs favoring Japanese
                                goods. Extraterritoriality will be abolished as was done in
                                Manchuria. But the time is yet distant when Japan will have
                                succeeded in establishing peace throughout China. The struggle will
                                go bitterly and stubbornly on, and it is doubtful whether Japan,
                                single-handed, can muster enough men or money to complete the task.
                                The East is apparently doomed to a period of warfare and turmoil
                                which will last for years.</p>

                                <item>The Chinese Ambassador called at the Department on May 19 and
                                    stated that the Chinese Government had knowledge of an intention
                                    on the part of the Japanese Government to replace the members of
                                    the judiciary in Shanghai with new appointees to be appointed by
                                    the Japanese sponsored authorities at Nanking. The Ambassador
                                    expressed the very earnest hope that the Department would
                                    instruct its Consular representative at Shanghai to refuse to
                                    recognize any new judges who might be appointed by Japan. The
                                    Chinese Ambassador was informed that the question raised by him

                                    printed.</note> The German Ambassador has returned to Hankow and
                                yesterday gave to the press a statement to the effect that the
                                German Government had expressed a desire to the Chinese Government
                                that the advisers should be allowed to cancel their contracts with
                                the Chinese Government and return to Germany. German Ambassador is
                                credited with having stated that this request was motivated by the
                                consideration of neutrality. I have not asked German Ambassador for
                                any explanation, but I believe move at this late date is result of
                                pressure from Japan.</p>
                            <p>What action advisers will take remains to be seen. It is reported
                                that General Von Falkenhausen, chief adviser, may seek to remain as
                                guest of Generalissimo. I understand that German Ambassador opposed
                                recall. Departure of advisers will have a depressing effect upon
                                Chinese whom they have served well and loyally. I understand that
                                Germany has also put a stop to sale of munitions. This may have
                                greater effect than departure of advisers as I understand Japanese
                                forces are evidently now making a determined effort to obtain
                                control of Lunghai Railway and appear to be having considerable
                                success. Chinese forces in retreat will break up into small
                                guerrilla bands. Loss of Hankow seems only a question of time.
                                Perhaps these developments involving failure of Chinese armies have
                                helped to bring German Government to this action.</p>

                            <p>323. 1. The Counselor of the local German Embassy who hag many years
                                of service in China has just returned from 4 weeks in Chahar <pb

                                traveled as far as Outer Mongolia border. He has given the Embassy
                                the information contained in the next paragraph.</p>
                            <p>2. The Japanese military hold no places off the Peiping–Suiyuan
                                Railway. The Chinese and Mongol population along the railway is
                                bitterly anti-Japanese. Chinese irregulars approach close to cities
                                along the railway and frequently cause traffic to be suspended. They
                                occupy such points as Changpei 25 miles north of Kalgan and Anpei
                                northwest Paotou. The Japanese have given up all pretense of
                                developing a puppet Mongol régime and direction of affairs along the
                                railway is for the time being in the hands of Japanese military.
                                Prince Teh no longer has significance. The Japanese are obtaining
                                little raw material because Chinese and Mongols, having received
                                inadequate compensation, now do not bring their produce to
                                market.</p>
                            <p>3. Informant stated that the number of Japanese troops along the
                                railway is small. However, reports current in Peiping indicate that
                                some reenforcements have been sent to the area during the past few
                                days, presumably some of those troops mentioned in the Embassy’s

                                the German military mission from China and the stoppage of the

                                        <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0188"/>the Chairman and

                                    question of the status of the First Special District Court was
                                    discussed as a preliminary to possible consideration later at a
                                    full meeting of the consular body, which body has not yet
                                    considered the question. Prior to meeting it had been rumored
                                    that the Japanese might attempt to seize the court on May 16 but
                                    no such attempt was made. As a precautionary measure, however,
                                    added police protection had been thrown around the court
                                    building on that day, augmented by a guard from the Seaforth
                                    Highlanders and a small detail from the Fourth Marines which
                                    afforded additional protection to one of the court buildings in
                                    the American sector. These measures were taken as a precaution
                                    against any possible attempt to use force to acquire possession
                                    of the court or against possible kidnapping or other incident.
                                    The day passed quietly and there was no threat of intrusion. It
                                    is possible that the above mentioned rumor may have been based
                                    on the fact that a small group Japanese judges, who were
                                    visiting in Shanghai at the time, desired to visit the court.
                                    This visit was made without incident or undue commotion.</item>

                                    and that the caller was being received in the same capacity.
                                    Lynn, who is an American returned student, is the person
                                    referred to in paragraph 2 of my 655, May 13, 4 p.m. Apparently
                                    his reputation is not good and there is reason to believe that
                                    he is an active participant in the effort to impair the position
                                    of the First Special District Court. He informed the British
                                    Consul General that he had been selected because of his
                                    knowledge both of Japanese and foreign “ideas” and that he had
                                    accepted the appointment because some one else might have been
                                    appointed who might not have been so reasonable in the matter of
                                    taking over the court. He asked for sympathetic consideration
                                    and cooperation and stated that he intended to make no changes
                                    in the staff; and [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] if they were
                                    willing to remain and cooperate with him, and that, if they did
                                    not cooperate, he had a staff he could install. The British
                                    Consul General pointed out that the Special Court was not an
                                    ordinary Chinese court but a special organ devised as a result
                                    of an experience of many years to meet the peculiar needs of
                                    Shanghai and that it was inadvisable that any change should be
                                    made at this time inasmuch as the court was working
                                    satisfactorily. Lynn was asked what laws <pb n="185"
                                        xml:id="pg_185" facs="0189"/>it was proposed to enforce and
                                    he stated it would be the existing laws of the Chinese
                                    Government. He also stated that it was necessary for the Reform
                                    Government to have control of the courts just as it did of all
                                    other functions of the Government in this area. At the close of
                                    the interview Lynn stated that all rumors that the courts would
                                    be taken over by force were without foundation.</item>

                                    Consul General on May 18. Lynn has made no effort to see me on
                                    the subject. If he does approach me I shall receive him only in
                                    my private capacity and will let him know that he is being
                                    received in the same manner.</item>

                                <item>I believe that the views set forth on page 7 of Shanghai
                                    despatch No. 1283, March 16, 1938,<note n="51" xml:id="d173fn51"
                                        >Not printed.</note> are substantially correct and that the
                                    despatch in its entirety presents a clear picture of the court
                                    situation as it exists now, with the exception that a president
                                    of the court has since been appointed by the Reform Government
                                    and that we are now much nearer to a crisis in the court
                                    question, as the movement to take over the court has gained some
                                    momentum since the appointment of Lynn. I personally doubt if
                                    any attempt will be made to take over the court by force, but
                                    other means, among which may be found intimidation and political
                                    chicanery, to accomplish this end will probably be
                                    employed.</item>

                                has been a perceptible stiffening of the attitude of the British
                                authorities in Shanghai vis-à-vis the Japanese during the past month
                                in connection with various incidents which have arisen involving
                                Japanese military or naval units and British subjects or
                                interests.</p>

                            <p>On April 26, the British merchant vessel S. S. <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Tungwo</hi> was boarded by the Japanese military and compelled
                                to proceed to Tsungming Island, at the mouth of the Yangtze River.
                                The vessel was held there for twenty-four hours, notwithstanding
                                immediate and repeated protests made by the British consular
                                authorities. The vessel was finally released following very strong
                                representations to the Japanese authorities and the dispatch of H.
                                M. S. <hi rend="italic">Cricket</hi> to Tsungming Island with orders
                                to stand by until the S. S. <hi rend="italic">Tungwo</hi> was
                                released.</p>
                            <p>On May 2, the British merchant vessel S. S. <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Kingyuan</hi> was stopped while proceeding down river from
                                Shanghai and boarded by a party of Japanese gendarmes who detained
                                the vessel for two hours and thoroughly searched her before
                                permitting her to proceed. The local British authorities are
                                understood to have made strong representations concerning this
                                further instance of the unauthorized boarding and search of a
                                British merchant vessel and to have pointed out that such action was
                                in complete disregard of British rights and the “Gentlemen’s
                                Agreement” reached between the British and Japanese Governments at
                                the commencement of the Japanese blockade whereby it was agreed that
                                Japanese naval vessels should be permitted to ascertain the right of
                                a vessel to fly the British flag provided that no British naval
                                vessel was in the vicinity at the time.</p>
                            <p>On May 13, Mr. E. S. Wilkinson, a well known British resident and
                                local naturalist who was out walking in the early morning in the
                                Hungjao district and observing bird life, was not only arrested by
                                Japanese soldiers but was also assaulted and stabbed in the back. He
                                was held for twelve hours by the Japanese military authorities and
                                all attempts to see him and effect his release, including an attempt
                                made in person by General Telfer Smollett, Commandant of the British
                                Defense Forces, were ineffectual. British consular and diplomatic
                                authorities made repeated representations throughout the day and
                                eventually brought about his release. The local British authorities,
                                including the British Ambassador who had just returned to Shanghai,
                                took a serious view of this incident in which a British subject was
                                without apparent reason or provocation set upon and stabbed by
                                Japanese soldiers and held incommunicado for twelve hours. A strong
                                formal protest was lodged with the Japanese authorities here by the
                                British Consul General and the British Ambassador is understood to
                                have made use of strong and forthright language in writing
                                informally to Mr. Tani, the senior Japanese diplomatic officer in
                                China. Strong representations were understood to have been made also
                                in Tokyo by the British Ambassador. The British are understood to
                                have demanded a formal apology, compensation for the injuries
                                sustained by Mr. Wilkinson arid specific information regarding the
                                disciplinary action taken against the soldiers responsible for the
                                assault.</p>
                            <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0191"/>
                            <p>In discussing these cases with the British consular authorities in
                                Shanghai the definite impression has been gained that both the oral
                                and written representations concerning these incidents have been
                                couched in much stronger language than has been the case heretofore
                                and that in general the attitude of the British authorities has
                                stiffened.</p>
                            <p>Another instance of the stronger policy apparently being followed by
                                the British authorities in local affairs is to be found in the
                                action of the British military authorities in suddenly commencing to
                                patrol Nanking Road and the Louza district of the central area. The
                                first occasion on which British military patrols appeared was May 1
                                when a bomb exploded on Nanking Road just after a Japanese naval
                                truck had passed. About an hour later Japanese soldiers and
                                gendarmes commenced patrolling Nanking Road in considerable force.
                                British troops were thereupon also dispatched to the scene of the
                                incident and remained on patrol “to protect the Japanese patrols” it
                                was explained by British military headquarters, until the Japanese
                                troops and gendarmes had been withdrawn. Since then British troops
                                have regularly patrolled Nanking Road and the Louza district. In
                                this connection it is of interest to note that this sector was taken
                                over from the Shanghai Volunteer Corps by the British Defense Forces
                                following the demobilization of the former last year and that
                                theoretically the latter are responsible for the defense of this
                                area and to some extent responsible also for the maintenance of
                                peace and good order. However, heretofore the British have made no
                                effort to patrol this area and have in fact studiously avoided
                                assuming any responsibility for this area notwithstanding the fact
                                that a considerable number of incidents occurred therein in which
                                the Japanese military acted with little regard for the rights of the
                                International Settlement or the peace and security of its
                                residents.</p>
                            <p>It is felt, therefore, that the dispatch of British patrols into this
                                area since the first of May is of considerable significance and is a
                                further indication that the British authorities here propose to show
                                a firmer attitude in dealing with the Japanese authorities
                                concerning matters affecting British interests in the Shanghai area.
                                Some observers connect this firming of the British attitude with the

                                as of probable interest to the Department, copies of an exchange of
                                    correspondence<note n="53" xml:id="d175fn53">Not printed.</note>
                                between the Commanding Officer of the United States Fourth
                                    Marines<note n="54" xml:id="d175fn54">Col. Charles F. B.
                                    Price.</note> and the Japanese military and naval authorities
                                concerning the entry of armed Japanese units into the American
                                defense sector and the passage of Japanese military and naval trucks
                                through that sector.</p>
                            <p>It will be noted that definite understandings were reached both with
                                the Japanese naval and military authorities on these matters. The
                                agreement with the Headquarters of the Japanese Naval Landing Party
                                is set forth in the memorandum dated March 17 attached to Admiral
                                Yarnell’s letter to Mr. Gauss dated March 18. It indicates clearly
                                that when the American naval authorities decided to permit the
                                billeting of a small number of naval units in Japanese mills located
                                within the American sector, it was agreed by the Headquarters of the
                                Japanese Naval Landing Party that no patrols should operate outside
                                of these mills and that Japanese liaison and ration trucks were to
                                move to and from these mills to Chapei only via the Ichang Road
                                Bridge over Soochow Creek. By reference to the memorandum mentioned
                                it will be noted that this understanding was not scrupulously
                                observed, inasmuch as on several occasions armed Japanese naval
                                units in considerable numbers passed through the American sector
                                without previous notification and other than by the route agreed
                                upon. However, the situation with respect to Japanese naval traffic
                                has greatly improved.</p>
                            <p>The American Marine authorities experienced greater difficulties with
                                the Japanese military. Japanese military traffic through the
                                American sector became so heavy that Colonel Price protested
                                repeatedly to Japanese Military Headquarters and eventually an
                                understanding was reached regarding these matters and is set forth
                                in Colonel Price’s letters of March 22 and 24. The agreement of the
                                Japanese Military Headquarters to Colonel Price’s stipulations
                                regarding the passage of Japanese army traffic through the American
                                defense sector appears in Colonel Takahashi’s letter of March 26. It
                                will be noted that this agreement specifies the type of Japanese
                                military vehicles permitted passage and refers to the arms which may
                                be carried by the personnel riding in such vehicles. With reference
                                    <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0193"/>to the number of supply
                                trucks permitted each day it will be seen by reference to the letter
                                from Japanese Military Headquarters dated March 26 and Colonel
                                Price’s letter of March 28, that the latter acceded to the request
                                of the Japanese military and agreed that a total of twenty supply
                                trucks, ten east bound and ten west bound, might daily pass through
                                the American sector. Both parties, it will be noted, reserved the
                                right to modify, amend or suspend this understanding.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese military authorities in agreeing to Colonel Price’s
                                stipulations had requested that American Marine sentries be removed
                                as a gesture of friendliness and goodwill. Colonel Price intimated,
                                however, that until the volume of traffic had been definitely
                                restricted he could not comply with the request. A gradual
                                improvement did take place between March 26 and April 2 and on the
                                latter date Marine sentries were removed. Almost immediately armed
                                and unarmed Japanese soldiers in considerable numbers appeared in
                                the American sector, while the volume of traffic increased to two
                                hundred and sixty trucks per day carrying all types of “supplies”
                                and running over routes not included in the original understanding.
                                Protests made by Colonel Price to Japanese Military Headquarters
                                brought about some improvement but from the subsequent
                                correspondence on these matters it will be seen that many violations
                                occurred. Such violations still continue although there has been
                                some improvement.</p>
                            <p>It is believed this correspondence is of interest inasmuch as it
                                upholds the principle that the armed forces of one country may not
                                move through the defense sector at Shanghai assigned to another
                                country without prior notice and agreement and indicates,
                                furthermore, that this principle is recognized by the Japanese
                                military and naval authorities. In this connection it may be noted
                                that the British military authorities were disinclined to cooperate
                                with the American defense forces in these matters and made no effort
                                to prevent Japanese military traffic through their sector. It is
                                believed that this <hi rend="italic">laissez faire</hi> policy was
                                followed because of the strained relations existing between the
                                British and Japanese here and because the British did not wish to
                                aggravate an already delicate situation.</p>
                            <p>The other point of interest brought out in this correspondence is the
                                fact that although a definite understanding was reached between the
                                American Marine authorities and the Headquarters of the Japanese
                                Expeditionary Forces at Shanghai regarding these matters, and
                                repeated written and oral assurances were received to the effect
                                that orders implementing this understanding had been issued and that
                                    <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0194"/>every effort was being
                                made to carry them out, violations varying in degree and number
                                continuously occurred. It can only be inferred either that the
                                responsible officers attached to Japanese Military Headquarters did
                                not sincerely attempt to carry out the terms of the understanding or
                                that the Japanese military are extraordinarily inefficient in the
                                matter of disseminating and executing orders.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                                me dated May 30, stating that his Government feels that if the
                                Japanese Government acts upon its rumored intention to make public
                                announcement of the occupation of certain Chinese islands it might
                                be difficult for the Japanese to relinquish control of these islands
                                on the conclusion of hostilities. Having been instructed to express
                                his views, after consultation with our French colleague and myself,
                                on the desirability of renewing representations to warn the Japanese
                                authorities against such a step before they commit themselves so far
                                that they cannot withdraw without loss of prestige, Craigie has
                                expressed to me the feeling that in view of Hirota’s attitude at
                                their meeting on February 9 (see our telegram under reference) any
                                further representations would have no useful results. Craigie is
                                furthermore of the opinion that public announcement of the
                                occupation of the Chinese islands would not, provided it does not
                                mention annexation, make their relinquishment more difficult than it
                                already is; and furthermore that if public announcement is made we
                                can seize the opportunity to reserve all our rights.</p>
                            <p>I have replied briefly stating that my feeling coincides with his but
                                that I have not consulted my Government and that this represents
                                only my personal attitude.</p>
                            <p>Copies of Craigie’s letter and of my reply go forward by pouch

                            <p>286. Department’s 77, May 26, 7 p.m.</p>
                            <p>1. The Chief of the Far Eastern Section of the Foreign Office in the
                                course of a conversation stated that the German Ambassador at
                                    Hankow<note n="57" xml:id="d177fn57">Oskar Trautmann.</note> had
                                informed the various German ex-army officers who have been acting as
                                military advisers to the Chinese Government that it was “out of line
                                with Germany’s neutral position” for them to continue their
                                service.</p>
                            <p>Von Schmieden went on to say that the German Government had taken
                                this step with considerable reluctance and had indeed deferred doing
                                so until the present. It had been hoped that the conflict coming to
                                a close would render such action unnecessary but that now that
                                hostilities had assumed proportions of large scale warfare, the
                                problem of neutrality became more definite. In answer to an inquiry
                                he said that he assumed that the majority of the individuals
                                involved would withdraw but that some might continue in the service.
                                He admitted that the reason why some might continue was that they
                                were presumably <hi rend="italic">persona non grata</hi> to the
                                present German Government. He said as respecting individuals that
                                the matter was somewhat complicated as each was under a separate
                                contract with the Chinese Government. He added that there were
                                numerous German nationals in civil positions under the Chinese
                                Government including ex-officers in the police services. He said
                                that none of these were involved but only those whose duties were
                                distinctly and unquestionably military.</p>
                            <p>In commenting on other matters, von Schmieden said that he had noted
                                that the United States had obtained compensation for the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Panay</hi> affair but that Berlin had been less
                                successful in obtaining repatriations [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >reparations?</hi>] which they had claimed from Tokyo and that
                                    <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0196"/>cases were still
                                pending. Respecting the recent bombing of Canton he said that he
                                could not understand Japanese terrors which were serving to unite
                                all China against them. He characterized the bombing of Canton as a
                                cheap victory and said he believed it was to place before the
                                Chinese people as an “answer” to the flight over Japanese territory
                                by Chinese planes which had made a marked impression on the Japanese
                                public. He commented on the cynicism of Tokyo in declaring that the
                                bombing of Canton was for military purposes. Although the Japanese
                                had apparently ultimately reached certain military objectives, the
                                loss of civilian life could have been avoided by an advance
                                notification.</p>
                            <p>2. The Chinese Ambassador confirmed the notifications for withdrawal
                                to German ex-officers serving with the Chinese General Staff and
                                said that on May 29 the German Embassy at Hankow had informed the
                                Chinese Foreign Office that such notifications had been issued. The
                                Ambassador had been so apprised by his Government and instructed to
                                lodge a protest with the German Government against this action. He
                                had made such a protest but as yet had received no reply.</p>
                            <p>3. It has been characteristically impossible to obtain any
                                satisfactory information respecting any possible stoppage in the
                                shipment of German military supplies to China.</p>

                            <p>Japanese air raids on Canton June 4th were probably the most
                                destructive of civilian life and property to date. Bombs were
                                dropped in the most thickly populated and busiest part of the city
                                near the Honam bridge approach, the junction of Winghorny Road and
                                Munming Road and about the civic and Government center. Officially
                                estimated 120 bombs dropped in city limits. Many buildings,
                                including part of Kwangtung Provincial Bank, were destroyed. It is
                                not possible to determine the number of civilians killed as many are
                                buried iii the ruins but the official estimate is more than 1000
                                killed and Wounded. It is possible that the objectives were the
                                Government center, the electric light plant, water plant and perhaps
                                the highway bridge to Honam Island.</p>

                            <p>Japanese air raids on Canton proper continued June 5th and 6th
                                resulting in further great loss of life, and injury to civilians and
                                damage to property. French hospital on bund partly destroyed by two
                                bombs on 6th. Several buildings and market demolished in rear
                                electric light plant but latter not hit. Bomb landing on bund in
                                front of French hospital and Y. M. C. A. killed many persons on bund
                                and in sampans. Tung warehouses bombed both days, several primary
                                and middle schools struck, and many pupils killed and injured.</p>
                            <p>Canton–Hankow station again bombed with slight damage to terminal
                                buildings but none to railway.</p>
                            <p>Canton–Kowloon Railway attacked both days but damage negligible.</p>
                            <p>I would re-emphasize that whatever the objectives Japanese claim to
                                be aiming at the only result of bombings during past week has been
                                killing and wounding of civilians and destruction of private
                                property.</p>
                            <p>The Chairman Canton Red Cross has written asking me to report that on
                                May 28th after Japanese had bombed Saikui area the planes suddenly
                                returned and machine gunned and bombed Red Cross workers and firemen
                                who were attempting to succor those wounded in first raid. Many
                                firemen and Red Cross workers were killed and wounded.</p>

                                manner in which political control is to be exercised. Seemingly Tang

                                and experience to take the lead in the new government that they will
                                go far towards meeting his requirements.</p>
                            <p>Tang told Bos that he believed the Japanese intend to place the major
                                emphasis on agrarian development with a view to improving the
                                standard of living of the Chinese farmer so that he can purchase
                                Japanese manufactured goods. Chinese raw materials will then be
                                exploited by the Japanese for use in Japan or by Japanese companies
                                in China.</p>
                            <p>As a result of his conversation, Bos believes that Tang’s attitude is
                                due to a combination of two main factors; (1) a sincere belief that
                                the good which can be accomplished for the benefit of the millions
                                of Chinese in the occupied areas will outweigh any possible
                                sacrifice Tang will make, and (2) a hatred of the Kuomintang and its
                                blue shirt terrorists who Tang states are responsible for the recent
                                murders in Shanghai of two of his close friends.</p>

                            <p>342. 1. The Japanese announce the occupation yesterday noon of
                                Kaifeng which has been seriously menaced since the close of May when
                                Yucheng, Kweiteh and Kihsien were taken in quick succession. Lanfeng
                                was reportedly evacuated by Chinese forces prior to the fall of
                                Kaifeng, thus removing a serious threat to the Doihara Division, and
                                it appears now that the second phase of the Lunghai campaign is
                                nearing a close and that a direct campaign for the capture of Hankow
                                will ensue. This probability becomes more and more real if Japanese
                                reports of a Chinese retreat from Chengchow, Honan, are true and if
                                as also claimed by the Japanese a Japanese force from east of
                                Kaifeng has cut down to the Pinghan Railway south of Chengchow.</p>
                            <p>2. The Japanese claim further to have occupied on June 6
                                Cheng-yangkuang, Anhwei, about 60 miles northwest of Hofei
                                (Luchowfu). <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0199"/>While this does
                                not bring the Japanese column operating in northern Anhwei actually
                                much nearer to Hankow (some 200 miles distant) than it was at Hofei,
                                this movement may be an important step in the advance on Hankow
                                which appears to be taking form.</p>

                            <p>The report carried in some of the newspapers alleging that there is a
                                split between Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, Commander-in-chief of
                                the Chinese army, and General Li Tsung-jen is entirely groundless.
                                It must be fabricated by an interested party with the malicious
                                intention to discredit to the world the unity of the Chinese
                                people.</p>
                            <p>The plan calling for withdrawal from certain cities which are
                                strategically difficult to defend is a part of the whole plan agreed
                                upon by all the Chinese military leaders and dovetails perfectly
                                with the pronounced policy of the Chinese Government to fight a
                                protracted war and to meet the Japanese army only in the places the
                                topography of which will not give great advantage to their
                                mechanized equipment. It has been more than once proved in the
                                history that the deep penetration of an invaded country does not
                                necessarily give advantage to the invading army. The Japanese may
                                soon find out that their deep penetration into the interior of
                                China, coupled with their employment of inhuman methods of warfare
                                by bombing ruthlessly the open towns, will find a Chinese people
                                increasingly united and more determined than ever to resist
                                them.</p>

                            <p>In response to the inquiries from the foreign correspondents,
                                Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek issued today a statement reviewing the
                                political and military situation. The following is a gist of the
                                statement.</p>
                            <p>In the past eleven months the armed resistance has fortified our
                                nation’s determination to fight and simultaneously augmented our
                                faith in the final triumph. In the first place, the whole nation is
                                solidly united as never before. The evidence of unity can be seen
                                everywhere. Even those who were formerly dissatisfied with the
                                Kuomintang (National Party) are one and all supporting the National
                                Government <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0200"/>and taking part
                                in the armed resistance. Secondly, China’s military strength has
                                been considerably increased since the outbreak of hostilities. The
                                Chinese army’s fighting strength is more than doubled; its armaments
                                are considerably improved in quality and increased in quantity.
                                China’s resistance will last as long as the Japanese continue the
                                campaign of aggression. Thirdly, the topographical advantages
                                henceforth will be more with China than with Japan. The crux of the
                                military situation is not found in the success or failure of
                                defending a particular city or area. What is vital is the ability to
                                pick advantageous battlefields where we could reduce the enemy’s
                                main strength. Our withdrawals are dictated by the necessity to
                                avoid unnecessary sacrifices. At the same time we have been forcing
                                the Japanese to give battle on the fields we have chosen. This
                                tactics is essential to the success of prolonged resistance.</p>
                            <p>The Generalissimo then stressed upon the paramount necessity for the
                                friendly nations to fulfill their treaty obligations by giving China
                                positive assistance. That the Japanese fighting forces have bombed
                                non-combatants, slaughtered prisoners of war, and even employed
                                poison are well-known facts. The treaty obligations require that the
                                friendly Powers oppose the aggression openly and in so doing they
                                merely exercise their treaty rights. If these nations could resort
                                to the application of sanctions, not only would the innocent Chinese
                                people’s suffering be lessened, but the security of future peace of
                                mankind and human justice enhanced.</p>

                                that in view of the facts that all Chinese Consulates in Japan have

                            <p>365. The Japanese spokesman admits that the Yellow River flood which
                                he states has now reached the Lunghai Railway has completely checked
                                the Japanese advance on Chengchow, Honan. He informed me that the
                                spreading water would probably make necessary the abandonment by
                                forces in the Kaifeng–Chengchow area of a southward push toward
                                Hankow down the Pinghan Railway. This would seem to indicate that
                                attacks on that railway south of Chengchow will come from the east
                                and that the direction of the main Japanese attack upon Hankow will
                                be from the east (including attack up the Yangtze and along the
                                north shore of that river).</p>

                                meeting of June 17 with the foreign press correspondents. In
                                answering questions the Minister made liberal use of a large sheaf
                                of notes which had been prepared in anticipation by the press
                                section of the Foreign Office, and most of the correspondents were
                                annoyed by the consequent lack of spontaneity in the replies. What
                                seems to be most noteworthy in Mr. Ugaki’s statements on this
                                occasion is his assertion that with sufficient change in the state
                                of affairs in China the Japanese Government might come to a
                                reconsideration of its decision not to deal with Chiang
                                Kai-shek.</p>
                            <p>This assertion bears out statements made at somewhat greater length
                                both by the Premier<note n="66" xml:id="d189fn66">Prince Fumimaro

                                interviews with Mr. John Gunther on June 2, as recounted by him to a
                                member of my staff on that date. Mr. Gunther, well known as a
                                correspondent and as author of <hi rend="italic">Inside Europe</hi>,
                                was granted <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0203"/>interviews with
                                several outstanding individuals of the present cabinet, among which
                                interviews that with Premier Konoe was particularly successful. What
                                would be the next step, asked Mr. Gunther, after the decisive defeat
                                of the Chiang Kai-shek regime which the Japanese say is their aim,
                                when the Imperial conference of January 11 committed the country to
                                a policy of no negotiating with Chiang Kai-shek? Prince Konoe’s
                                reply, according to Mr. Gunther, was that that decision was
                                specifically necessary to counteract the effect of the Trautmann
                                peace approach, which had proved itself a premature error; that the
                                decision is not beyond the possibility of change; and that Japan,
                                whose chief aim is peace, is ready to negotiate with Chiang Kai-shek
                                whenever he shows a proper attitude.</p>

                            <p>399. 1. Further intelligence and observations enable us reliably to
                                extend as follows the estimate of the recent reconstruction of the
                                Cabinet contained in our 333, May 26, midnight and 335, May 27, 6

                                respectively.</note></p>
                            <p>2. The Prime Minister and certain other members of the Cabinet had
                                long realized that if progress were to be made in bringing the China
                                campaign to a successful conclusion and in consolidating Japan’s
                                position in China without serious friction with Great Britain and
                                the United States, the control of all but purely military affairs
                                must be taken out of the hands of the military and lodged in the
                                civil part of the Government.</p>
                            <p>3. Hirota<note n="68" xml:id="d190fn68">Former Japanese Minister for
                                    Foreign Affairs.</note> fell because he was paradoxically too
                                weak in opposing certain demands of the army while at the same time
                                too intransigent in insisting that the Foreign Office which is
                                unpopular with the army must control Japan’s foreign relations
                                concerning China. By way of compromise the authorities are now in
                                process of setting up the so-called “China Organ” which is to
                                consider political, economic and other non-military affairs relating
                                to China.</p>
                            <p>4. Ugaki and Ikeda accepted office<note n="69" xml:id="d190fn69">As
                                    Ministers of Foreign Affairs and of Finance, Commerce and
                                    Industry, respectively.</note> only on condition that the
                                control of political and economic affairs in connection with China
                                should be taken out of the hands of the military. This coincided
                                with the views of Prince Konoye and further explains the appointment
                                of <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0204"/>General Itagaki as
                                Minister of War because he possesses the confidence of the younger
                                officers in the army and at the same time believes that the army
                                should stay out of politics and should attend exclusively to its
                                duties as an efficient fighting machine.</p>
                            <p>5. Both Ugaki and Ikeda realize that the solution of Japan’s problems
                                in China will be difficult unless good relations are maintained with
                                Great Britain and the United States. Ugaki therefore proposes to do
                                all in his power to ensure the protection of the respective
                                interests of those and other foreign countries at least to the
                                extent of reducing friction to a minimum.</p>
                            <p>6. With regard to economic affairs the purpose of the setting up of
                                the North China Development Company and the Central China Promotion
                                Company is to take these matters also out of the hands of the
                                military. It is intended that these companies shall function under
                                the general direction of the “China Organ”.</p>
                            <p>7. With reference to point 5 above we have recently seen indications
                                of Ugaki’s desire to remove causes of friction with the United
                                States in connection with American interests in China. Having in
                                mind the arbitrariness of the army and navy it is hardly to be
                                expected that the Foreign Minister will be able to accomplish this
                                desirable end rapidly or completely. Nevertheless while omitting no
                                proper step ourselves and while continuing to make official
                                representations as specific cases and developments arise, I have
                                felt it desirable to avoid bringing early pressure to bear on the
                                Minister while closely watching the working out of his efforts. I
                                have therefore confined our recent representation to interviews with
                                the Vice Minister and other officials of the Foreign Office with the
                                idea of “saving ammunition” for an eventual frank discussion with
                                Ugaki on the whole field of American interests in China along
                                general lines.<note n="70" xml:id="d190fn70">See also <ref

                                add weight to such an interview when it takes place. I see no good
                                reason why such an interview should not take place in the near
                                future and suggest, if the Department concurs, that an up-to-date
                                outline of American desiderata be cabled me for use at an opportune
                                moment. The Embassy is presumably in possession of all or most of
                                the data which might be used for such an interview but I feel that
                                an instruction from the Department would be helpful in indicating
                                the specific issues which should be brought forward in such a
                                general discussion and the relative emphasis to be placed upon them
                                as reflecting the views of the American Government. This telegram is

                            <p>401. 1. The <hi rend="italic">Nichi Nichi</hi> states today that, in
                                connection with criticism during a recent press interview by the
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs of those countries supplying arms to
                                China, Ugaki has under active consideration the possibility of a
                                Japanese declaration of war against China. It is argued in the
                                article that, although Ugaki has indicated that he is endeavoring to
                                attain the desired end through diplomatic channels, it is unlikely
                                that the countries concerned can be persuaded to refrain from
                                exercising their right to supply arms to China unless Japan offers
                                satisfactory <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo;</hi> but that he could
                                force these countries to weigh more carefully the advantages and
                                disadvantages of this practice if war were declared. The army and
                                navy further states that diplomatic officials in the field have been
                                instructed to submit to Tokyo all data necessary for final decision
                                on the matter.</p>
                            <p>2. As we have stated on several occasions, the question of a
                                declaration of war will revolve around the effects on the military
                                operations of imports of munitions by China. We believe that this
                                aspect of the question has all around been kept under observation,
                                and that, if China’s imports of arms are now such as to be an
                                important factor in the continuation by China of its resistance,
                                declaration of war might well be under active consideration.
                                However, it would be well to bear in mind that today’s story appears
                                in no other paper, which indicates at least that the Government is
                                not actively interested in giving it publicity. It seems to us that
                                the story may have some basis in fact, but that it has not been
                                presented in accurate perspective.</p>
                            <p>3. The spokesman of the Foreign Office is reported as having
                                characterized the <hi rend="italic">Nichi Nichi</hi> story as
                                groundless and false, adding that Japan could not declare war on
                                China unless she discontinues adherence to various treaties
                                concerned, including the Kellogg-Briand Peace Pact and the Nine
                                Power Treaty “by which she is now bound”.</p>
                            <p>4. We are, of course, endeavoring to obtain some authoritative
                                information on the subject, which the Department will realize is no
                                easy matter. The only suggestion which we have obtained directly
                                from Japanese official sources thus far is that the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Nichi Nichi</hi> story “should not be taken too
                                seriously”.</p>

                            <p>312. Chief of German advisers informed McHugh today that on June 22nd
                                he had been called to the German Embassy along with Hsu Mo, Vice
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs, and that in the presence of the Vice
                                Minister German Ambassador had delivered to him an ultimatum to be
                                answered within 24 hours. Ultimatum was that failure of advisers to
                                sever connections with the Chinese Government and return to Germany
                                at once would be regarded as high treason punishable by deprivation
                                of citizenship and confiscation of personal property and possibly
                                other penalties. German Government demanded that they abrogate their
                                contracts if Chinese Government refused, promising favorable
                                treatment and reemployment in Germany. This applied to all military
                                advisers of whom none would be permitted to remain.</p>

                            <p>313. Tokyo’s 399, June 22, noon. In my opinion the situation of
                                American citizens and their interests in China will be much improved
                                if the Japanese can be persuaded to adopt a more reasonable attitude
                                towards civilians generally. Civilian enterprise and interests in
                                the cities and noncombatants in the country areas appear to be
                                specially marked for attention. This is particularly true of
                                hospitals, schools and relief work in which American missionaries
                                are prominently interested in Central China.</p>

                                    prevent there arising an impression that this Government’s

                                    impelled the Japanese to direct their land advance along the

                                    immediate objective is the Matang barrier and whence a drive
                                    will probably be attempted via Nanchang to Changsha and then
                                    north along Hankow-Canton Railway. Stiff Chinese resistance and
                                    some Chinese success in counter-attacks near Matang are reported
                                    and Chinese reports claim also continuing aerial success in

                                    bombing Wuhu and Anking air fields. The presaged land attack on

                            <p>422. Department’s 212, June 25, 4 p.m., paragraph 2. I learn on
                                completely reliable authority that Ikeda is determined that the
                                “China Organ” and the two companies mentioned shall not follow the
                                Manchurian pattern by excluding non-Japanese enterprise from the
                                occupied areas of North and Central China. He has stated
                                categorically in privacy that the reconstruction of China without
                                foreign cooperation would be impossible and that he will insist upon
                                observance of the principle of the Open Door. It is for this very
                                reason that the effort is being made to take these matters out of
                                the hands of the army.</p>
                            <p>Likewise Kodama, who has been appointed to head the Central China
                                Promotion Company, states privately but categorically that he shares
                                Ikeda’s views and that as his opinions are well known his selection
                                would have been impossible if the Government had intended to
                                institute a monopolistic system.</p>
                            <p>Naturally I am disinclined to accept such assurances at their face
                                value but the wind appears at least to be blowing in the right
                                direction. I shall discuss this subject with the Minister for

                                the French Ambassador in London recently told the British Foreign

                                mere diplomatic representations and expressed the hope that the
                                British Government would cooperate. When asked what sort of step his
                                Government visualized, however, Corbin pleaded ignorance. No
                                Anglo-French understanding on this issue appears therefore to have
                                been reached.</p>
                            <p>2. Craigie yesterday took occasion to bring up with the Minister for

                                present intention to occupy Hainan but that if in the course of the
                                advance on Hankow or a later advance on Canton such occupation
                                should become a strategic necessity it would take place. The
                                Minister, however, said that such occupation would be temporary and
                                repeated to Craigie the former categorical assurances of the
                                Japanese Government that the territorial integrity of China will be
                                respected both as to the mainland and the islands.</p>
                            <p>3. Craigie informs me that there can be no question but that great
                                quantities of arms and ammunition are coming into China from French
                                Indo-China by different routes, a considerable amount being smuggled
                                by Chinese junks. He believes that most of this material is
                                contraband and that a great amount of graft is involved in the
                                process of importation. This is one of the chief problems with which
                                the Japanese now have to cope.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Yoshida, the Japanese Ambassador, who asked for an appointment to
                                see me, came at ten o’clock this morning. He began by expressing
                                regret that on account of my illness he had been unable to see me
                                and have a talk with me in Paris on my return from the Brussels
                                Conference last Fall.</p>
                            <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0212"/>
                            <p>What he wanted to talk with me about then, he said, was to urge us
                                and the British to persuade his and the Chinese governments to
                                accept our mediation in the settlement of the Sino-Japanese
                                conflict; and it seemed even more important to him now than it did
                                then and, also, that he was satisfied that his government would be
                                more receptive than ever to accept such mediation.</p>
                            <p>I explained to him that just now I was here on Red Cross work alone,
                                and was not in a position to speak for our government on this
                                subject, or to discuss any such proposed step. He said he knew I was
                                here just on Red Cross but that he wanted to talk to me frankly, as
                                he had always done, and he proceeded to insist that he knew now that
                                his government would welcome mediation; that he had been talking to
                                the British government and urging them to offer to intervene; that
                                while the British had been willing to discuss it, they had not shown
                                any enthusiasm and were constantly intimating that they would not
                                take any step without the United States. He was therefore in hopes
                                that as a result of his talk with me, he could send word to his
                                government that the United States would be favorably inclined to
                                make such a move.</p>
                            <p>I told him that I could give him no such word whatever and that, in
                                fact, the last time such a matter was discussed, we had come to the
                                conclusion that it would not be wise or practicable to inject
                                ourselves to that extent in the situation, at least unless there
                                were reasons to believe that Japan and China would welcome mediation
                                and that it would be possible, as a result of mediation, to arrive
                                at a constructive and mutually acceptable solution; that while I
                                could only express my own personal views, it seemed tome that the
                                issue between China and Japan was so fundamental that it was not
                                susceptible of a compromise that would remove the issue.</p>
                            <p>I asked him if he thought the Japanese militarists had either
                                concluded that they could not conquer China, or that they should
                                abandon the determination to dominate China; or if the Chinese were
                                getting in a state of mind where they would be willing, in fact, to
                                accept Japanese control and abandon their own efforts to maintain
                                their independence. He said the militarists were drawn into that
                                conflict; that they had thought they could inflict enough punishment
                                on China quickly to bring her to her senses, but that they had never
                                contemplated getting in so deep as they had, and that while he was
                                not sure just what their state of mind is now, he was confident that
                                the Army was losing prestige in Japan and that through mediation by
                                Great Britain and the United States, the people would support the
                                government in any reasonable settlement; that while the Army had
                                gained <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0213"/>public support by
                                conquering Manchuria, which had not been possible through diplomatic
                                negotiations, the Army had overplayed its hand and public opinion
                                was turning against them.</p>
                            <p>I asked him what kind of a settlement did he think possible. He
                                thought that the recognition of Manchukoa and the creation of a
                                buffer state in North China, as security to Manchukoa; and a
                                cessation of anti-Japanese propaganda, and cooperation for the
                                economic rehabilitation of China, with some kind of guarantee. I
                                told him my personal reaction to that was doubt as to whether China
                                would accept; a question as to whether a mediator would be willing
                                to support such a program; and as to what he meant by “guarantee.”
                                He said his idea of a “guarantee” was one in which Great Britain and
                                the United States and China all recognized the special position of
                                Japan, and would enter into an agreement for joint efforts toward
                                economic rehabilitation. He felt that when Japan had captured Hankow
                                would be the psychological moment for offering mediation because
                                China would probably then be more amenable to reason and also Japan;
                                that while China had suffered greatly in a material way, Japan was
                                suffering, mentally, and he was confident that the time would soon
                                come when England and America could, if they would, successfully
                                urge China and Japan to accept mediation. I asked him if he thought
                                England would be willing to mediate alone and he said he did not
                                think so.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, I told him that I could in no way speak for the
                                American government on this question but that, personally, I could
                                not give him any encouragement, and the situation itself did not as
                                yet look encouraging to me.</p>

                                China with arms and munitions on credit. He asserted that six
                                Japanese divisions had lost all their heavy artillery and tanks as a
                                result of the Yellow River inundations. He added that he believed
                                that the Japanese offensive against Hankow would be held up for many
                                months and reaffirmed the determination of the Chinese Government to

                                    <p>The Minister after listening to my complete representations
                                        said that he wished to express appreciation of the manner of
                                        my approach. He would take a further opportunity to discuss
                                        the points which I had raised. These points required most
                                        careful investigation, consideration and detailed
                                        examination. For the present he wished to make the following
                                        comments.</p>
                                    <p>The Japanese Government is making whole-hearted efforts to
                                        settle the conflict and to secure peace in East Asia at the
                                        earliest possible moment. The Minister hopes that we
                                        understand that desire.</p>

                                            discussion and we must understand each other on a basis
                                            of mutual fairness and justice.</item>

                                on special train provided by the Chinese Government.</p>
                            <p>It is understood that on July 2 a banquet was given in their honor by
                                the Generalissimo and on July 4 by the Minister of War. The press
                                reports today that the Chinese Government, appreciating the
                                difficult position in which the advisers were placed, had
                                voluntarily released them from their unexpired contracts.</p>
                            <p>A Chinese Government spokesman is quoted in the press today as
                                follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            <p>It is estimated that over seventy-five percent of the military
                                supplies imported into China since the start of the hostilities have
                                been routed through Hong Kong. The routes of entry for the remainder
                                in order of their importance are French Indo-China, Russian
                                Turkestan, Kwangchowan (French leased territory on the Kwangtung <pb

                                of Hong Kong), Macao, and Burma. A negligible amount of military
                                supplies may enter China from Siberia via Urga. Small quantities may
                                pass through the Japanese blockade into ports on the China
                                Coast.</p>
                            <p>Extensive road and railway construction and improvement are now in
                                progress with a view toward bettering communications with countries
                                bordering China and so facilitate shipments of military supplies. In
                                Yunnan, the caravan route from Talifu to Burma is being improved
                                into a road suitable for wheeled traffic, and an extensive road net
                                is being constructed connecting Yunnanfu, the terminus of the French
                                railway from Hanoi, with roads leading north, east and west. In
                                Kwangsi railroads and roads are under construction connecting the
                                railway terminus at Langson, French Indo-China, with the
                                Canton-Hankow railway via Nanning and Kweilin. The long route from
                                Russian Turkestan has in large part been made suitable for heavy
                                hauls in all weathers.</p>

                                been imported since the start of hostilities.</p>
                            <p>Germany, until its recent decision to cease shipping munitions to
                                China, furnished the largest percentage as well as the largest
                                variety of military supplies. Other countries furnishing munitions
                                in order of their probable importance are Russia, Italy, England,
                                France, United States, Belgium, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, and
                                Denmark. The heavy German participation in the munition trade to
                                China is probably due to a barter agreement between the two
                                countries concluded in 1935 and to the presence of the German
                                advisers. Practically all the materials purchased from Germany can
                                be procured elsewhere provided China can secure the necessary credit
                                or provide foreign exchange.</p>
                            <p>Chinese claim they now have sufficient supplies on hand for one more
                                year of warfare.</p>
                            <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0219"/>
                            <p>It is believed that the military supplies now being imported into
                                China together with the reserve on hand are sufficient to maintain
                                the Chinese forces in defensive operations on the present extensive
                                scale. It is estimated that a minimum reserve of four months’ supply
                                of essential military supplies are now in China either in arsenals
                                and supply dumps or en route thereto.</p>
                            <p>From the standpoint of supply, continued large scale Chinese
                                operations are contingent upon the maintenance of China’s purchasing
                                power abroad, upon keeping the present route via Hong Kong open
                                until efficient substitute routes can be established, and upon
                                continued Chinese occupation of the areas containing important
                                Government arsenals, particularly those in the Hankow area.</p>

                                of practically all military and police protection together with a
                                part of the Shanghai volunteer forces including the Russian company
                                to prevent disorder, yesterday was one of the tensest days spent in
                                Shanghai for some time. Hundreds of suspects were arrested by the
                                Settlement and French police authorities and close patrols were
                                maintained throughout the day and night. The French police arrested
                                a Chinese in whose possession was found a hand grenade. The arrested
                                Chinese, at French police headquarters, confessed to being one of a
                                group of Chinese terrorists sent to Shanghai from Hankow, with the
                                necessary equipment, to create terrorism in the Settlement and
                                French Concession. There is a common belief in the city that the
                                organized terrorism that has prevailed in the city for the past
                                several weeks, which was particularly flagrant yesterday, has been
                                instigated by the Hankow authorities. This belief is so strong that
                                the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Cornell S.
                                    Franklin,<note n="95" xml:id="d206fn95">American lawyer.</note>
                                came to see me this morning and requested that this phase of the
                                matter be brought to the attention of the Department with a view to
                                the Department instructing the Ambassador at Hankow to bring the
                                matter to the attention of the Chinese authorities there. Mr.
                                Franklin emphasized the fact that, in spite of every effort of the
                                police of the Settlement to prevent terrorism, the neutrality of the
                                Settlement has repeatedly been violated by such acts. He further
                                pointed out that <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0220"/>the
                                Settlement police have done their utmost to protect the vast amount
                                of Chinese property in the Settlement as well as the property of all
                                others. He believes that the Hankow authorities should cooperate in
                                every possible way with the Settlement authorities in preventing
                                acts of terrorism and he asks the help of the American authorities
                                to that end in the manner suggested above. He has also discussed the
                                matter with the British Consul General who lis referring it as
                                requested.</p>

                                Shanghai Settlement. The Department suggests that you consult with
                                your British colleague in regard to this matter. If you feel that
                                you can with propriety do so and your British colleague is prepared
                                to take substantially similar action, you are authorized to bring to
                                the attention of the Chinese Government informally the facts and
                                considerations mentioned in Shanghai’s telegram under reference and

                                so far as the Chinese Government has any contributory responsibility
                                in relation to these developments, that such acts and their
                                consequences are not only harmful to other countries, including
                                those friendly to China, but are contrary to the best interests of

                                non-Americans unless instructed to do so by the Department. In the

                                afternoon in regard to this matter. He tells me that he received
                                similar message from his Consul General yesterday just before going
                                to keep an appointment with the Generalissimo and that he put
                                message in pocket and read it to Chiang who stated that while he
                                disclaimed any connection with these crimes he assured the British
                                Ambassador that he would use all of his influence to prevent their
                                occurrence. In view of the above it seems to us both that nothing
                                further needed be done at this time. If Consulate at Shanghai using
                                the above in any information conveyed to Chairman of Municipal
                                Council he should impress upon Chairman desirability of avoiding any
                                publicity regarding appeal to us or to representations made.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Japan’s relations with France, which
                                have been unusually quiescent since the outbreak of the present
                                Sino-Japanese hostilities, have recently come to the fore and French
                                policies and actions in the Far East have been attacked in the local
                                press with vehemence. In fact, the tone of bitterness and editorial
                                vituperation suddenly directed against France, whose attitude of
                                strict neutrality and impartiality had previously elicited approving
                                comment, reveals a sensitiveness and a state of nerves on the part
                                of the press somewhat out of proportion to the offenses alleged;
                                this, in turn, may be an indication that the strain of the past
                                year’s hostilities has been greater upon the Japanese than they
                                themselves have suspected.</p>
                            <p>In general, the criticism is based on an allegation by the Japanese
                                that France, whose precarious position in Europe is now so greatly
                                dependent upon the closest possible association with Great Britain,
                                has seen fit to follow British policy in the Far East and that
                                France has now aligned itself with Great Britain in endeavoring to
                                obstruct the unfolding of Japan’s plans in China.</p>
                            <p>Specific complaints are based upon allegations that France has agreed
                                to extend loans to China and to send to China military officers who
                                would take the place of the German military advisers who have been
                                recalled by the German Government. The Japanese furthermore complain
                                that there has been a marked increase in the shipment of arms and
                                munitions to China through Indo-China, especially since France
                                appears virtually to have ceased supplying the Spanish Government
                                with war material which has now become available for sale to the
                                Chiang Kai-shek régime. Mr. Sugimura, Japanese Ambassador at Paris,
                                is reported to have protested to the French Foreign Minister against
                                the use of the Yunnanfu Railway for this purpose and to have
                                deprecated the alleged agreement concluded between the French and
                                the Chinese governments for the construction of a new railway from
                                Chennankwan, French Indo-China, to Nanning in Kwangsi Province,
                                China.</p>
                            <p>In a conversation between the Counselor of the French Embassy and a
                                member of the staff of this Embassy, Baron Fain remarked that the
                                contract for the construction of this new railway had actually been
                                signed prior to the outbreak of the present hostilities, that it was
                                a purely private business enterprise in which the French Government
                                felt it could not interfere, and that it would in any case be at
                                least two years before the construction would be completed.
                                Continuing <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0223"/>the conversation
                                the Counselor said that such arms as were at present being shipped
                                over the railway to Yunnanfu represented the fulfillment of regular
                                contracts for the sale of arms to China which had likewise been
                                entered into before the outbreak of hostilities. He maintained that
                                there was no smuggling of arms or munitions across the Indo-China
                                frontier. (See our telegram No. 423, June 28, 8 p.m.)</p>
                            <p>Questioned concerning the reports that French military advisers would
                                replace the departing German military advisers to Chiang Kai-shek, a
                                further source of considerable concern to the Japanese, the
                                Counselor said that he had no information on the matter but that, in
                                his personal opinion, there was no truth in the report; that
                                France’s policy of strict neutrality was being adhered to and that
                                such action as alleged above would not be consistent with this
                                policy. He said that there were, of course, a few free-lance
                                individuals of French nationality who, like soldiers of fortune from
                                other countries, were serving in various capacities in the Chinese
                                air force and armies but that they had no significance. He thought
                                that possibly the recent arrival of one or two of these individuals
                                from Spain may have been made the basis for the rumor that France
                                intended to supply military advisers to the Chinese Government.</p>
                            <p>Other irritants in the question of Japanese-French relations have
                                been the increasing French concern in the possible occupation by the
                                Japanese of the island of Hainan (see our telegram No. 423, June 28,
                                8 p.m.) and the landing by the French of ten Annamite policemen and
                                the establishment of a lighthouse and a wireless station on the
                                Paracel Islands, a scattered group of tiny islets and reefs some 120
                                miles to the southeast of Hainan. The sovereignty of the Paracels is
                                under dispute between the French and the Chinese; the French,
                                however, maintain that title to those islands lay with the former
                                Kingdom of Annam by virtue of a treaty between that Kingdom and
                                China and that when France took over Annam the title to the Paracels
                                passed to the French. The Japanese claim no title but sustain the
                                Chinese claim that the islands are Chinese. At all events, the
                                recent action of the French in landing policemen on the Islands was
                                made the subject of a formal protest by the Foreign Office here
                                through the French Ambassador on July 4, and the Vice Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs is reported, in an official communique later issued
                                by the Foreign Office, to have said that he “called attention of the
                                French Government to the possibility that the stationing of the
                                Annamese policemen in the (Paracel) Islands was likely to give rise
                                to some unexpected misunderstanding between them and the Japanese
                                engaged in the work mentioned above (collection of sea-weed and rock
                                phosphates), and expressed the hope that the said police force would
                                be withdrawn”. The nature of the French reply to these
                                representations is not known but the Embassy understands that the
                                Japanese request will be rejected.</p>

                            <p>In the non-political field a further difficulty has interjected
                                itself in the form of the imposition by the French of retaliatory
                                measures banning further importation into France of certain Japanese
                                commercial products hitherto admitted under quotas. In February of
                                this year an arrangement was entered into between the two countries
                                by which Japan undertook to import from France during 1938 goods to
                                a value not less than the value of the import figures for the
                                calendar year 1936. A survey of the figures for the first six months
                                of this year shows that the Japanese have fallen considerably short
                                of the necessary imports; consequently the foregoing measures have
                                been taken by way of retaliation. French trade with Japan has for
                                some years in the past shown a balance consistently adverse to
                                France. The arrangement of last February was entered into for the
                                purpose of restricting the amount of this adverse balance but with
                                no thought of attempting to convert this into a favorable balance;
                                the arrangement provided that if the Japanese imports should fall
                                short of the specified amount the measures which have now been taken
                                should be put into effect, pending further negotiations in an
                                endeavor to remedy the situation. In 1936 Japan sold to France goods
                                to the value of Yen 43,475,000 and bought goods to the amount of Yen
                                19,898,000. During the first four months of 1938, imports from
                                France amounted to Yen 5,101,000 as compared with Yen 7,327,000 for
                                the same period last year; exports to France amounted to Yen
                                11,221,000 as compared with Yen 15,150,000 for the same period last
                                year. It is understood that the Japanese will seek to negotiate a
                                new arrangement.</p>

                                Generalissimo with a message from her father congratulating him upon
                                his stiff resistance to Japanese. She then visited Wang Ching

                                go to Hong Kong to confer with her father with regard to possible
                                mediation and peace. Wang is reported <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221"
                                    facs="0225"/>to have declined the invitation and to have
                                informed Generalissimo of approach. Donald stated that some time
                                before Wang had been approached through some other and unnamed
                                source with the suggestion that he write directly to Prince Konoye
                                to assure him that there would be no enmity between them after
                                hostilities were over. This Wang is said also to have refused to do
                                and to have informed the Generalissimo of approach and of his
                                decision. Donald interpreted the above as efforts by the Japanese to
                                separate some of the leaders in the present Government. Donald
                                stated that Japanese would even be willing now to permit
                                Generalissimo to remain as a power behind the scenes as long as
                                hostilities are over.</p>
                            <p>In recent conversations which I have had with British Ambassador who
                                is now in Hankow, I found him interested in the question as to
                                whether the present Chinese Government could hold together after
                                loss of Hankow. Today I had a conversation with Blackburn<note n="3"
                                    xml:id="d211fn3">Sir A. D, Blackburn, Chinese Secretary of the
                                    British Embassy in China.</note> who arrived yesterday from
                                Shanghai to join British Ambassador. Blackburn, who at Nanking was
                                inclined to criticise his Ambassador for a tendency to spend too
                                much time away from Nanking and the Central Government, seemed now
                                to feel that it was necessary for him to keep his Ambassador from
                                being too enthusiastic about Chinese Government’s chances of
                                success. Blackburn appeared to believe that there was likelihood
                                that Wang Ching Wei and possibly Tar Chi Tao might leave Government
                                to find berths for themselves with Japanese fostered regimes in
                                occupied areas. I inferred that he was informed of Tang Shao Yi’s
                                overtures. I have observed no evidence here of any tendency or
                                likelihood of break up among leaders of Government. I pointed out to
                                Blackburn that I would attach much more significance to efforts to
                                bring leaders like the Generalissimo, Chu Teh, Mao Tse Tung, Li
                                Tsung Jen or Pai Chung Hsi<note n="4" xml:id="d211fn4">Two Communist
                                    and two Kwangsi leaders, all generals.</note> over to the
                                Japanese side as the Government always had been embarrassed in its
                                relations with these leaders because of the presence in it of
                                leaders like Wang Ching Wei. I pointed out that while I was by no
                                means confident of the ability of the present Chinese Government to
                                drive the Japanese out of China or even to control the activities of
                                the growing mass of guerrillas throughout the whole occupied areas,
                                I was convinced that resistance would continue for a long time with
                                the Generalissimo growing as a leader and a symbol of Chinese
                                nationalism as opposed to a Japanese controlled China. Blackburn
                                stated that the Chinese leaders were not [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >now?</hi>] much worried over the danger of the collapse of
                                Chinese currency, saying that this was evidenced by Chinese
                                insistence that China must have financial support through a British
                                or other foreign loan, that the Chinese were worried lest with the
                                collapse <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0226"/>of the currency
                                the Government would not have the wherewithal to pay its troops. I
                                pointed out that while it was natural for the Chinese Government to
                                desire to obtain a loan to assist in maintaining its credit abroad
                                and its currency in foreign exchange I saw less reason for the
                                Chinese Government to be disturbed over the possible collapse of the
                                currency than for the Japanese. I pointed out that a collapse of
                                Chinese currency would be far more disastrous to the Japanese
                                fostered Chinese regimes than it would be to the Central Government
                                which would still be able to pay its soldiers with a currency usable
                                within the areas under its control. I stated that I could not yet
                                see any basis for peace between the Chinese Government and the
                                Japanese, that I believed and feared that the struggle would go on
                                for a long time with disastrous results to everyone’s interests. I
                                agreed that there was no evidence of war weariness in Japan but
                                pointed out that the change in the Japanese Government brought about
                                by the failure of the Hsuchow campaign (loss of advantage of dry
                                spring weather for pushing attack on Lunghai and Hankow), the
                                putting into operation of the mobilization law now, a law obtained
                                by deceiving the Diet, was in my opinion a measure not so much
                                precautionary on the part of the Japanese Government as a measure of
                                desperation, saying that if at the end of a year the Japanese
                                Government had been forced to mobilize its entire strength for a
                                drive on Hankow I wondered what would be left to mobilize for the
                                long haul that must follow the capture of Hankow, the rehabilitation
                                in the occupied areas, et cetera. I report the above as possibly
                                indicating not only that the Japanese are very anxious to find some
                                way of stopping the present hostilities but also as possibly
                                indicating a feeling in the British Embassy that Chinese resistance
                                is about to break up, to be followed by a drift of leaders toward
                                the Japanese controlled regimes, a feeling which I do not share.</p>

                                information, received from foreign missionaries in the provinces of
                                Shansi, Shantung, and Hopei, which shows widespread and ruthless
                                destruction of towns and villages and considerable killing and
                                wounding of Chinese civilians by Japanese military. So extensive has
                                the destruction been during recent months in some areas that it
                                would seem that some units of the Japanese military have adopted a
                                definite policy of destruction, the purposes being one or more of
                                the following: retaliation against civilians who have
                                harbored—willingly or unwillingly—Chinese irregulars, impoverishing
                                of the countryside so that Chinese irregulars will find subsistence
                                difficult, and terrorization of the people so that they will be
                                frightened into refusing aid to irregulars.</p>

                                methodical destruction by various Japanese military units of towns,
                                villages, and isolated houses took place in the middle of April;
                                that the destruction was evidently a planned maneuver as several
                                Japanese units acted simultaneously; that he personally knew of the
                                destruction of five hsien towns (Wuhsiang, Yuhsia, Heshun, Chinchow,
                                and Hsiangyuan) and probably a sixth (Chinhsien); that towns,
                                villages, and isolated houses lying along the roads connecting the
                                district-towns (which are sometimes 30 miles apart) had also been
                                largely destroyed, although sometimes the fires set by the Japanese
                                military were not as effective as intended; that there were few
                                Chinese in the district towns at the time of the entry of Japanese
                                forces because the Chinese authorities, having prior information of
                                Japanese approach, had effected evacuation of civilians; that,
                                however, in some other towns and villages prior information was not
                                received, as a result of which there were some civilian casualties,
                                especially Chinese whose movements were regarded as suspicious by
                                Japanese; that in some instances Japanese destroyed food stocks;
                                that the Japanese forces withdrew after firing the area, allegedly
                                for service in south Shantung; that the Chinese authorities soon
                                returned; that the district town in which <pb n="224"
                                    xml:id="pg_224" facs="0228"/>he lived (Liaochow) was not
                                destroyed, although many villages in Liaochow district were burned;
                                and that the Japanese also intentionally destroyed some temples. The
                                informant took photographs of four of the destroyed hsien towns,
                                prints of which are enclosed,<note n="5" xml:id="d213fn5">Not
                                    reproduced.</note> as well as prints indicating treatment of
                                villages, isolated residences, and temples.</p>
                            <p>Another foreign missionary (Canadian), stationed at Luan, in
                                southeast Shansi but further south than the area referred to in
                                previous paragraphs, traveled this spring from Luan to Wuan, in the
                                northern tip of Honan Province. He informed a reliable American
                                missionary that towns and villages along the more than seventy miles
                                of the road which he followed had been destroyed by Japanese.</p>

                            <p>Similar destruction, although probably not so systematic, has taken
                                place in Shantung. An American missionary, stationed at Tsinan,
                                whose mission district extends south to Taian, has informed the
                                Embassy that he has received too many reports from responsible
                                Chinese not to believe that in his mission district the Japanese
                                military have burned villages, shot down civilian men, and raped the
                                women, sometimes bayonetting the women after rape. A European
                                priest, stationed along the Tsinan-Tsingtao Railway, wrote recently
                                to an American friend in Peiping that he saw from a point in his
                                district fifteen villages burning simultaneously, fired by Japanese.
                                The bombing by Japanese planes of towns and villages in northeastern
                                Shantung which are still under Chinese control has already been
                                reported by the Consulates at Chefoo and Tsingtao. It is understood
                                that the Japanese are still pursuing this practise.</p>

                            <p>Destruction—partial or complete—of towns and villages in Hopei
                                Province has previously been reported by the Embassy. Destruction
                                has reportedly been most thorough east and west of the P’inghan
                                Railway in the general area of Paoting. However, an American
                                missionary stationed at Shuntehfu on the P’inghan Railway in
                                southern Hopei has informed the Embassy that similar destruction has
                                occurred west of the railway in his area. A missionary in eastern
                                Hopei southwest of Tientsin stated some time ago that the Japanese
                                policy of destruction of towns and villages in his area was
                                evidently being abandoned, a report which indicated that the policy
                                had been in force prior to that time.</p>

                            <p>2. Inasmuch as it is decided to issue the proclamation on July 16, I
                                should be glad to have the Department’s immediate instructions as to
                                whether I should acquiesce in the regulations, with a reiteration of
                                the reservation stated in the last sentence of the penultimate
                                paragraph of my 972, July 9, 5 p.m. My British colleague will make a
                                similar reservation as regards British subjects. Otherwise he is
                                disposed to give his consent to the issuance of the proclamation in
                                the form herein quoted. I am myself disposed to make no formal
                                acquiescence, simply leaving the matter of the issuance of the
                                proclamation entirely to the discretion of the Shanghai Municipal
                                Council, but keeping on record the reservation above mentioned.</p>

                                Information Committee of the Central Publicity Board, appears to be
                                satisfactory.</p>
                            <p>In expressing appreciation for the aid heretofore rendered to China,
                                the Chinese Generalissimo reminds the signatories of the League
                                Covenant, the Pact of Paris, and the Nine Power Treaty of their
                                commitments thereunder and urges upon them the desirability of
                                implementing their pledges in order “that world justice and
                                righteousness may be firmly re-established.”</p>
                            <p>General Chiang expresses the conviction that “justice will triumph in
                                the end,” and reaffirms the determination of the Chinese people to
                                continue the war of resistance “until Japan withdraws her invading
                                forces and until we recover our territorial and administrative
                                rights.” In closing his plea to the friendly foreign powers, General
                                Chiang asserts that “peace is indivisible and isolation is
                                impracticable,” and that “as long as Japan’s aggression is
                                unchecked, the Far East and the world will remain in turmoil.” He
                                therefore urges the powers to discharge their responsibilities in
                                maintaining justice in the world and the sanctity of treaties.</p>

                            <p>360. The following is the substance of views communicated to a member
                                of my staff by Mr. Hall-Patch, Financial Adviser to the British
                                Embassy in China, who has recently arrived in Hankow after visit to
                                North China and Japan.</p>
                            <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>He reports British traders in North China have not been
                                    appreciably affected by recent financial developments in that
                                    area but is apprehensive that Japanese may endeavor to obtain
                                    control of foreign exchange derived from exports, a large
                                    portion of which remains in foreign hands and which provides
                                    bulk of cover for payment of foreign imports. He says advantages
                                    derived by Japanese importers as a result of the linking of the
                                    Federal Reserve currency and the yen are not so marked as would
                                    appear in view of shortage of commodities, transport
                                    difficulties, et cetera, but he feels foreign traders in North
                                    China ultimately may have to cooperate as best they can with the
                                    Japanese, eschewing the support of their Governments.
                                    Alternatively, the foreign powers must take steps to see that
                                    their nationals are afforded equal opportunity to trade in North
                                    China. He believes United States and Great Britain are now faced
                                    with a situation requiring a decision as to whether they will
                                    choose to cooperate with the Japanese in so far as possible in
                                    North China or whether they will choose to support China with a
                                    view to furtherance trade and position. He personally believes
                                    and has suggested to his superiors that to support China is the
                                    best policy to pursue, but is not sanguine as to London’s
                                    policy.</item>

                                <item>With regard to the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank,
                                    Hall-Patch expresses the view that this move was a mistake and
                                    says that while informed Japanese share this opinion the extent
                                    to which the situation has developed and the question of face
                                    will preclude dissolution of the bank. He believes a similar
                                    organ will not be created in Central China.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>He is of the opinion that the fall in the exchange value of
                                    the Chinese dollar has been as disastrous in its effects in the
                                    Japanese occupied areas as in Chinese Government controlled
                                    territory and that this fact has exerted a weakening influence
                                    on the yen. If Chinese currency should collapse completely, he
                                    thinks the Japanese would find it necessary to establish a new
                                    currency in China, an action which Japan would find difficult of
                                    accomplishment in view of her own financial troubles.</item>

                                <item>He considers that Japan is now beginning to feel the strain of
                                    hostilities in China. He says that if the United States and
                                    Great Britain should at this time apply a system of sanctions
                                    effectively blocking the supply of important commodities and
                                    credits to Japan, he is convinced Japan could be brought to
                                    terms within a year. He believes British Government has given
                                    consideration to this matter but would act only with full
                                    collaboration of the United States.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>He states he learned in Japan that the Standard Vacuum Oil
                                    Company recently extended old or granted new credits to Japan
                                    for the purchase of petroleum, apparently in contravention of a
                                    tacit agreement to consult beforehand with the Asiatic Petroleum
                                    Company which seems to have received advice from London not to
                                    grant further credits to Japan. Hall-Patch deplores this split
                                    in the policy of the oil companies, as the British firm must
                                    follow suit in order to preserve its position in Japan, all of
                                    which is tantamount to affording active aid to Japan in a time
                                    of great need. He moreover believes the extension of credits to
                                    Japan at this juncture is a dangerous risk. Without foreign
                                    assistance and the continuation of hostilities, he considers
                                    that Japan’s financial structure will collapse within another 12
                                    to 18 months.</item>

                                <item>It would be appreciated if the Department will endeavor to

                                <item>A well informed official of the National Government who has
                                    close connection with Tang Shao Yi’s family has informed an
                                    officer of the Embassy that: (1) Tang is distinctly a
                                    probability; (2) Tang’s son-in-law, who was a schoolmate of
                                    Konoye, visited Japan and North China not long ago in connection
                                    with Tang’s emergence; and (3) Tang has gone so far as to make
                                    certain stipulations to his assuming office, namely (<hi
                                        rend="italic">a</hi>) pledging fall of Hankow to the
                                    Japanese, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) establishment of
                                    amalgamated new regime at Nanking, and (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >c</hi>) freedom to direct the new regime along the lines in the
                                    “Three People’s Principles” as laid down by Sun Yat Sen. The
                                    informant stated that stipulation (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) is
                                    based on the consideration that the National Government is not
                                    defeated so long as it retains Hankow; that meantime to further
                                    the purposes of puppet regimes would be traitorous; and that,
                                    after the expected fall of Hankow, Tang, as a leader of worth,
                                    respectability and prestige, can conscientiously take upon
                                    himself the burden of heading the regime which by the nature of
                                    things must be set up in the occupied areas. (The above outline
                                    has also been given to the Embassy by a retired official closely
                                    connected with members of the Peiping staff.)</item>

                                <item>The informant believes that the expected fall of Hankow will
                                    be a political turning point. He thinks that (1) the National
                                    Government will thereafter come more and more under the
                                    domination of the Communist leaders, and (2) the new regime or
                                    regimes cannot, with or without Tang, succeed because of the
                                    influence of the Communists with (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the
                                    irregulars who will never be wiped out, and (<hi rend="italic"
                                        >b</hi>) the young generation in China. He adheres to the
                                    opinion that Japanese aggression is in effect creating the
                                    communism which it ostensibly seeks to destroy. He points out
                                    that a kind of communism has already spread through the occupied
                                    areas in the form of guerrilla activities and banditry. He
                                    states that the young generation has come to look to communism
                                    or some offshoot thereof as the only means of saving China from
                                    the Japanese, that the coming into influence of the young
                                    generation will be coincident with the widespread growth of a
                                    communistic or quasi-communistic movement, which will be
                                    directed irrevocably to the freeing of China from the Japanese
                                    yoke and will ultimately be successful, and that meanwhile China
                                    must go through a period of growing chaos whose effect on <pb

                                estimate of the possible effect of the loss of Hankow upon the

                                opinions. The following estimate is based upon their study of the
                                situation.</p>
                            <p>From a military point of view Hankow forms the third corner of a
                                great triangle which to date has circumscribed the hostilities—as
                                Peiping, Shanghai, Hankow area. Until Hankow is taken the Japanese
                                forces are continually being stretched farther and farther from the
                                base of this triangle—the Peiping-Shanghai line and down its
                                hypotenuse from Peiping toward Chengchow. The strain on the Japanese
                                lines of communication has therefore been constantly increasing. The
                                merging of the two segments of the base with the capture of Hsuchow
                                was an alleviating factor but was largely vitiated when the Chinese
                                blocked the advance on Chengchow by breaching the Yellow River
                                dykes. By holding the Hankow–[Chengchow?] segment of the hypotenuse,
                                the Chinese have maintained contact with a vast area to the north
                                and northwest which has been a constant menace to the whole right
                                flank of the Japanese area, safeguarding their Sian–Lanchow route of
                                supply from Russia.</p>
                            <p>When Hankow falls into Japanese hands a considerable part of this
                                tension is bound to be relieved. The opening of the river will
                                greatly simplify the question of supply for the Japanese Army. Not
                                only will it be less susceptible to interruption by guerrilla
                                warfare, as in the case of the railroads, but by establishing their
                                advanced base at Hankow the Japanese will be able to support their
                                troops on the Peiping-Hankow hypotenuse from two directions, thereby
                                facilitating any operations to the westward.</p>
                            <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0235"/>
                            <p>It is not yet clear just how the Japanese intend to proceed in their
                                attack on Hankow, except that their original main effort from the
                                northeast now appears definitely to have been abandoned, and that an
                                advance up the river will figure largely in the present effort.
                                Presumably they will first attempt to take Nanchang, thus depriving
                                the Chinese of control of the largest air base in China and securing
                                it for themselves from which they can conduct aerial operations
                                against the whole of Central China. This will restore to them
                                complete air superiority for their advance on Hankow, the lack of
                                which seems to have handicapped them to some extent during their
                                recent river operations around [Kiukiang?], and will be an important
                                factor in the coming campaign.</p>
                            <p>In their advance upon Hankow the Japanese may adopt either of the
                                following moves, and the nature of the resultant situation is
                                largely dependent upon how they proceed. They may rely on (1) a
                                direct thrust up the river of combined military and naval operation,
                                or (2) they may elect to drive overland from Nanchang either to
                                Wuchang or straight to Changsha.</p>
                            <p>There has been some speculation in fact that they might coordinate
                                this second move with one from the north through southern Shansi and
                                down the Han River valley in a gigantic pincers movement. It seems
                                more likely at present however that their present operations in
                                western Honan and southern Shansi will keep them fully occupied in
                                those regions for some weeks to come and probably will eventually
                                lead them against the Sian–Lanchow area rather than down the Han
                                River valley. In fact, if they choose the latter, then a new and
                                separate force will have to deal with the former.</p>
                            <p>The Chinese actually occupy very strong positions in the areas they
                                are now holding and they will be further assisted during the next
                                few weeks by the summer floods. It remains to be seen however how
                                successful they will be in their defense, observers are now looking
                                for the blind spots, for experience has proved that the Chinese have
                                never been able to coordinate their defense. The efforts of the
                                majority have consistently been nullified by the negligence,
                                stupidity, failure to obey orders or failure to fight on the part of
                                a few.</p>
                            <p>If the Japanese take Hankow by a direct push up the river, they
                                obviously will still have to cope with the Nanchang–Shanghai–Wuchang
                                area as well as some very extensive mopping up operations to the
                                north of Hankow. Hunan is actually the strategic center of China,
                                and the Japanese can never really control it and the continuous
                                areas to the westward until they take Hengyang, a junction point
                                south of Changsha on the Canton–Hankow Railway where roads and
                                rivers connect with the west and southwest.</p>
                            <p>Three weeks ago it appeared that the Chinese High Command did not
                                intend to make a serious effort to hold Hankow. This attitude <pb
                                    n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0236"/>now seems to have changed
                                as present indications are that the Chinese intend to make the
                                taking of Hankow as expensive as possible. To this end large numbers
                                of troop[s] have recently been sent to the Nanchang area. Moreover,
                                Chiang Kai Shek has been making extensive preparations for a long
                                time to hold western Hunan. One of his most trusted lieutenants
                                Chang Chih Chung was installed there as Governor early this year and
                                25 divisions of fresh troops have been in training there under
                                younger officers who are themselves products of the Generalissimo’s
                                own schools and are intensely loyal to him. Reliable foreigners
                                state that a large majority of the war supplies which have come up
                                over the Canton Railway in recent months have been cached in western
                                Hunan.</p>
                            <p>The loss of Hankow will without doubt be a serious blow to the
                                Chinese strategically as well as politically and economically. The
                                strategic effect has already been indicated. Politically it will
                                separate the Government from access to the North where fighting and
                                defense measures are now in the hands of the former Communists and
                                the remains of the northern provincial troops. How serious this
                                effect will be only time can tell. It is not expected that it will
                                greatly affect the activities of the guerrillas in the northern
                                areas as the Government has never really been in very close touch
                                with them. And there has been no evidence yet of a tendency on the
                                part of the forces left in these areas to desert the cause. From a
                                political point of view the Government will be thrown into closer
                                contact with the southern areas where a tendency toward opposition
                                to the Government has for a long time been more than evident. The
                                consolidation of supplies in western Hunan mentioned above has been
                                in anticipation of this as well as of invasion by Japan of Hunan,
                                Kweichow, Kwangsi area, backed by Szechwan and Yunnan, promises to
                                continue perfectly active for a considerable time.<note n="16"
                                    xml:id="d219fn16">Sentence apparently garbled.</note> In some
                                respects the Government will be strengthened politically by the loss
                                of some of the provincial levies which will be left behind in the
                                north to fight as guerrillas. The mere existence of this strongly
                                nationalistic government center to the south will in itself make it
                                difficult for the Japanese military machine to stop at Hankow.</p>
                            <p>Economically the loss of Hankow will be a much more severe blow than
                                a military or political one. When the Government loses Hankow it
                                will lose all of the revenue that the trade of Hankow during recent
                                months has been able to give it. Such statistics as are available
                                indicate that exports from Hankow during the past few months have
                                    <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0237"/>averaged about Chinese
                                currency dollars 5 million per month. It is estimated that under the
                                present exchange control set up by the Government this trade has
                                given the Government control over about United States dollars
                                1,475,000 per month of foreign exchange which has been useful in its
                                foreign transactions. Most, if not all of this, will be lost to the
                                Government with the loss of Hankow and the interruption of traffic
                                on the Canton–Hankow Railway. In addition there will be the loss of
                                revenue from customs (Hankow receipt being estimated at Chinese
                                dollars 1,000,000 per month) salt taxes and consolidated taxes,
                                Hankow being a manufacturing center producing large quantities of
                                cigarettes. An indirect loss will result from the opening up of the
                                river and the revival of trade at Shanghai for the blocking of the
                                Yangtze has practically halted the trade of Shanghai. The loss of
                                Hankow means the loss of the last great Chinese industrial center
                                with its cotton mills and other factories and of the revenues which
                                this industry has brought to the Government. It has been said that
                                this will have its effect upon the financial stability of the
                                Chinese Government. However, there is reason to think that a
                                collapse of Chinese currency will have a far more serious effect in
                                the occupied areas and the economic position of Japan than upon the
                                Chinese, for in the areas under their control Chinese currency will
                                continue to serve the Government and the people as a medium of
                                exchange for domestic transactions.</p>
                            <p>It is our conclusion that serious as the loss of Hankow will be it
                                does not mean the collapse of Chinese resistance. We find it
                                difficult to believe that the taking of Hankow will enable the
                                Japanese to call a halt to Japanese military campaign in China or
                                even materially to reduce the number of Japanese troops that will be
                                necessary to garrison and hold the areas of occupation. The task of
                                eliminating the irregular guerrilla forces scattered all over and
                                around the area of occupation will constitute a major command and it
                                is believed that the Japanese military will find sufficient threat
                                left in the Chinese Government that remains to make them feel
                                impelled to continue the campaign westward—Hankow thus resulting in
                                another and more expensive Nanking rather than a final victory
                                marking the end of hostilities.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Dr. Hornbeck</hi>: Several days ago I had
                                luncheon, at his request, with Frederick Moore, who, as you know and
                                as he frankly admits, has been for a long period and is now employed
                                as adviser to the Japanese Government (Foreign Office, I think).</p>
                            <p>Mr. Moore talked at considerable length and with seeming frankness
                                about the situation in the Far East and in particular about the
                                problems and difficulties faced by the Japanese. Although many of
                                his observations add little to our knowledge and understanding of
                                the situation, the following statements, I believe, will interest

                                        Moore mentioned especially the circumstance, which he said
                                        he had on very good authority, that Japanese in Tokyo are
                                        praying at temples for the withdrawal of Japanese soldiers

                                        deteriorate when, as seems to be anticipated, aggressive
                                        warfare ends with the capture of Hankow and defensive

                                        vulnerability of the Japanese, the urgency and importance of

                            <p>I have been well but not intimately acquainted with Mr. Moore for
                                about ten years. I was impressed by the earnestness and, in view of
                                his position, critical frankness with which he spoke to me. Many of
                                his remarks tend to strengthen and illumine conclusions I had drawn
                                from-a conversation about two weeks ago with Dr. Takeuchi (Japanese
                                scholar and professor—author of the book entitled “War and Diplomacy
                                in the Japanese Empire”), who cautiously intimated that Japanese
                                civilians and soldiers were far from enthusiastic about the
                                hostilities in China and indicated a lack of sympathy with the
                                Japanese Army’s methods of attaining objectives. He stated that the
                                primary purpose of the Army in the present conflict was to oust
                                foreigners and foreign influence, particularly the much-feared
                                Soviet Russian (communist) influence, from China.</p>
                            <p>I feel, as I think you do, that the Japanese are now treading (and
                                realize that they are) very unsafe ground. I feel that very much now
                                depends upon the strength of the Chinese will and ability to
                                continue effective resistance. My conversation with Mr. Moore and
                                more recent conversations with Dr. Buck,<note n="19"
                                    xml:id="d220fn19">Professor John Lossing Buck, of Nanking
                                    University, special agent for the Treasury Department in
                                    China.</note> Treasury official lately returned from China,
                                confirm these views. The position of the Chinese, should Hankow
                                fall, would undoubtedly be critical and the matter of continued
                                effective resistance would be in the balance. It appears easy to
                                fall into the errors of placing too much faith in the ability of the
                                Chinese, unassisted, to carry on the fight and of placing too much
                                confidence in predictions that the Japanese will be unable to
                                consolidate their gains.</p>

                            <p>I believe, as I think you do, that it is vitally important not only
                                for China but for us and for other democratic nations that Chinese
                                resistance not collapse. Believing as I do, I cannot but earnestly
                                recommend that, within the limitations of our desire to avoid
                                involvement (but within reasonable limitations which take into
                                account the fact that the element of chance cannot be completely
                                eliminated from any policy worthy of the name), we should overlook
                                no opportunity now to bolster up Chinese will and ability to resist,
                                and to embarrass the Japanese in their attempts to conquer China. To
                                those ends I believe (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) that the doctrine of
                                non-recognition should be unequivocally restated to apply in the
                                present situation, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) that as a corollary to
                                non-recognition steps should be taken effectively to discourage
                                loans or material credits to Japan or to Chinese regimes or agencies
                                under Japanese control, (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) that the
                                possibility of affording financial assistance to China should be
                                thoroughly explored, (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) that our trade with
                                Japan should be carefully examined with a view to withholding,
                                either through export or import restrictions or both, assistance to
                                Japan, and (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) that consultation and
                                collaboration, if possible, with other interested governments in
                                regard to the implementation of feasible measures should be
                                    undertaken.<note n="20" xml:id="d220fn20">See also <ref

                            <p>I realize that some of these matters can only appropriately be dealt
                                with legislatively rather than administratively, but in so far as
                                action may be taken administratively I feel that it should be taken,
                                and where legislative action is required I think that the influence
                                of the Department should be brought to bear.</p>
                            <p>During recent months I have followed editorial comment throughout the
                                country closely, and I have also discussed the Far Eastern problems
                                with many people not especially interested in those problems. I am
                                willing to hazard the estimate that although a very large proportion
                                of the people in this country continue to desire (1) that we avoid
                                involvement in the conflict in the Far East, a very substantial and
                                influential body of public opinion desires also (2) that American
                                rights and interests in China be protected and preserved in so far
                                as possible, (3) that the integrity and sovereignty of China be
                                preserved, and (4) that for the ultimate good of all, Japanese
                                militarism be defeated. Examining these estimated desiderata, one is
                                tempted to observe, in the light of experience, that American rights
                                and interests may not be preserved<note n="*" xml:id="d220fn22">The
                                    evidence of the past year indicates clearly that those rights
                                    and interests are not being respected by the Japanese, and that
                                    in the absence of intention to take retaliatory or coercive
                                    measures diplomatic action is of little avail. [Footnote in the
                                    original.]</note> unless China’s sovereignty is preserved, that
                                China’s sovereignty may not be preserved unless Japanese militarism
                                is defeated, and that from the long viewpoint our involvement <pb
                                    n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0241"/>in the Far East may not be
                                avoided unless Japanese militarism is defeated.</p>
                            <p>I am not one to hold up the bugaboo of Japanese attack upon the
                                United States, but I do believe that the chance we take now of
                                involvement by rendering assistance to China is slight in comparison
                                with the chance we take in watching Japanese militarism succeed in
                                China. Predictions that Japan will be fully occupied in China for
                                many years to come if she succeeds in her present military campaign
                                are not borne out by experience. The same comforting predictions
                                were made when Japan took Manchuria and I believe that just such a
                                mistaken thought was back of British and European policy at that
                                time. I was in Manchuria in 1931–32<note n="21" xml:id="d220fn21">As
                                    Consul at Mukden.</note> and I do not recall that any one in a
                                position to know, including Japanese civilian officials, actually
                                thought that Japanese military aggression would stop in Manchuria,
                                and it is not believed that Japanese aggression, if successful in
                                China, will stop there. It cannot be too frequently repeated that
                                the Japanese military is psychologically an aggressive force which
                                should not be expected to become satiated on successful aggression
                                or deterred from aggression by normal economic and political
                                considerations.</p>
                            <p>I believe that, although Japanese control of China would probably
                                result in new and increased difficulties and friction between the
                                United States and Japan, it need not be assumed that such a
                                situation would of itself lead to an open breach between the two
                                countries. In this connection it is well to be mindful, of course,
                                that for many years to come the Philippine Commonwealth may
                                constitute a delicate problem in our relations with Japan.
                                Furthermore, I hope that, should Japanese aggression subsequently be
                                directed against British, Dutch, or French possessions in the Far
                                East, or against the Soviet Union, we would be able to avoid
                                involvement. However, I restate that in my opinion the chances of
                                our involvement, were Japanese aggression in China to prove
                                successful, would be measurably greater than would be the chances of
                                our becoming involved in the present conflict were we now to render
                                reasonable assistance to China.</p>
                            <p>I believe that we have a very great and urgent obligation of
                                responsibility, nationally and internationally, to ourselves and to
                                posterity, to do what we can within reason and without assuming
                                undue risk of involvement toward influencing the course of the
                                present conflict along lines favorable to the Chinese—toward
                                endeavoring to forestall an outcome of the conflict that would do
                                violence to principles which we earnestly desire to have prevail—,
                                and that now is the psychological moment for us to take practicable
                                steps toward discharging that obligation.</p>

                                asked me to express to you the hope that at a favorable moment, and
                                before Japan should recognize any puppet regime at Nanking or
                                Peiping (thus as he said closing the back door to negotiations, the
                                front door having been closed by the statement of the Japanese
                                Government last January that they would refuse to recognize or treat
                                with what they termed the Chiang Kai Shek government), the
                                Government of the United States, taking parallel action with Great
                                Britain (and possibly France), would extend to both Japan and to
                                China an offer of good offices to bring both sides together to bring
                                to an end the present hostilities without, of course, mentioning
                                that such an offer was made at the suggestion of the Chinese. He
                                expressed the further hope that if stich an offer of good offices
                                should fail of its purpose and Japan should proceed to set up and
                                recognize a new regime in Nanking or elsewhere the United States

                            <p>This move should not in my opinion be interpreted as indicating a

                                agreement with the Japanese. Chinese appear to believe that Japan is
                                approaching a point where they might be expected to withdraw from

                                contended by the Japanese) as indicating weakening of Japanese
                                spirit.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that the Chinese Government
                                intended to make every effort to defend Hankow, making its capture
                                expensive as possible to the Japanese. He stated that Japanese
                                people were well aware that the Japanese were tired of the war, that
                                they were beginning to realize that they could not make a conquest
                                of China, that the present campaign for Hankow would either result
                                in its capture at great expense to the Japanese or a deadlock and
                                that therefore a moment might present itself when an offer of <pb
                                    n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0243"/>good offices by the United
                                States and Great Britain would be listened to by the Japanese.
                                China, he pointed out, could not sue for peace and Japan would not,
                                but an offer from a friendly and disinterested outsider might make
                                it possible for the Japanese to climb down from a difficult
                                position.</p>
                            <p>The Department has already received my estimate of the situation here
                                in my 362 of July 19, 3 p.m. I feel certain that the Chinese
                                Government will not collapse and sue for peace when Hankow falls.
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs confirms this view. I am of course not
                                in any position to say whether the time might or may have come when
                                an offer of good offices to Japan by the United States and Great
                                Britain would be useful. I shall repeat this message to Tokyo in
                                order that Grew may have an opportunity to comment upon this phase
                                of the matter.</p>
                            <p>Foreign Minister expects that if we refuse to recognize position
                                established by the Japanese by force in contravention of Kellogg
                                Pact and Nine Power Treaty and made reservation of our position and
                                rights under existing treaties between us and China we would be in a
                                position to assert those rights if and when by conference these
                                present hostilities may be brought to a close.</p>
                            <p>British Ambassador informs me that Minister for Foreign Affairs made
                                a proposal similar in all respects to the above (which I have made
                                known to him) and that he is transmitting it to his Government upon
                                his arrival in Hong Kong about August 3.</p>

                            <p>494. Following is a general digest of a long conversation with the
                                British Ambassador yesterday.</p>

                                <item>The Ambassador, on returning from the mountains for 2 days in
                                    Tokyo, said that he wished to tell me of his plan for a talk
                                    with the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday afternoon. The
                                    British Government feels that the time has come when it must
                                    examine its future policy toward Japan in connection with the
                                    situation in China. It must ascertain whether any confidence can
                                    be placed in Japanese assurances of the intention and desire to
                                    respect British interests without discrimination in China or
                                    whether the Japanese propose progressively to crowd British
                                    interests out of China. Great Britain must reach a <pb n="240"
                                        xml:id="pg_240" facs="0244"/>decision as to whether she can
                                    in future cooperate with Japan or whether she must throw her
                                    full weight behind the Chinese Central Government. Sir Robert
                                    Craigie therefore proposed to present to General Ugaki a list of
                                    some of the principal British desiderata and to discuss the
                                    situation along general lines.</item>

                                <item>The Ambassador said that he proposed to tell the Foreign
                                    Minister that Japan was going to face great difficulties in the
                                    process of consolidation and reconstruction in China even after
                                    complete military victory and that at that time Japan would
                                    stand greatly in need of foreign financial cooperation.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>There then arises the question of sanctions in case the
                                    British representations lead to no favorable results. Craigie
                                    asked me if I had been informed of a recent approach to our
                                    Government by the British Government to ascertain whether we
                                    would consider some kind of financial support of the Chinese
                                    Central Government in the form of loans or credits. I replied
                                    that I had not been informed thereof. The Ambassador said that
                                    an unfavorable reply to the British inquiry had been given by
                                    the American Government on the ground that such a sanction as
                                    the British Government proposed would not accord with American
                                    policy and that there were other methods which the American
                                    Government would prefer to follow. Craigie asked me if I knew
                                    what methods my Government had in mind to which I replied in the
                                    negative.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Craigie realized that the position of our Government with
                                    respect to foreign financing was somewhat different from that of
                                    the British Government but he felt strongly that if it could
                                    become known in Japan that unless the Japanese respect our
                                    respective interests in China Japan could hope for no financial
                                    support either from American or British sources during the
                                    period of reconstruction the effect would be important and
                                    salutary. (In this connection I have constantly in mind

                                <item>Craigie informs me today that his interview with the Foreign

                                    me and that nothing particularly new emerged. Sir Robert
                                    nevertheless received the impression that in spite of the
                                    difficulties and especially the opposition of the Japanese
                                    authorities in China, genuine efforts are being made in Tokyo to
                                    comply with British requirements.</item>

                            <p>377. My 376, July 27, 2 p.m. At lunch today at which I was only guest
                                Generalissimo inquired what I thought of suggestion which Wang Chung
                                Hui had made. I told him that while I was sure that American
                                Government would be willing at an appropriate time to offer its good
                                offices to bring hostilities to an end I felt that it was an open
                                question as to when such an appropriate time might arrive.
                                Generalissimo stated that he felt that should Japan take Hankow a
                                reiteration of America’s often stated policy of refusing to
                                recognize a regime set up by force and in contravention of treaty
                                would have a beneficial effect <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242"

                                that America had maintained its Embassy at seat of Government
                                throughout present hostilities.</p>

                                    account<note n="31" xml:id="d227fn31">Not printed.</note> of the
                                activities of the Japanese Army on entering Hsuchow in May of this
                                year, from which it will be noted that the orgy of looting, raping,
                                drinking and murder which marked the entry of the Japanese forces
                                into Nanking was duplicated at Hsuchow. It seems reasonable to
                                assume, therefore, that, whatever may be the cause, such tendencies
                                are characteristic in the Japanese Army, and become credible to
                                foreigners only when there are foreigners present on the scene.</p>

                                and it is therefore necessary for his safety that the source be very

                                Nanchang, Kiangsi, of a number of suspected gas cases occurring
                                among Chinese troops who participated in the hostilities at Ma Tang
                                on the Yangtze River between Anking and Kiukiang. Captain Dorn and
                                an American missionary accompanied Dr. Talbot on his tour of
                                investigation.</p>
                            <p>The Embassy is of the opinion that Dr. Talbot’s report of his

                                    Talbot concluded that the cases “were all caused by gas
                                    poisoning, of the Mustard Gas type.” Capt. Dorn suggested that
                                    some of the cases might have been caused by Chlorine Gas.</note>
                                can be accepted without question. Dr. Talbot’s report, as quoted in

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have made a rather hasty
                                survey of the considerations of a commercial nature which would be
                                involved in reaching a decision as to the desirability of
                                terminating our treaty of commerce and navigation with Japan<note

                                offer the following comments as my preliminary reaction.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hornbeck’s memorandum<note n="36" xml:id="d229fn36">Not found in
                                    Department files.</note> refers to various violations by Japan
                                of our rights under the treaty. So far as I am aware, there are no
                                cases outstanding of violations of the commercial clauses of the
                                treaty. In the course of a study recently undertaken of the
                                possibility of suspending the generalization of trade-agreement
                                concessions to Japan because of Japanese activities in China, it was
                                concluded that <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0249"/>there was no
                                clear evidence of discrimination against American trade in Japan.
                                There is a possibility that the Japanese Government may be
                                influencing Japanese spinners to divert purchases of cotton to
                                sources other than the United States, but no evidence which would
                                support this suspicion has been unearthed.</p>
                            <p>In connection with the study of suspending Japan to which I have
                                referred, consideration was given to the possible effects of
                                retaliatory action by Japan against our trade. In view of the fact
                                that Japan has reduced its imports from this and other countries to
                                the barest essentials, the conclusion was reached that retaliatory
                                action by Japan would not have a significant effect upon our trade
                                with her at the present time.</p>
                            <p>These conclusions tend to suggest that termination of the treaty
                                would have little effect upon the present trade situation.
                                Furthermore, it is open to question whether Japan would have
                                anything to gain in the immediate future by pursuing an openly
                                discriminatory trade policy in so far as the United States is
                                concerned.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, termination of the treaty, unless it were replaced
                                by a new one, would remove one important barrier to the adoption of
                                a more openly bilateralistic policy by Japan and would wipe out
                                whatever protection the treaty offers for future trade development.
                                Both of these possibilities would appear to warrant further
                                consideration.</p>
                            <p>The foregoing comments relate solely to the commercial clauses of the
                                treaty. I assume that consideration will be given in other divisions
                                to the value to us of the provisions dealing with navigation,
                                residence and related matters.</p>
                            <p>I should like to venture one further suggestion in the event that it
                                is decided to terminate the treaty. It is that notice of termination
                                not be given on the ground that Japan has violated the treaty. Japan
                                has in many instances been excluded from the benefit of
                                trade-agreement concessions on products in which she is interested
                                by the establishment of subclassifications and value brackets.
                                However justifiable this policy may be, Japan would doubtless charge
                                that we have violated at least the spirit of the treaty
                                ourselves.</p>
                            <p>The particular case which is dealt with in the attached file<note
                                    n="37" xml:id="d229fn37">Identity not recorded.</note> involves
                                a matter of disputed interpretation. An open charge that Japan has
                                violated the treaty might cause the Japanese to claim that tariff
                                specialization in our agreements has been carried to such an extent
                                as to represent a wholesale evasion of our obligations. While we
                                could defend our action in these instances to our own satisfaction
                                the questions involved are highly technical ones and some doubt as
                                to whether we are not ourselves guilty of evading the treaty might
                                remain in the public mind if there were a controversy on the
                                subject.</p>
                            <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0250"/>
                            <p>If an alternative reason for termination is desired, and if we would
                                be prepared to enter into new negotiations with Japan, we might give
                                as a reason for termination our desire to have the treaty revised in
                                the light of modern conditions and requirements, citing the action
                                we have already taken in the case of our treaty with Italy.<note

                                would apparently conflict with the two treaties. A proposal could be
                                made to Japan that the provisions of the 1911 treaty be brought
                                up-to-date. If negotiations for a new treaty were undertaken, it is
                                to be assumed that this Government would insist upon the inclusion

                            <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0251"/>
                            <p>This editorial is believed to be the outgrowth of an acrimonious
                                dispute during the last session of the People’s Political Council,
                                which convocation met from July 5 to July 15, 1938.</p>
                            <p>The dispute arose when one of the delegates, Mr. Li Shen-wu, an
                                editor of the <hi rend="italic">Commercial Press</hi> and a member
                                of the clique led by Mr. Wang Ching-wei, General Chang Chun, and
                                General Ho Ying-ch’in, recommended that China take steps to come to
                                an understanding with Germany and Italy. Wang Ming, formerly Chinese
                                member of the Communist International, hotly replied that Germany
                                and Italy were allies of Japan and that any <hi rend="italic"
                                    >rapprochement</hi> with them would lead to capitulation to the
                                Japanese. The Soviet Union, Wang Ming declared, is the natural ally
                                of China.</p>
                            <p>Li Shen-wu and those delegates of similar persuasion thereupon
                                demanded of Wang Ming, “Are you a Chinese or a Russian?” A scuffle
                                was avoided only by the intercession of more temperate elements and
                                the appeal of the Chairman, Dr. Chang Po-ling, to remember the
                                United Front.</p>
                            <p>The enclosed editorial carries Wang Ming’s, and of course the Chinese
                                Communist Party’s, foreign policy platform to the public. The
                                program is the alignment of China with the democracies and the
                                Soviet Union and opposition to Japan, Germany and Italy, who are
                                classified as “aggressors”.</p>
                            <p>The alliance of Germany and Italy with Japan is motivated, the
                                Communists contend, by (1) a desire to make use of Japanese aid in
                                prosecuting military adventures in Europe, (2) on Germany’s part, a
                                wish to secure through joint action with Japan colonies in the South
                                Pacific, (3) the need for assistance from the east in a combined
                                attack on the Soviet Union, and (4) a hope that out of the Japanese
                                invasion of China they may secure a share of the benefit. Because of
                                the close understanding and association which Germany and Italy have
                                with Japan, the Chinese communists consider those two European
                                states as enemies of China. Therefore, any proposal of a <hi
                                    rend="italic">rapprochement</hi> with Germany and Italy is
                                viewed as a betrayal of China, through Germany and Italy, to
                                Japan.</p>
                            <p>The ability of the democratic powers to take common action is
                                conceded by the editorial to be weaker than that of the aggressor
                                bloc. An advance, however, is professed to be noticeable, in joint
                                restraint of aggression on the part of the democracies.</p>
                            <p>It is in the Soviet Union that the Chinese Communist Party places its
                                greatest reliance for assistance to China’s cause. Only through
                                alliance with the Soviet Union and through its assistance, the
                                editorial maintains, can China maintain its place in international
                                affairs and continue the struggle in the war of resistance.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                            <p>I have received the following communication from the Refugee Zone
                                Committee with the request that it be transmitted to the Japanese
                                authorities: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“A Committee composed of American, British, French, German,
                                        and Italian nationals has been working for some time on a
                                        plan for refugee zones in Hankow and Wuchang respectively.
                                        The proposed refugee zones would comprise (<hi rend="italic"
                                            >a</hi>) at Hankow the area bounded on the east by the
                                        Yangtze River, on the west by the Peiping–Hankow Railway, on
                                        the south by the Kianghan Road and on the north by the
                                        Japanese concession and a line extending westward from it to
                                        but not including the Peiping–Hankow Railway. The French
                                        Concession and special administrative district number 3
                                        being excluded from the proposed zone, so far as
                                        administration is concerned, although geographically they
                                        are within the area. (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) At Wuchang
                                        the area included between the old Tsao Hu Men and the small
                                        East Gate, following the line of the City Wall; the west
                                        boundary to be Tsao Hu Men Kai, Fu Kai and Huen Kai to San
                                        Tao Kai; the south boundary to be San Tao Kai, the rear of
                                        the old Fu Tai Yamen and then extending out to Ya Li Chu
                                        Kai. Maps of Hankow and Wuchang showing the proposed refugee
                                        zones will be forwarded for transmission to the Japanese
                                        authorities.</p>
                                    <p>The proposed zones consist largely and indeed predominately
                                        of foreign owned property, the inviolability of which is
                                        admitted and it is hoped that this will facilitate the
                                        present efforts. It is realized that the approval of refugee
                                        zones must be dependent upon their complete
                                        demilitarization. The Committee have received provisional
                                        assurances from the Chinese side that their approval would
                                        be accompanied by compliance with this basic condition and
                                        the Committee would naturally only put their scheme into
                                        operation if and when this compliance has been made
                                        effective.</p>
                                    <p>Steps would be taken effectually to isolate the refugee zones
                                        from adjoining non-demilitarized areas, and it is likely
                                        that the administrative bodies thereof would consist of this
                                        Committee or its nominees.</p>
                                    <p>The Committee understands a refugee zone to be an area which
                                        having been previously demilitarized shall prior to the
                                        occupation of the city be immune from bombing or shelling or
                                        any other form of attack; which during an entry into or
                                        assault on the city shall remain outside the scope of
                                        military operations; and which, after occupation of the
                                        city, may be entered and subsequently controlled solely by
                                        military police acting under regular authority.</p>
                                    <p>The maintenance of an adequate police force being essential
                                        for the proper administration of the zones, the immunity of
                                        its members in common with that of the Chinese populace in
                                        the zones in general must be assured.</p>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Oahu</hi> reports that a Japanese hospital
                                ship which went up river towards Kiukiang a short time ago was
                                filled with troops when it passed Nanking. It is not likely that all
                                these were wounded men as there would be no point in sending a
                                shipload of casualties towards the front.</p>
                            <p>In this connection it has been noted that during the past few days a
                                large number of Japanese hospital corps units have been coming into
                                Nanking. Members of the Embassy staff, as well as other foreigners
                                who have seen these units, all testify that while each man wears a
                                Red Cross brassard on his arm, approximately 50% of the men are
                                armed with rifles, and the officers and noncommissioned officers
                                wear pistols.</p>

                                <item>With regard to the question presented by Johnson whether “the
                                    time might or may have come when an offer of good offices to
                                    Japan by the United States and Great Britain would be useful”, I
                                    am assuming that it continues to be the position of our
                                    Government that if the tender of good offices were made by the
                                    United States to Japan and China, it would be clearly indicated
                                    that terms of settlement could not be recommended to China by us
                                    which would be inconsistent with the Nine Power Treaty

                                    who would be bound to sense a war weariness, however sedulously
                                    and effectively overt manifestations thereof were suppressed, it
                                    is surprising that there should prevail belief in despatch of
                                    responsible quarter abroad that there is “weakening of Japanese
                                    spirit”. Indeed there persists especially among the urban
                                    population a noticeable attitude toward the conflict of levity
                                    and mock seriousness which the official movement for “spiritual
                                    mobilization” has not eradicated. With reference to the
                                    indications of such weakening cited in the second paragraph of
                                    Johnson’s telegram, the events of the last few days on the

                                    previous negative Japanese attitude on the Changkufeng incident
                                    as evidence of Japanese weakening; of others [I?] dare say that
                                    if all the facts of the Hainan issue were known a substantially
                                    different conclusion from that apparently reached by the Chinese
                                    might reasonably be drawn. Possibly the various Japanese
                                    restrictions on commerce and on the non-military uses of
                                    essential war materials have stimulated (and perhaps not
                                    unnaturally) the belief abroad that there is growing discontent
                                    with the protracted hostilities. I refer the Department to our

                                    the “Nationalist Government of China” has been reaffirmed on
                                    every conceivable opportunity by responsible Japanese. At the
                                    same time it is privately admitted that any settlement with any
                                    Chinese personage other than Chiang Kai Shek would not be worth
                                    the paper it was written on and there is cherished a lingering
                                    hope that eventually Chiang might disassociate himself from
                                    uncompromising anti-Japanese elements and come to a settlement
                                    with Japan. But that there is at present disposition on the part
                                    of Japan to entering into a settlement with the Chinese
                                    Government as now constituted, I cannot bring myself to believe.
                                    Certainly there is no manifestation of any such
                                    disposition.</item>

                                <item>There is finally the fundamental and irrevocable conflict
                                    between Japan’s objectives in China and the determination of
                                    China that a negotiated peace shall be consistent with the Nine
                                    Power Treaty. Even before the fall of Nanking it seemed to us
                                    highly doubtful if an offer of American good office bridged the
                                    gap between Japan and China and led to a settlement consistent
                                    with the letter if not the spirit of that treaty. If any
                                    Japanese thought with regard to the conflict has subsequently
                                    been crystallizing and promise[s] soon to become dominant, it is
                                    that the eventual settlement, if and when made, shall bring to
                                    Japan material advantages commensurate with the cost of the
                                    hostilities. Far from any thought of withdrawing from China, the
                                    human and material resources of the nation are being mobilized
                                    against the time when the unfolding of the military campaign
                                    will enable Japan to maintain a permanent domicile in China. In
                                    the light of Johnson’s estimates of China’s position an offer at
                                    the present time of American good offices would in our opinion
                                    immediately betray any Chinese expectation that terms of peace
                                    acceptable to Japan would also be acceptable to China. We
                                    believe that such an offer if made today would (<hi

                            <p>After the Chinese Ambassador<note n="49" xml:id="d234fn49">C. T.
                                    Wang.</note> had spoken to me on another subject, during his
                                call, he referred to the recent <hi rend="italic">démarche</hi>
                                handed to Ambassador Johnson by the Chinese Foreign Office,
                                suggesting the idea of mediation by this government between China
                                and Japan. He stated that his government had called this to his
                                attention and he was wondering what we might have in mind in that
                                connection. I replied that I would be glad to propound a question to
                                the Ambassador, and that question was—what, in the Ambassador’s
                                judgment, would be best for China? Would it be desirable on China’s
                                part for an approach to be made to Japan for mediation without the
                                slightest knowledge as to what Japan’s future plans relative to
                                occupation and otherwise remaining in China would be in the event of
                                mediation? The Ambassador said that if he might express his personal
                                opinion he would readily say that this preliminary question as to
                                Japan’s future intentions in China would be absolutely necessary. I
                                replied that of course this Government has made many offers of
                                mediation to both governments and that we have said repeatedly to
                                the Japanese officials that we stand ready to exercise our good
                                offices in this respect whenever it may be desirable on the part of
                                the governments of China and Japan. The Ambassador said that his
                                government might desire us to feel out the situation in respect to
                                mediation at Tokyo. I repeated what I had just said, and added that,
                                naturally, Japan knows when she might be willing to accept mediation
                                and she knows of our standing offer, and that she will undoubtedly
                                determine what her future policy will be with reference to the
                                occupation of China, its extent and nature, before she will be ready
                                to agree to mediation. Finally, I said, “You can say to your
                                government, if you desire, what your individual views are with
                                respect to the preliminary question I propounded at the outset, and
                                then you can add that this Government has been keeping in mind all
                                phases of the mediation question since the outbreak of hostilities
                                and that it continues to do so, but that this does not necessarily
                                mean that there are in immediate prospect any new developments.” I
                                commented that the Ambassador could himself judge as well as we
                                could as to this latter possibility and when same might occur.</p>

                                Sino-Japanese hostilities has been modified by the recent Manchurian

                                because a major conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union
                                promises, with a shift of the main theater of Japanese operations to
                                the northeast, the possibility of a relaxation in fighting Japanese,
                                the uncompromising and exacting character of which warfare is most
                                uncongenial to the temperament of the average high Chinese

                            <p>A Russo-Japanese war at the present time would however tend to split
                                the Chinese united front, a large portion of the Kuomintang being
                                more anti-Russian than anti-Japanese. The Communists and Leftist
                                member of the Kuomintang therefore view the split in the northeast
                                with mixed feelings, fearing a recrudescence of domestic dissension.

                                stated that the end of June the Italian Ambassador had sent a
                                Secretary to see the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs with a
                                message to the effect that the Italian Ambassador had the best
                                reasons to believe that the Japanese wanted peace at once and were
                                ready to offer terms much more favorable to China than those
                                communicated through the German Ambassador in the spring [<hi
                                    rend="italic">winter</hi>]. It was proposed that the Chinese
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs write to the Japanese Prime Minister to
                                the effect that henceforward “the policy of the Chinese Government
                                will not be anti-Japanese.” The Italian Secretary said that the
                                Japanese attached importance to the sending of a letter from the
                                Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs rather than Chiang Kai-shek
                                with whom their repeated declarations made it difficult for them to
                                deal.</p>
                            <p>According to this account the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                told the Italian Secretary in reply that the proposal could not be
                                considered in its present form excluding, as it did, Chiang
                                Kai-shek. He said, however, the Chinese were equally anxious for
                                peace and would accept mediation. The Chinese Foreign Minister also
                                informed the Italian Secretary that China did not want to do
                                anything without the approval of the British Government.</p>

                            <p>Ronald added that since the above nothing had occurred. Asked whether
                                the British Ambassador made any comment to General Chiang Kai-shek,
                                Ronald replied that he had not.</p>

                            <p>748. The Foreign Office informed me this afternoon that the British
                                Ambassador in China on a recent visit to Hankow was approached by
                                the Chinese Government with a request for the good offices of the
                                British Government between themselves and Japan. According to the
                                British Ambassador, a similar approach was made by the Chinese
                                Government at the same time to Ambassador Johnson. Last night
                                instructions in the following tenor were telegraphed to Ambassador
                                Craigie at Tokyo:</p>
                            <p>After consultation with Ambassador Grew and in his discretion with
                                the German Ambassador,<note n="53" xml:id="d238fn53">Gen. Eugen
                                    Ott.</note> and subject to concurrence of the British Ambassador
                                in China who has been informed of the instructions to Tokyo,
                                Ambassador Craigie is to approach the Japanese Foreign Minister and
                                tell him that the British Government is prepared, either alone or
                                acting with other neutral powers, to offer its good offices with a
                                view to settlement of the Sino-Japanese difficulty. Ambassador
                                Craigie is being requested to avoid the use of the word “mediation”
                                and to confine the British offer strictly to “good offices”. The
                                Foreign Office explains that they are not willing to be anything
                                more than a “post office” in the matter and that if their offer of
                                good offices is accepted they do not propose to comment upon or
                                discuss the merits of any proposals which may be made by either side
                                to the other except to the party making the proposals, in the event
                                that British comment or criticism is requested. In other words, they
                                will not comment to the Chinese upon Japanese proposals nor to the
                                Japanese upon Chinese proposals. Ambassador Craigie at the same time
                                is to invite the attention of the Japanese Foreign Minister to the
                                statement made in the House of Commons on July 26, as follows: “In
                                the Far East we should be very glad to offer our services to bring
                                about the cessation of hostilities if ever and whenever we can see
                                an opportunity <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0260"/>which
                                presents a favorable prospect of success” (see Embassy’s despatch
                                No. 862, July 28, 1938,<note n="54" xml:id="d238fn54">Not
                                    printed.</note> enclosure, Hansard, top of column 2972). This
                                statement of the Prime Minister’s<note n="55" xml:id="d238fn55"
                                    >Neville Chamberlain.</note> incidentally anticipated the
                                Chinese request by 2 or 3 days.</p>
                            <p>Following the overture made by the Chinese Government to the British
                                Ambassador, it was confirmed in London by the Chinese Ambassador
                                acting under instructions and the Foreign Office has been informed
                                that a similar procedure was carried out with the United States
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>In explanation of the instruction to Ambassador Craigie authorizing
                                him in his discretion to consult also with the German Ambassador,
                                the Foreign Office explained that Ambassador Henderson in Berlin has
                                repeatedly urged the advisability of associating Germany, if at all
                                possible, in any steps which might be taken toward a settlement of
                                the Far Eastern conflict. He urges this on the ground that it could
                                only be interpreted as a gesture of friendliness toward Germany on
                                the part of Great Britain and because in fact, if the German
                                Government wished to do so, it could be of genuine help in bringing
                                about a pacific settlement of the Sino-Japanese dispute. With this
                                opinion the Foreign Office agrees.</p>

                            <p>756. My 748, August 11, 7 p.m. The Foreign Office informs me that an
                                acknowledgment has been received from Ambassador Craigie who intends
                                to discuss the matter with Mr. Grew on Monday. The Ambassador says
                                that he considers secrecy to be of the utmost importance if there is
                                to be any chance of success in this endeavor and suggests that he
                                consult with his French colleague as well as with the German
                                Ambassador. To this the Foreign Office will make no objection.
                                Accordingly the French Government will be informed in confidence of
                                the Chinese proposal to the British and of the instructions to
                                Ambassador Craigie.</p>

                                ready to exercise our good offices; and the Japanese Government is
                                aware of our standing offer. In the absence of an indication by
                                Japan of a readiness to accept an offer of good offices and without
                                previous knowledge concerning Japan’s intentions and desires with
                                especial reference to the extent to which Japan might wish to remain
                                in China, we would be reluctant to associate ourselves in a
                                procedure wherein we would function as a “post office”, because the
                                powers so functioning would probably not only be called upon to
                                transmit terms inconsistent with the provisions of treaties to which
                                we are committed and with principles in which we believe, but
                                because of the implication that the powers acting in such capacity
                                were pressing such terms. In view of these considerations we do not
                                desire that you make an approach to the Japanese Government similar
                                to that which Craigie has been authorized to make. You may discuss
                                the matter fully with Craigie and inform him that we are of the
                                opinion that an offer of good offices at the present time would have
                                no chance of success and that in the light of considerations set
                                forth hereinbefore we are not prepared to make a <hi rend="italic"

                            <p>1102. 1. At 6:15 this morning, passengers in a motor car, bearing a
                                Shanghai defense force license created a disturbance in Robinson
                                Road (American defense sector). A marine sergeant approached the car
                                which had three Japanese in plain clothes in the back seat, all
                                armed with pistols, and one Chinese chauffeur in the front seat. On
                                the approach of the marine, the Chinese chauffeur started the car.
                                The marine jumped on the running board and one of the Japanese in
                                the rear of the car pointed his pistol at the marine’s neck. The
                                marine then drew his own pistol and ordered the chauffeur to halt.
                                At this point another marine, armed with a Thomson submachine gun,
                                approached and the Japanese dropped their pistols. At this point
                                Colonel Price<note n="59" xml:id="d241fn59">Col. Charles F. B.
                                    Price, commanding officer of the United States Fourth
                                    Marines.</note> arrived and took charge. Marine authorities
                                escorted the three Japanese to the Pootoo Road police station. They
                                refused to give their names or to get out of car when asked. They
                                were thereupon forcibly removed from the car, searched and disarmed
                                against resistance, one of them receiving a slight cut on the back
                                of the head. They had no license for carrying arms in the
                                Settlement, nor any paper permitting them to use a Shanghai defense
                                force license or showing that they had any connection with the
                                Japanese Armed Forces. They denied any such connection. In these
                                circumstances, the Marine authorities turned them over to the police
                                as armed thugs caught creating a disturbance in the American
                                sector.</p>
                            <p>2. Japanese consular police arrived, and after examination by them,
                                the accused admitted connection with the Japanese Army, whereupon
                                the consular police refused to take custody of them. They are still
                                in the hands of the Marines.</p>
                            <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0263"/>
                            <p>3. Marine authorities have requested Japanese Army authorities to
                                send an officer to identify the accused. If they can identify them,
                                they will be handed over against a receipt from the Japanese
                                military authorities. If they cannot, Marine authorities propose
                                handing them to the custody of Settlement police.</p>
                            <p>4. The above information was obtained from Marine Headquarters.</p>

                                    implicated, if not the actual instigators, and the most
                                    significant fact was that those involved were members of the
                                    Special Service Section of the Japanese Army. With the active
                                    assistance of the agents of the Ta Tao Government, they were
                                    bent on creating disturbances and it was only because of the
                                    vigilance and courage of the marines in the American defense
                                    sector that serious trouble was averted in that area. Vigilance

                                    Japanese and the Ta Tao Government were greatly annoyed at the
                                    widespread display of Chinese national flags in the area south

                                    create ill feeling and trouble. The Japanese, however, according
                                    to press reports have denied any connection with this affair,
                                    claiming that the plane was a Japanese commercial one leased to
                                    the Ta Tao Government for the purpose of distributing pamphlets

                                    Ambassador in Japan, <ref target="#pg_257">p. 257</ref>.</note>
                                was communicated orally and informally to the Foreign Office today.
                                A copy of the instructions to Ambassador Craigie outlined in my 748,
                                August 11, 7 p.m., was telegraphed to the British Ambassador in
                                China who has now replied that these instructions go beyond the
                                Chinese request, the essence of which he says was the suggestion for
                                a simultaneous parallel approach to the Japanese by the United
                                States, British and possibly French Governments. I understand that
                                Ambassador Kerr is doubtful of the advisability of the British
                                approaching the Japanese alone and has informed the Foreign Office
                                that he would be reluctant for this to be done until he has had time
                                to consider the matter and to consult with the Chinese. He will then
                                send his further recommendations. The Foreign Office is telegraphing
                                to Ambassador Kerr tonight the substance of the American views, with
                                which the official said he agreed. The Chinese have not been
                                informed of the instructions sent to Ambassador Craigie.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Office appears to understand clearly our position and, in
                                view of our attitude and of the doubts expressed by the British
                                Ambassador in China as to the acceptability of a British approach to
                                the Japanese alone, it was stated by the official that they would
                                probably decide not to take the action at this time. He thought it
                                would be useful, however, for Ambassador Craigie to have the
                                exchange of views with Mr. Grew and that he would inform me of
                                further developments and of the recommendations which may be
                                expected from the Ambassador in China.</p>

                            <p>Confronted with the problem of defending Wuhan the Chinese fail to
                                show unity of purpose. The Central Government professes that a
                                determined stand will be made but in the opinion of foreign military
                                observers is now conserving and later will probably withdraw its
                                best troops and equipment to ensure its transcendency in domestic
                                politics. Central Government hope for victory in the present
                                hostilities still rests in the economic collapse of Japan and third
                                power economic or military intervention.</p>
                            <p>Declaring that with cooperation and determination Wuhan can be
                                another Madrid, the Communists published 2 months ago a
                                comprehensive plan for the defense of the Wuhan area, the salient
                                feature of which was the mobilization, training and arming of the
                                masses. Apprehending an increase of Communist strength if the people
                                are mobilized, the Central Government has blocked fulfillment of the
                                program even to the extent of preventing the Communists from
                                organizing labor and first aid corps for work at the front.</p>

                                    such an offer was not opportune. He remarked that Chiang Kai
                                    Shek himself is not intensely anti-Japanese but that he must
                                    bear the responsibility for the intensive anti-Japanese
                                    propaganda in the schools and elsewhere and that until he
                                    undergoes a conversion the Japanese Government cannot deal with
                                    him. Craigie interprets this as meaning “until the Generalissimo
                                    breaks with the Communists.” Nevertheless Craigie feels that
                                    Ugaki’s approach to this subject twice on his own initiative
                                    emphasizes the importance of “keeping the door open” for an
                                    eventual offer of good offices when the time appears opportune.
                                    Craigie believes that such a moment may arise after the fall of
                                    Hankow because he feels that even the army, after it had
                                    achieved that outstanding victory, would welcome an opportunity
                                    to retire from that area.</item>

                                    with the campaign and therefore he did not think the present

                                    alternative but to discriminate against Japan. Craigie believes
                                    that the Japanese will try to avoid a showdown until after the
                                    fall of Hankow and that they will then openly snap their fingers
                                    in Great Britain’s face.</item>

                                <item>Craigie says that he therefore proposes to recommend to his
                                    Government that since conciliatory efforts are proving abortive,
                                    his Government should now or soon radically alter its tactics
                                    and proceed to take all counter measures “short of a <hi
                                        rend="italic">casus belli</hi>” against Japan. He thinks
                                    that one of the first steps should be the denunciation of their
                                    Treaty of Commerce with Japan<note n="69" xml:id="d249fn69"

                                        p. 159.</note> and that other measures, such for instance as
                                    action in the discount market, should follow. In other words,
                                    said Craigie, the time has come when Great Britain must “show
                                    her teeth”. He added, as usual, that similar action by the
                                    United States would double the effectiveness of the measures
                                    taken but he also believes that discriminatory measures against
                                    American interests in China will be far less marked than those
                                    against Great Britain. He especially observed that Mr. Hull’s
                                    recent public statements condemning military aggression had
                                    mentioned no names whereas the name of Japan had been
                                    emphatically and disparagingly mentioned by British officials in
                                    Parliament. Craigie considers those British statements as
                                    unfortunate, particularly because at the same <pb n="266"

                                    proceed with plans for a loan to China which he thinks the
                                    Japanese interpret purely as a weakening of British
                                    determination.</item>

                            <p>791. My 770, August 15, 8 p.m. The Chinese Ambassador was informed at
                                the Foreign Office this morning that the British Government agrees
                                with the Government of the United States that the present moment is
                                not a propitious one for inviting the attention of the Japanese and
                                Chinese Governments to their standing offer of good offices. The
                                Chinese Ambassador at the same time had his attention again called
                                to the Prime Minister’s statement of July 26 and was informed that
                                the British Ambassador at Tokyo will continue to sound the
                                possibility of useful results from further suggestion of good
                                offices to the Japanese Government; and that there is not at the
                                moment any indication whatever that the Japanese attitude would be
                                receptive.</p>
                            <p>The British Government has instructed Ambassador Craigie to approach
                                the Japanese Foreign Minister regarding the most recent bombings at
                                Canton, pointing out to him the serious effect this continued
                                indiscriminate killing of civilians is having on the position of
                                Japan in public opinion abroad. The Foreign Office states that
                                numerous influential individuals, at the head of whom is the
                                Archbishop of Canterbury, as well as British organizations, are
                                exceedingly worked up about these last bombings and are bringing
                                constant pressure to bear on the Government here.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Henry W. Kinney, with whom I have had long acquaintance and who
                                is now attached to the Japanese Foreign Office, came to see me this
                                morning and talked at length about Sino-Japanese relations. A number
                                of remarks made by Mr. Kinney, some in response to my questions,
                                contained substance of possible interest to the Department and are
                                set forth below. Mr. Kinney has had important assignments as a
                                publicist for the Japanese Government, enjoys acquaintance with the
                                highest Japanese Government officials, and was called out of
                                retirement for his present mission which is to make a survey of
                                American opinion with respect to Far Eastern developments. Prior to
                                making the present trip to the United States, Mr. Kinney apparently
                                conferred with important members of the Japanese Cabinet and
                                Government, and it is, therefore, possible that certain of his
                                observations are entitled to more than ordinary notice.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kinney stated in regard to the hostilities in China that the
                                Tokyo Government was inclined to believe that the taking of Hankow
                                by the Japanese forces would probably disorganize Chinese opposition
                                and create dissension among its leaders, thus preparing the way for
                                peace.</p>
                            <p>In regard to possible peace terms that the Japanese may present in
                                the event of victory over the Chinese, Mr. Kinney observed that the
                                reasonableness of Japanese demands might prove a surprise in many
                                quarters; that actually it had been indicated to him by a high
                                Japanese official that indemnity would more likely be sought in the
                                form of economic concessions of various kinds than in money. Mr.
                                Kinney added that the Japanese could not expect to get a large money
                                indemnity from China when it was obvious that China was
                                impoverished.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kinney mentioned General Chiang Kai-shek and stated that he
                                believed the General had at the moment greater prestige with the
                                Chinese people than ever heretofore. This remark may represent a
                                translation by Mr. Kinney of views of members of the Japanese
                                Government.</p>
                            <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0272"/>
                            <p>With regard to the British position in China, Mr. Kinney observed
                                that the British appeared to desire peace possibly more than the
                                Japanese. He thought also that the British would take part in any
                                effort to bring about a peace conference provided there should be a
                                Chinese Government in prospect that could practically be recognized.
                                He added that he did not believe it mattered much to the British
                                what the composition of this Government might be so long as it would
                                work.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kinney stated that the object of his mission to the United States
                                was to take a cross section of American public opinion with respect
                                to Japanese activities in the Far East, that he had been engaged in
                                this task for some time, and that he proposed upon his return to
                                inform the Foreign Office that Japanese efforts to win American
                                support for their cause through propagandist activities should
                                cease. He thought such activities were a waste of effort in the
                                present temper of the American people, and that for some time to
                                come the Japanese would have to give evidence of their intentions
                                through actions rather than words.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kinney made some attempt to establish that relatively the Chinese
                                had offended against American interests in China to much the same
                                degree as had the Japanese. When I indicated that our records did
                                not appear to bear this out, Mr. Kinney dropped the matter, and it
                                was evident that he had merely attempted a pretense, at which he is

                                Office in the information given the Chinese Ambassador at London;
                                the Secretary merely posed a question, offered for consideration
                                general comments and indicated that additional action on our part
                                was not to be expected at this time. Your telegram would appear to
                                indicate that the information conveyed by the Foreign Office to the
                                Chinese Ambassador at London carried the implication that the <pb

                                negative decision on the question of good offices rested on this
                                Government. While we would have seen no objection to the British
                                Foreign Office informing the Chinese Ambassador that we had been
                                consulted and that our views were as indicated by us, we feel that
                                the Foreign Office should not have left, if indeed they did leave,
                                the Chinese Ambassador in any doubt that the British Government’s
                                decision was made on its own initiative.</p>

                                    and West Hopei and East Shansi under the control of Chinese
                                    guerrillas, associated with and now considered a part of the
                                    former Eighth Route Army of Communist troops, report that their
                                    organization is growing in efficiency and numerical strength.
                                    The headquarters of one of the four organized guerrilla
                                    districts in Hopei claims that there are 200,000 organized
                                    guerrillas in that province, that their chief lack is rifle
                                    ammunition, but that they are well supplied with hand grenades
                                    of their own manufacture and are obtaining considerable amounts
                                    of explosives. (It was reported in the second week of August
                                    that several bridges had been blown up near Techow on the
                                    Tientsin–Pukow Railway and that the line was interrupted for
                                    over 1 week. Several wrecks were also reported on the
                                    Peiping–Hankow Railway in Hopei, with at least 200 casualties in
                                    one wreck south of Paoting. At least one train was completely
                                    wrecked in July on the Shihkiachuang–Taiyuan Railway presumably
                                    with heavy casualties. Yesterday afternoon’s express from Mukden
                                    was derailed between Tangku and Tientsin.)</item>

                                    and lines of communications and in killing small detachments of
                                    Japanese, observers in general express surprise at the
                                    comparative ineffectiveness of the guerrillas as a military
                                    force, especially at their failure to destroy railways under
                                    Japanese control. Many observers, however, consider that their
                                    effectiveness is being increased as their training and
                                    organization progress, and it is reliably reported that Japanese
                                    attacks upon villages by planes and troops, and the policy of
                                    fear which is also reliably reported as being carried out by the
                                    Japanese against villages thought to harbor guerrillas, has
                                    turned the countryside population into active supporters of the
                                    organized irregulars, who in general treat the people well, with
                                    one result that frequently the survivers of Japanese attacks on
                                    civilians join with the guerrillas for active service. There are
                                    many indications that the guerrilla movement will continue to
                                    grow in Hopei, Shantung, and Shansi and that irregular
                                    activities, already a formidable problem to the Japanese
                                    military, will become a menace of increasingly greater
                                    magnitude.</item>

                            <p>810. I had no hesitancy in taking up informally with the Foreign
                                Office the substance of your 466, August 20, 2 p.m., as in the
                                conversation reported in my 770, August 15, 8 p.m., I had
                                specifically said that I thought it would be most desirable to avoid
                                giving the Chinese any impression that the British decision,
                                whatever it might be, was not an entirely independent one. The same
                                Foreign Office official this afternoon said that they agreed with
                                that view and that they had had no intention of conveying any such
                                impression to the Chinese Ambassador in the talk reported in my 791,
                                August 18, 2 p.m., nor did he think the Chinese Ambassador had
                                received any such impression. He produced a memorandum of the
                                conversation with the Chinese Ambassador of that day and read me
                                substantially as follows: The Chinese Ambassador was informed that
                                the suggestion of his Government made through the British Ambassador
                                in China had been <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0275"/>very
                                carefully examined here and that we had consulted with the United
                                States Government in the matter. I told him that we had come to the
                                conclusion that on the whole we concurred with the viewpoint of the
                                United States Government that the present was not a propitious
                                moment for inviting the attention of the Chinese and Japanese
                                Governments to the standing offer of good offices. The Chinese
                                Ambassador in reply said that personally he was of the same opinion
                                and that he thought the time for again bringing forward the offer of
                                good offices must be very carefully chosen.</p>
                            <p>I had not been informed until this afternoon of the fact that the
                                Chinese Ambassador had personally concurred in the decision.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Office has perfectly understood the nature of the
                                statement made by the Secretary in his talk with the Chinese
                                Ambassador at Washington on August 3.</p>

                            <p>426. The spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Office, according to the
                                local Chinese press of August 25, denied rumors apparently emanating
                                from London to the effect that Italy is endeavoring to mediate in
                                the Far Eastern hostilities and that a tentative approach had been
                                made by the latter to Wang Ching-wei in the matter. A spokesman
                                declared that Italy had not approached China on the subject and that
                                the rumor was probably fabricated by the Japanese for ulterior
                                reasons.</p>

                                <item>In a recent conversation with H. H. Kung, the latter, in
                                    making reference to the truce reached between Russia and Japan
                                    over the Changkufeng incident, told me that he was puzzled as to
                                    why Germany had intervened in that matter to advise the Japanese
                                    that they should not so aggravate the situation as to become
                                    involved in a war with Russia. Dr. Kung is apparently convinced
                                    that Germany acted in the sense described above and that as a
                                    result he is seeking to moderate the situation on the
                                    Manchurian-Siberian border.</item>

                                <item>Linked with the above is a conversation which I recently had
                                    with Alessandrini, local representative of the Italian Embassy
                                    in China, who in the course of a discussion of the Sino-Japanese
                                    hostilities commented to the effect that the Japanese military
                                    were making a hopeless mess of their program and activities in
                                    China. He added that the Italian Government had informed the
                                    Japanese Government that Italy had no desire to become involved
                                    in an international war precipitated by Japan.</item>

                                    conclusion that neither Germany nor Italy is pleased with the
                                    manner in which Japan has been acting in the Far East; and that
                                    these two powers have intimated to Japan that the latter cannot
                                    depend upon them for assistance in case Japan should become
                                    involved in hostilities with the Soviet Union.</item>

                                Adviser of the Ministry of Finance, is coming to your country, I am
                                pleased to take this opportunity to convey to you through him my
                                best wishes and sincere greetings. I recall the great kindness you
                                extended to me during my sojourn in Washington last year, and
                                enjoyed the luncheon and talk with you.</p>
                            <p>On Mr. Chen’s departure for America, we recall with renewed
                                appreciation the kind reception which you extended to him and his
                                colleagues during their monetary mission to Washington in 1936 and
                                particularly the friendly cooperation of your Government which made
                                his mission a success.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Chen is now coming to America on another mission. Your friendship
                                towards our Government justifies my hope that Mr. Chen’s mission
                                will again receive the ready assistance of your Government.<note

                            <p>Ever since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese hostilities, you and
                                your Government and people have shown unmistakable signs of
                                friendship towards China. Your sympathy and moral support of our
                                national cause and the humanitarian services which your nation has
                                rendered in the relief of our war refugees have won the deep
                                gratitude of our Government and people. The timely and courageous
                                utterances you have made in the interest of peace and justice,
                                particularly, not only represent America’s traditional policy in the
                                Far East but ring through the world like clarion calls warning all
                                peace-loving and democratic peoples against the grave dangers of the
                                forces of aggression and lawlessness. Indeed, they symbolize
                                America’s moral leadership in world affairs, so ably strengthened by
                                your statesmanship.</p>
                            <p>Much as we regret the interruptions to our financial and economic
                                development that have been caused by Japan’s armed aggression, we
                                are nevertheless resolutely and courageously facing the urgent
                                problems that confront us in the present crisis. I need hardly say
                                that the continued friendship and assistance of America will not
                                only be helpful in the successful prosecution of our war against
                                Japan’s aggression but will be even more valuable when we come to
                                tackle the greater problems that will arise at the end of the
                                hostilities. I have every confidence that, under your illustrious
                                leadership, our two nations will cooperate closer than ever in
                                protecting our common ideals of peace and democracy in the Pacific
                                and in promoting your noble policy of “Good Neighborhood.”</p>

                                    leaders; though impressed with Mao Tse Tung’s undoubted ability,
                                    he felt Lo Fu, Secretary General of the party and a recluse, to
                                    be the most capable official of the Communist Party. He found
                                    Shensi to be of great strategic value to the Chinese as it
                                    provides the route whereby supplies reach Suiyuan, Shansi and
                                    even Hopei; consequently Chinese defenses along the Yellow River
                                    were ascertained to be formidable, with central troops stationed
                                    in South and North Shensi and with Communist troops in the
                                    central section.</item>

                                    to the success of the Communists in organizing and gaining the
                                    support of the populace under a fixed program designed, (1) to
                                    prevent Japan from gaining political control of the areas in
                                    question, (2) to prevent commercial or other intercourse with
                                    Japanese dominated areas, (3) to obstruct Japanese exploitation
                                    of the natural resources of these areas.</item>

                                <item>In Shantung friction was observed to exist between Shen Hung
                                    Lieh, chairman of the province, and the Soviets who have
                                    penetrated into the province and who desire to expand their
                                    system of organization of the people along the lines followed in
                                    Hopei and Shansi. Shen has not accepted the proposals and has
                                    hesitated to affiliate the people under his own supervision. He
                                    has however restored communications and has taken steps to
                                    organize a local army of about 120,000 men.</item>

                                <item>Carlson emphasizes that the Communist plan of organizing the
                                    people is meeting with marked success whereas similar efforts on
                                    the part of the Central Government have fallen short. He
                                    observed that the Soviets are winning the support of the people,
                                    that in consequence they now control a large section of North
                                    China extending from Kansu to the sea, and that their strength
                                    and influence are constantly on the increase. Carlson believes
                                    that the Communists intend to remain loyal to the Central
                                    Government during the course of hostilities and says they
                                    profess to hope to be able to continue the united front after
                                    the war, looking ultimately to the establishment in China of a
                                    democratic form of Government, but with official control of
                                    banks, mines, railways, public utilities, et cetera, and with
                                    cooperatives as the basis of distribution. Subject to the above
                                    mentioned limitations, <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0279"

                                    foreign capital encouraged from nations treating China as an
                                    equal. He pointed out, however, that if a rift should occur, the
                                    Communists will be in a strong position vis-à-vis the Central
                                    Government.</item>

                                <item>I believe Carlson has made a competent and sound survey of the
                                    trend of developments in the areas in which he has traveled. If
                                    support is forthcoming from Soviet Russia, Chinese Communist
                                    influence will doubtless continue to grow in North China and
                                    Japan, which has yet to crush the Chiang regime, will find it
                                    more difficult as time passes to eradicate this growing power in
                                    the north, while the possibility of large scale Japanese
                                    exploitation of North China seems remote so long as the
                                    Communists are able to carry on their activities in that
                                    area.</item>

                                    he reverted to the five principal points of British desiderata
                                    in China which the British Government consider as representing
                                    its minimum requirements and regard compliance therewith as a
                                    minimum criterion of Japanese sincerity. As reported in my 543,
                                    August 18, 2 p.m., the Foreign Minister<note n="78"

                                    previously intimated that these points would be given favorable
                                    consideration said on August 17 that no concessions to Great
                                    Britain could be made at the present time owing to the
                                    threatening nature of statements in Parliament and suggested
                                    that Craigie come to see him again on August 31. This
                                    appointment was later canceled and the Foreign Minister now
                                    proposes to see the British Ambassador some time next week. In
                                    that interview unless the Foreign Minister is able to give
                                    satisfactory assurances for the future Craigie proposes to tell
                                    General Ugaki that his Government can believe no longer in
                                    Japan’s sincerity and that since his own efforts at friendly
                                    conciliation have proved abortive the British Government will
                                    now be obliged to adopt other methods. Craigie does not yet know
                                    whether these measures would take the form of help to China or
                                    retaliation against Japan. The decision must be left to his
                                    Government which is under constant pressure to take some action
                                    of this delicate nature.</item>

                                <item>In trying to estimate the reasons for the postponement of his
                                    interview with the Foreign Minister, Craigie is inclined to
                                    attribute it to Ugaki’s difficulties with the military or
                                    possibly to a desire to await the outcome of the present
                                    European crisis. He has been informed that the inept publicity
                                    that a series of “Ugaki-Craigie conversations[”] taking place
                                    has served to antagonize the army which believes that the
                                    Foreign Office is weak and inclined to make undesirable
                                    concessions to foreign interests. Craigie is informed that
                                    Ugaki’s prestige and influence have greatly weakened and that
                                    there is serious risk of some attack on him by young military
                                    officers of reactionary tendencies.</item>

                                    out the possibility of such an incident and we feel a certain
                                    tenseness in the air but I understand that the authorities have
                                    sent most of the young malcontents to the front lines in China
                                    and it seems probable that the local authorities are in a
                                    position to control those who remain in Tokyo.</item>

                                    <p>In regard to the abuse by the Chinese forces of third party
                                        rights: The experiences during the hostilities in the
                                        western part of Shanghai last year fully evidence that, in
                                        the event that the Chinese forces confront the Japanese
                                        forces in the vicinity of foreign property or use such
                                        property as cover, as an unavoidable consequence the
                                        property of third parties is unintentionally subjected to
                                        fire.</p>
                                    <p>Accordingly it is particularly to be added that as long as
                                        there are Chinese military forces or military emplacements
                                        within 1,000 meters from the outer edge of the established
                                        area at Hankow herein referred to, it is exceedingly
                                        difficult for the Imperial forces to bear responsibility for
                                        unforeseen damages to the rights and interests of third
                                        parties which may occur as a result of an attack on such
                                        Chinese forces or emplacements.”</p>

                            <p>The British Ambassador called at his request. He referred to
                                statements made to him by the Secretary when the Ambassador was
                                calling on the Secretary last Saturday to the effect that it seemed
                                desirable that thought be given to matters as follows: the question
                                presented by the Japanese objections to the passage of the U. S. S.
                                    <hi rend="italic">Monocacy</hi> to Shanghai; the question
                                whether additional representations of a broad character were called
                                for by the continued Japanese activity in the field of commercial
                                enterprise which resulted in impairment of our commercial rights;
                                and the question whether approaches should be made to the Japanese
                                Government along the lines of the approaches made to Germany during
                                the World War in reference to Japanese pronouncements that certain
                                areas constituted zones of hostilities within which third party
                                interests could not operate or could operate only at their own risk.
                                The Ambassador asked me whether I could throw any further light on
                                these matters.</p>
                            <p>I said that with reference to the U. S. S. <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Monocacy</hi> the British also had a gunboat at Kiukiang and
                                that there was involved in this matter the whole question of freedom
                                of movement on the Yangtze. I said that all the treaty powers having
                                naval vessels or commercial vessels on the Yangtze were confronted
                                by this large problem.</p>
                            <p>With regard to our commercial interests in China and the steps being
                                taken by the Japanese through the formation of special companies,

                                close the open door to other foreign enterprises, I said that this
                                Government, like the British Government, had been making
                                representations in regard to individual cases affecting our
                                respective interests as such cases arose. I said that quite recently
                                the British Ambassador at Tokyo had presented to the Japanese
                                Government a list of certain desiderata relating to British
                                interests in China. I said that on July 4 Mr. Grew had taken up with
                                the Japanese Foreign Office in a broad, comprehensive way the
                                question of American rights and interests in China.<note n="84"

                                that in addition to these approaches and to the representations
                                which were made in individual cases, we were giving thought to the
                                question whether it would be advisable to approach the Japanese
                                Government in any more comprehensive and thoroughgoing manner than
                                had heretofore been the case.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the assertion by the Japanese Government from time to
                                time that certain areas constituted zones of military operations, I
                                said that, as the Ambassador knew, during the World War this
                                Government had made representations to the German Government as well
                                as to the British Government in regard to our inability to recognize
                                the right of those governments to delimit large areas as areas
                                within which American vessels could not operate. I said that in
                                reference to the situation in China this Government had made
                                representations to the Japanese Government on the occasion of the
                                Japanese Government issuing certain of its notices of the character
                                under discussion. I said that we did not admit that the Japanese
                                Government had belligerent rights and that we proceeded on that
                                basis, at the same time endeavoring to have our action conform to
                                the rule of reason. I said that we were giving study to the question
                                whether it would be advisable to make a general and comprehensive
                                approach to the Japanese Government on this whole question. I added
                                that I personally would prefer, if any such approach were to be
                                made, to have it rest on a case involving completely American rights
                                and interests rather than on a case of only a partial American
                                interest, such as that of the China National Aviation
                                Corporation.</p>

                            <p>During his call the Chinese Ambassador inquired as to the attitude of
                                this Government towards a reconvening of the signatories of the
                                Nine-Power Pact, to which I replied that I had not heard the matter
                                discussed recently. The Ambassador then said that his Government
                                would be making such a request and our Government would be expected
                                to take the lead in the matter; that he would be glad if he could
                                get some intimation as to what we might do. I asked him if it would
                                not be very advisable first to consider and determine whether any
                                accomplishment would be possible in the event of such meeting, and
                                stated that it would be hurtful to call a meeting which would prove
                                entirely fruitless. I said that while the delegate of this
                                government might be chairman of the meeting (and about this I am not
                                certain at the moment), in any event all of the signatories of the
                                Nine-Power Pact would be consulted and all would consider the
                                circumstances relating to the question of whether a reconvening
                                would be advisable; that, therefore, I assumed the Chinese
                                Government would lay its reasons before each of the signatories to
                                the Nine-Power Pact, who in turn would among themselves give
                                consideration to the same and the weight of opinion among them
                                determine as to whether there should or should not be a reconvening
                                of the Nine-Power signatories. The Ambassador then said that when
                                the Council of the League of Nations convenes later in this
                                    month<note n="85" xml:id="d264fn85">See <ref target="#pg_488"
                                        >pp. 488</ref> ff.</note> his Government would seek more
                                active aid from the League Council and also from the signatories of
                                the Nine-Power Pact; that it would strengthen that movement if this
                                Government in the meantime should have rendered important aid to
                                China. I made no reply but inquired what Great Britain, France, and
                                other countries, are doing in this respect. The Ambassador replied
                                that he did not know.</p>

                                <item>The Minister for Foreign Affairs received my British colleague
                                    this afternoon and in a 2-hour session did nearly all the
                                    talking, reading from copious notes with which Craigie believes
                                    he was furnished by the military authorities.</item>

                                <item>The Minister began with a long statement in which he charged
                                    Great Britain with aiding Chiang Kai Shek and said that until
                                    the British attitude should change, improvement in
                                    Anglo-Japanese relations could not be expected. Specifically he
                                    charged the British Navy with an attitude and actions contrary
                                    to Japanese interests while indicating that the American Navy
                                    had followed a correct course throughout the hostilities.</item>

                                <item>The Minister said that the fall of Hankow is imminent and that
                                    as soon as this occurs a strong Chinese central government will
                                    emerge which will cooperate with Japan and will render useless
                                    further assistance to Chiang Kai Shek.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>The Minister then proceeded to reject scheme for the five
                                    points which Craigie had presented on July 26 (see our 494, July
                                    27, 3 p.m.). Such reasons as the Minister advanced for this
                                    rejection centered about the requirements of the military
                                    campaign and the terrorist activities of Chinese in Shanghai.
                                    Under the heading “railways” the Minister made a single minor
                                    concession, namely, that the nominees of the British-Chinese
                                    Corporation would be permitted to inspect the North Station in
                                    Shanghai. With regard to the Whangpoo conservancy, the Minister
                                    thought that an agreement through local negotiations was
                                    impending. (Craigie at this point told me of his regret that the
                                    provisional agreement, which he considered reasonable, had
                                    failed owing to French objection.) When Craigie endeavored to
                                    discuss his five points specifically, the Minister pleaded
                                    ignorance of the details which he said were better understood by
                                    the Vice-Minister.<note n="86" xml:id="d265fn86">Kensuke
                                        Horinouchi.</note> Craigie replied that affairs of such
                                    importance should properly be discussed in detail by an
                                    ambassador with the Foreign Minister himself. He feels that
                                    Ugaki has no detailed comprehension of these matters.</item>

                                <item>At the end of the interview Craigie conveyed to the Foreign
                                    Minister, not as formal representations but as a personal
                                    message from Lord Halifax,<note n="87" xml:id="d265fn87">British

                                <item>Craigie characterized the interview as completely unfavorable
                                    and discouraging. He has noted in the last few days a
                                    recrudescence of anti-British publicity in the Japanese press
                                    and has observed that this publicity so closely follows comments
                                    made to him by the Foreign Office as to render certain that this
                                    propaganda is officially inspired.</item>

                                <item>Craigie informs me in strict secrecy that owing to the crisis
                                    in Europe he has been directed by his Government to avoid a
                                    showdown with the Japanese Government at present and to carry on
                                    as best he can.</item>

                            <p>591. Our 590, September 8, 11 p.m. Craigie informs me that in his
                                talk yesterday with the Minister for Foreign Affairs Ugaki held up
                                the United States as a paragon of virtue in contradistinction to
                                Great Britain. This tends to bear out reliable reports which have
                                come to us to the effect that there is a strong element within the
                                Japanese Government which advocates (in the observation of one
                                informant) “throwing Great Britain out of China and at the same time
                                conciliating and favoring the United States”. This informant added
                                however that the predominant view in the Foreign Office is that the
                                United States and Great Britain must be considered for all practical
                                purposes in connection with the Far Eastern situation as one unit
                                and that Japan cannot take aggressive measures against the interests
                                of either nation without eventually becoming involved with the
                                other.</p>

                                commander that these defences are being erected under orders of a
                                higher military authority when he was approached by the senior
                                Consul at Hankow raises the question whether I should, either as
                                senior Ambassador or as American Ambassador with nationals residing
                                within the two ex-concessions mentioned, protest to the higher
                                authorities in the matter. I am diffident about approaching the
                                Chinese authorities in this matter as it would be impossible for me
                                to offer any guarantee whatever to the Chinese authorities as to the
                                fate which may be meted out to Chinese citizens found within those
                                areas by the Japanese. Similar defensive works apparently were
                                erected within the area where foreigners were living in Kiukiang and
                                yet it is apparent that the Japanese forces in taking Kiukiang were
                                careful of foreign property in that area. I have hitherto taken the
                                stand that I could not be responsible for more than informing
                                Japanese of the location of American property and the presence of
                                American nationals and hold them responsible for their protection. I
                                am not disposed to go to the Chinese authorities about this matter
                                and protest against steps which they are apparently taking for the
                                protection of their own lives for I can offer no substitute. Unless
                                the Department desires otherwise I propose to take no action with
                                the Chinese, relying upon what we have already said to the Japanese
                                about the location of American properties in those areas for their
                                protection.</p>

                                            Wuchang. The specified area at Hankow consists very

                                            foreign community concentrated in that area, and, as the

                                            citizens and American property in Wuchang.</item>

                            <p>446. Department’s 245, September 9, 5 p.m., paragraph 2. I do not see
                                how we can adopt same attitude toward Chinese as towards Japanese
                                since Chinese are attempting to defend their own nationals and their
                                property against attack by Japanese without assuming responsibility
                                for such protection. It devolves upon the Japanese to do everything
                                possible to protect non-combatant Chinese and foreigners within zone
                                of their activities. Therefore I do not see how we can ask Chinese
                                authorities to avoid military activities adjacent to specified area
                                at Hankow especially as Japanese advance may have the effect of
                                driving fighting Chinese back into that adjacent area. As we are in
                                all cases uncertain as to Japanese definition of military activities
                                it would in any case be difficult for us to ask Chinese to avoid
                                activities “that would give Japanese an excuse for attacking that
                                area on the grounds” outlined in Japanese note. It seems clear to me
                                that if we were to attempt to carry out the Japanese conditions and
                                were to fail as would be probable the danger to our nationals would
                                be increased because the Japanese in that event would feel
                                themselves absolved from responsibility for the safety of American
                                citizens. I am repeating the Department’s telegram to Hankow and am
                                requesting comments on the question of feasible measures of
                                safeguarding lives and property of Americans through Josselyn of
                                Military Attaché and Commander of Yangtze Patrol<note n="95"

                                    N.</note> (whose immediate problem this will be), but in my
                                opinion Americans at Hankow will run no greater risks than they have
                                run at Kiukiang, Hsuchow, and Kaifeng during present hostilities,
                                provided they remain as much <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0291"
                                />aloof from actual fighting areas as may be possible. The Consul
                                General at Hankow and the Commander of the Yangtze Patrol have taken
                                all of these contingencies into consideration and will I am sure
                                have made every arrangement humanely possible to enable Americans to
                                avail themselves of shelter away from the scene of active
                                hostilities.</p>

                            <p>596. I am told on fairly substantial authority<note n="97"
                                    xml:id="d275fn97">Vice President of the Japanese House of
                                    Representatives.</note> that the Emperor has given his approval
                                to plans for a move on Canton after the fall of Hankow. The same
                                source of information indicates that an attack on Soviet Russia may
                                likewise take place after the fall of Hankow.</p>
                            <p>I do not think that these reports should be accepted as certainly
                                reliable but feel impelled to pass them on to the Department in view
                                of the substantial character of the informant and in order that due
                                consideration may be given in advance to the possibility that the
                                reported plans may materialize.</p>
                            <p>It seems logical in this connection to consider the important
                                influence which the present crisis in Europe must exert on Japanese
                                policy both with regard to Great Britain and Soviet Russia and the
                                probability <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0292"/>that such
                                policy and future decisions will depend in great measure on trend of
                                European developments.</p>

                                Shanghai for verification. In regard to paragraphs 2 and 3, the

                                feel impelled to the conclusion that in the circumstances existing
                                at Hankow it would be useless and inappropriate to ask the Chinese
                                to conduct their military activities in a way to avoid endangering
                                American life and property. The Chinese are on the defensive in the
                                area in question and, short of abandoning it to Japanese occupation,
                                there would seem to be no way for them to comply with this request
                                if made. I repeated Department’s 245, September 9, 5 p.m. to Hankow
                                and asked the Consul General to ascertain and submit to the
                                Department the views of the Military Attaché and Commander of
                                Yangtze Patrol regarding its subject matter (including of course the

                            <p>Mayor of Hankow informed me orally this morning that due to military
                                necessity Chinese intend to erect defenses on the various foreign
                                properties above Seven Mile creek [which] include the installations
                                of the Standard Oil Company and the Texas Company unless a guarantee
                                were given that Japanese will not utilize such properties to land
                                troops. I replied I was sure that we could give no such assurances
                                but that such defenses would constitute grave danger to the American
                                property and I would have to object. Colonel Stilwell who visited

                            <p>449. Hankow’s September 13, 7 p.m., offers a specific case where the
                                responsible Chinese authorities are apparently prepared to refrain
                                from defending a part of the river bank below Hankow which forms
                                frontage of an American owned property whereon is stored the only
                                oil supply available to American naval vessels remaining at Hankow
                                to perform mission of protecting American lives provided we will
                                guarantee that hostile Japanese forces will not use property to land
                                troops in attack on Hankow. Attitude taken by Consul General in
                                Consular Body [<hi rend="italic">conversation with?</hi>] Hankow
                                mayor seems only attitude we should take and yet Chinese willingness
                                to refrain from erection of defense works on property mentioned
                                provided we can prevent use by Japanese suggests possible basis for
                                request to Japanese to refrain from using property in question.
                                Otherwise property will be threatened with destruction. Of course it
                                is quite possible that as in similar case at Kiukiang nothing will
                                happen even in the absence of such an arrangement. I would like to
                                have Department’s advice in instructing Hankow.</p>

                                        >p. 285</ref>.</note> as to whether the newspaper report is
                                true that they have protested to Chiang Kai Shek against
                                “obstructive” attitude in regard to establishment of safety zone at
                                Hankow, and specifically against erection of fortifications in
                                vicinity of safety zone. The report is not correct. On September 9
                                the British Ambassador instructed his representative at Hankow to
                                inquire whether the Chinese were willing to accept in principle the
                                Japanese conditions for the establishment of a safety zone. This
                                inquiry was made in agreement with the French Ambassador. Both
                                Ambassadors confirmed this and the British Ambassador informed me
                                today that a reply has been published from his representative
                                stating that Chiang Kai Shek has categorically rejected the proposal
                                and has let it be known in unmistakable terms that there is no
                                chance whatsoever of acceptance of the Japanese conditions. The
                                British Ambassador stated that Chiang Kai Shek took exception to the
                                Japanese offer and stated <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> that he
                                was not only fighting for China but for all the democracies of the
                                world. The British Ambassador stated that Chiang Kai Shek’s attitude
                                toward the safety zone proposal as now revealed is a complete <hi

                            <p>1471. Mandel, Minister of Colonies, said to me today that 2 days ago
                                the Japanese had occupied a small island about 25 miles from the
                                coast of the Island of Hainan and had bombarded Hainan. He expressed
                                the opinion that this action of the Japanese Navy was not unrelated
                                to the extreme tension which had arisen in Europe over the
                                Czechoslovak crisis.</p>

                                    from the foreign residential and business area concerning which
                                    we approached the Japanese without reference to any undertaking
                                    on the part of the Chinese. That area from its beginning has
                                    been identified with foreign interests and administration and
                                    has been a special place set aside for foreign residence and

                                    American Government agency obtained and passed on such
                                    assurances, and if thereafter, in the stress of fighting,
                                    advantage were unfairly taken by either side of the situation
                                    thus produced, American authorities, because of their action in
                                    having partaken in the exchange of such assurances, would have
                                    the responsibility of an unfortunate association with the

                                    expressed in your 446, September 11, noon, and 447, September
                                    13, 4 p.m., in regard to the difference between the Japanese and
                                    Chinese positions in relation to foreign lives and property at
                                    Hankow and fully appreciates the point made by you that the
                                    Chinese are on the defensive there. The Department believes,
                                    however, that a considerable latitude of action in the
                                    formulation of defense measures is open to the Chinese and that
                                    such measures might be designed either to invite or to
                                    discourage hostilities in the neighborhood of the foreign
                                    residential area, without material sacrifice of legitimate
                                    military considerations. The Department, with the foregoing in
                                    mind, believes that it would be entirely appropriate for you and
                                    the American Consul General at Hankow to exert every effort, as
                                    occasion offers, to keep before the Chinese authorities the
                                    location of American nationals and property to the end that the
                                    Chinese take measures to avoid, within the latitude indicated
                                    above, measures that would tend to endanger American lives and
                                    property.</item>

                                <item>Carrying on their series of conversations the Minister for
                                    Foreign Affairs received my British colleague towards the end of
                                    last week and according to Craigie reiterated his previous
                                    observation that until Great Britain should “desert Chiang Kai
                                    Shek” and should cease aiding him Japanese concessions to Great
                                    Britain in China would be impossible. Craigie pointed out that
                                    while British moral sympathy lay with Chiang Kai Shek there had
                                    been little material assistance afforded him and that Germany
                                    and other nations had supplied him with arms and ammunition far
                                    exceeding British supplies. Craigie furthermore pointed out that
                                    the Japanese grievances against the British Navy, mentioned by
                                    the Minister at their last interview, chiefly concerned
                                    individual acts by officers and men which did not necessarily
                                    represent the attitude of the British Government. He received
                                    today a more detailed list of grievances which the Minister
                                    undertook to furnish him at their next interview. Craigie’s five
                                    points were again discussed without favorable result.</item>

                                <item>Ugaki then asked Craigie whether he was now in a position to
                                    give assurances as to Great Britain’s intention to cooperate
                                    with Japan in China “in future”. Craigie replied that until
                                    current difficulties were settled it was obviously impossible to
                                    give future assurances.</item>

                                <item>In analyzing the situation Craigie notes that a marked change
                                    in the attitude of the Japanese Government toward Great Britain
                                    took place toward the end of July at about the time of the
                                    return of the German Ambassador from Berlin, and while Craigie
                                    realizes that the adverse statements of representatives of the
                                    British Government in Parliament may have influenced the issue,
                                    he is now inclined to believe that messages from the German
                                    Government conveyed by General Ott forecasted the European
                                    crisis and tended to stiffen Japan’s back towards Great
                                    Britain.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>I called Craigie’s attention to a press report to the effect
                                    that the Japanese Ambassador in Rome had recently assured the
                                    Italian Government of Japan’s support of Italy and Germany in
                                    the event of war. This report, as well as a similar statement
                                    made by the spokesman of the Foreign Office in Tokyo last week,
                                    Craigie proposes to discuss with the Vice Minister for Foreign
                                    Affairs today and says he will inform me tomorrow of the result.
                                    It seems to me preferable to obtain an interpretation of those
                                    reported statements by this indirect method rather than by a
                                    direct approach to the Foreign Office myself.</item>

                                <item>In our ensuing conversation Craigie expatiated on the great
                                    importance both to British and American interests in China of
                                    maintaining Chiang Kai Shek in the picture, more especially in
                                    case of a European war, and expressed his belief that even a
                                    comparatively nominal “subsidy” by Great Britain and the United
                                    States would exert a perhaps decisive effect. Once again I
                                    explained to Craigie the position of the American Government in
                                    these matters.</item>

                                troops the Japanese Government was becoming increasingly
                                dissatisfied with the treatment accorded Japanese coal and oil
                                concessionaires in North Sakhalin by Soviet officials and had lodged
                                new protests with regard thereto. Soviet officials, according to the
                                Embassy’s information, were alleged to have pursued such obstructive
                                tactics that half of the short four-months’ working season was
                                consumed in futile attempts to obtain Soviet laborers to work the

                                of the Supreme Soviet of the U. S. S. R., on September 4, 1938. In a

                                credentials, General Yang expressed admiration for the successes of
                                the Soviet Union and for what he characterized as the new culture
                                and new life of the Union “under the highly gifted leadership of
                                Lenin and Stalin”. He expressed his conviction that “basing itself
                                on what it has already attained and forging ahead, the Soviet Union,
                                by its example and by its tremendous moral influence, will guarantee

                                of Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kai-shek and stated that in the

                                of Soviet assistance to China in its fight against Japan, press
                                reports continue to circulate here of the actuality of such

                                as, less insistent, reports of tanks and military instructors.
                                Recently, in discussing present conditions in China, a member of the
                                Chinese Embassy said that China is no longer having difficulty in
                                obtaining military supplies and intimated that a portion of them are
                                coming from the Soviet Union. He stated in this connection that it
                                is an open secret that the purpose of the present Chinese Mission
                                here is to obtain as much military assistance as possible.</p>

                                    intended to align herself with Germany and Italy. The intention
                                    of the statement was to show that Japan as a party to the
                                    Anti-Comintern Pact was concerned in combating the Comintern
                                    activities which the Japanese Government believed to be largely
                                    responsible for present difficulties in Czechoslovakia. The Vice

                                    in the event of a general war in Europe, Japan has made no

                                <item>It is impossible at this time to make any estimate of Japanese
                                    attitude in a situation which may have developed in Europe
                                    beyond the opening gambit. It is our opinion that in the
                                    circumstances predicated Japan will take no initiative toward,
                                    or alternatively will try to avoid, becoming involved. We base
                                    our conclusions on the following considerations: (<hi
                                        rend="italic">a</hi>) As a corollary to the fundamental
                                    Japanese policy of seeking to eliminate Occidental political
                                    influence from the Far East, there has been since 1931 steady
                                    withdrawal by Japan from participation in the affairs of Europe;
                                        (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) with a declining export trade,
                                    Japan has thus far been able to finance purchase of munitions
                                    for the conflict with China and of other necessary primary
                                    commodities only by resort to drastic trade control. Even if
                                    Japan were to remain neutral, the worldwide economic
                                    dislocations which must inevitably follow an outbreak of a
                                    general European war would add immeasurably to her difficulties,
                                    first, in maintaining her overseas markets and second, in
                                    procuring munitions and raw materials. There is very grave doubt
                                    whether in such circumstances she could afford to lose, by
                                    joining Germany, her British, French and possibly other markets
                                    and sources of supply. There is some optimistic speculation over
                                    the possibility of Japan benefitting by decrease of European
                                    goods in world markets, but the question arises whether Japan
                                    has the resources necessary to exploit such opportunity.</item>

                                message of the Government of the United States decoded and
                                transcribed at 1 o’clock, and was placed in the hands of a
                                responsible official of the Foreign Office at 1:05 in anticipation
                                of my appointment with the Minister for Foreign Affairs at 2:50. At
                                that hour, opening the conversation, I observed to the Minister that
                                this is a moment of the utmost gravity in the history of
                                civilization and a moment at which decisions and actions may
                                fundamentally influence the future course of civilization. The
                                message of the American Government was then presented both orally
                                and in an informal paper so that the text would be clear on the
                                record, accompanied by a written transcription of the text of the
                                President’s appeal to the Chancellor of the German Reich, the
                                President of Czechoslovakia and the Prime Ministers of Great Britain
                                and France.<note n="14" xml:id="d290fn14">See President Roosevelt’s

                                interview, the Minister replied substantially as follows: <quote

                                    <p>I would express on behalf of the Japanese Government full
                                        agreement with the action taken by the President of the
                                        United States in the controversy between Germany and
                                        Czechoslovakia. As you are aware, Japan is always desirous
                                        of peace and although unfortunately engaged at the present
                                        time in hostilities in China, Japan hopes to establish there
                                        conditions of peace. We also seek a peaceful settlement
                                        between Germany and Czechoslovakia, but there is a question
                                        whether action by Japan similar to that taken by the
                                        President would <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0305"/>be
                                        efficacious. We must give careful consideration to what
                                        action we, as Japan, may best take, from the point of view
                                        of our own position. At the same time we firmly share the
                                        convictions expressed by the President.</p>

                            <p>630. Embassy’s 628, September 28, 3 p.m. An hour ago I was approached
                                by the Foreign Office as to how I would feel about the Japanese
                                Government’s giving publicity to my call this afternoon on the
                                Foreign Minister and to his expression of appreciation for and
                                agreement in the spirit in which the President sent his message. I
                                stated that in my opinion any publicity to favorable reaction on the
                                part of the Japanese Government would be all to the good. I am now
                                given to understand that the Minister shares this view and that a
                                release will be given out in such tone.</p>

                                <item>In conversation today the Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                    told my British colleague that there had been no change in the
                                    attitude of the Japanese Government towards a possible conflict
                                    in Europe since their interview on September 19, but
                                    acknowledged that the Government was under great and increasing
                                    pressure from reactionary elements and especially from the
                                    various patriotic societies, now being consolidated and incited
                                    under the leadership of Toyama, to join Germany and Italy
                                    actively in war, should war occur. The Vice Minister said that
                                    the principal basis for this movement was the strong
                                    anti-British feeling in Japan engendered by the supposition that
                                    Great Britain’s support of Chiang Kai Shek is largely
                                    responsible for the latter’s continued resistance to Japanese
                                    arms. The Vice Minister acknowledged that this supposition was a
                                    misconception of the facts but said that the theory generally
                                    existed none the less.</item>

                                <item>Craigie and Horinouchi were in agreement that some substantial
                                    gesture indicative of Anglo-Japanese friendship might serve to
                                    improve the atmosphere although it does not appear that any
                                    concrete proposals were discussed or advanced.</item>

                                    Foreign Office expressing the full agreement of the Japanese
                                    Government with the action taken by the President in the
                                    controversy between Germany and Czechoslovakia (see our 630,
                                    September 28, 6 p.m.) will be very helpful as placing the
                                    Japanese Government’s attitude squarely on record. The Vice
                                    Minister, in referring to my <hi rend="italic">démarche</hi> to
                                    the Minister this afternoon, told Craigie that the reason for
                                    the hesitancy of the Japanese Government to accede to our
                                    Government’s proposal that it take action similar to that of the
                                    President was the feeling that being engaged in hostilities
                                    itself, it might be embarrassing for Japan to issue such an
                                    appeal to other nations.</item>

                            <p>Indications have come from China that some Japanese (apparently some
                                Army authorities and some civilian elements) are giving
                                consideration to the possible taking of steps toward seizing areas
                                at important ports which have been and are under the administrative
                                jurisdiction of occidental powers, especially Great Britain and
                                France. From time to time certain Japanese Army officers have made
                                threats that in certain contingencies Japanese forces might occupy
                                the International Settlement (and the French Concession?) at
                                Shanghai. Recently, at Tientsin, there have been controversies
                                between Japanese elements and the authorities of the British and the
                                French Concessions; from some Japanese quarters there have emanated
                                demands that the Japanese authorities take drastic steps; and it is
                                reported that the Japanese military are building an encircling
                                roadway around the boundaries of the two concessions. Today, it is
                                reported from Shanghai that stories are current there of a recent
                                landing at the port of 10,000 Japanese soldiers. During the past few
                                days of anxiety with regard to developments in Europe, there has
                                been speculation to the effect that, if war begins in Europe, the
                                Japanese will engage in acts of aggression against British and
                                French interests in China which may include seizure of some or all
                                areas where those powers now exercise administrative jurisdiction.
                                As against this, there came yesterday from the American Embassy at
                                Tokyo a telegram<note n="17" xml:id="d293fn17">Dated September 27, 9
                                    p.m., <ref target="#pg_298">p. 298</ref>.</note> giving the
                                Embassy’s estimate to the effect that Japan would probably, in the
                                event <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0307"/>of war beginning in
                                Europe, not precipitately embark upon activities aligning her with
                                Germany.</p>
                            <p>It is believed desirable that consideration be given to the question
                                of policy and action by this Government and its agencies in China,
                                in the event of war beginning in Europe, in regard to the American
                                landed armed forces at Tientsin and at Shanghai.</p>
                            <p>Press reports yesterday and today indicate that the British
                                Government has issued some instructions regarding and is making some
                                redistribution of the British armed forces, both those landed at
                                Chinese ports and their naval vessels operating in China waters. We
                                have no evidence of the British Government’s having informed us of
                                its intentions or consulted us in regard to these matters.</p>
                            <p>Although we have an informal understanding between the Department of
                                State and the British Foreign Office to the effect that if and as
                                either country is considering making alterations in the distribution
                                of its landed armed forces in China, it shall, if circumstances
                                permit, consult with or notify the other, it is believed that, in
                                the light of repeated omission on the part of the British Government
                                to consult or notify this Government, we would be warranted, if we
                                so chose, in proceeding as we may see fit with regard to possible
                                changes in the distribution of our landed armed forces, without
                                consulting or notifying the British Government. However, if and as
                                we make decisions in this matter, it will probably be possible for
                                us without inconvenience to consult with or notify the British
                                Government, and there might be advantage in our doing so.</p>
                            <p>It is believed that we need not concern ourselves here with the
                                question of possible movements of American naval vessels now at
                                Shanghai: Admiral Yarnell<note n="18" xml:id="d293fn18">Commander in
                                    Chief, United States Asiatic Meet.</note> can either make his
                                own decisions in that connection or ask the Navy Department for
                                instructions.</p>
                            <p>What need concern us is the matter of our Marine contingents at
                                Tientsin and at Shanghai, and possibly those at Peiping.</p>
                            <p>We have at present landed at Shanghai about 1300 Marines, officers
                                and men; at Tientsin about 250; and at Peiping about 250.</p>
                            <p>Since the readjustment made early in the current year in the
                                distribution of our landed armed forces in north China, at which
                                time we withdrew the 15th Infantry from Tientsin and transferred
                                from Peiping to Tientsin two companies of Marines, we have proceeded
                                on the theory that the Guard, consisting of two companies of Marines
                                at Peiping, and the two companies of Marines at Tientsin are
                                maintained at those points for the purpose of general policing, of
                                maintaining communications (especially through the operation of
                                radio stations), and to be of assistance to American nationals, in
                                the general capacity of an armed escort, in the event of there
                                arising a <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0308"/>situation calling
                                for withdrawing of American nationals from those cities and bringing
                                the said nationals to the coast or to some agreed-upon concentration
                                point. It is believed that we should continue for the time being to
                                maintain those forces at those points for those purposes. As the
                                situation unfolds, there may develop reason for reconsidering this
                                view. Any disturbance at this moment of the existing set-up as
                                regards the disposal of those forces would be premature and
                                gratuitously productive of alarm in the “foreign” communities at the
                                points under reference. It is especially desirable that our bases of
                                communication at Tientsin and Peiping continue in operation.</p>
                            <p>The Marine contingent which we now have landed at Shanghai is there
                                for the purpose of policing and, in particular, of guarding one
                                sector of the boundary of the International Settlement. It functions
                                in cooperation with similar landed armed forces of other countries,
                                especially Great Britain and Italy, and those of France, which guard
                                the outer boundaries of the French Concession (the inner boundary of
                                which is coincident with a part of the boundary of the International
                                Settlement). It is believed that this American Marine contingent
                                should be left where it is for the present, pending developments in
                                regard to disposal of the British and the French forces (and
                                possibly the Italian) at Shanghai. In the event of an impending
                                withdrawal of the British and/or the French forces, renewed
                                consideration should be immediately given by us to the question of
                                the disposal of our forces at Shanghai.</p>
                            <p>The one point with regard to which it is highly desirable that we
                                make a decision at this time is this: In the event of an authorized
                                movement by the Japanese toward seizing control of the International
                                Settlement at Shanghai, and if such movement were accompanied by
                                threat of or use of Japanese armed force, should our Marines
                                participate in any effort at armed resistance? It is believed that
                                the answer to this question should be in the negative. It stands to
                                reason that neither our landed force nor the landed forces of the
                                other powers, either separately or collectively, could hold their
                                positions against such armed forces as the Japanese could easily
                                employ for seizure and occupation of the Settlement. Resistance to
                                the point of combat could only result in a defeat, with its
                                accompaniment of large loss of life and extensive destruction of
                                property. If and when, in advance of a possible Japanese movement
                                toward occupation, the British and/or the French withdraw their
                                forces, we can then consider whether we will withdraw our force. In
                                the meantime, leaving our force where it is, we may advisedly come
                                to a decision that an attempt at seizure by the Japanese, if and
                                when, is to be resisted by diplomatic processes only, and not by
                                resort to force.</p>
                            <p>It is believed that the standing orders under which our landed armed
                                forces in China are operating, together with instructions which <pb
                                    n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0309"/>have been issued, in
                                explanation of policy, to State Department representatives in China,
                                for communication to the officers of the armed forces, together with
                                special instructions which have been issued by the Navy Department
                                from time to time, cover all contingencies which are likely to arise
                                except those referred to above, and that no special instruction or
                                orders need be sent at this time. If we can have a meeting of the
                                minds here to the effect that an authorized movement by Japanese
                                armed forces with the objective of seizing control of the Settlement
                                is not to be resisted by armed force, this Department and the Navy
                                Department would be prepared to act instantly in the event of there
                                arising need for instructions to be given on that point. There will
                                be time for the issuing of such instructions after evidence reaches
                                us of a Japanese intention so to act. To put on the cables or in the
                                air now an instruction to the effect suggested would be to take an
                                unnecessary chance of an interception by the Japanese the result of

                                that the Japanese Government is prepared to restore the northern

                            <p>2. Craigie has communicated this proposal to his Government with a
                                strong recommendation for acceptance. He feels that the large number
                                of Japanese residents in the northern Settlement area justifies the
                                Japanese conditions and believes that with regard to the transfer of
                                the District Court some reasonable compromise might be worked <pb

                                with the Renovation Government, He has told his Government that time
                                is of the essence in forestalling Japan’s complete tie up with
                                Germany and believes that to carry out this proposed compromise in
                                Shanghai would have a very favorable effect. He believes that the
                                proposal could be worked out without sacrificing any matter of
                                principle and certainly without involving any recognition of the
                                Renovation Government.</p>
                            <p>3. Craigie asks me to regard the foregoing as strictly confidential
                                and not to repeat this telegram to Shanghai because any risk of
                                publicity at present is to be avoided. The British Ambassador in
                                    Shanghai<note n="21" xml:id="d294fn21">Sir Archibald Clark

                                but Craigie believes that Clark Kerr does not appreciate the larger
                                issues involved. No reply has yet come from London to Craigie’s
                                recommendation.</p>
                            <p>4. I refrained from expressing an opinion as to the merits of the
                                Japanese proposal but said that I would pass it on to Washington in
                                strict confidence.</p>

                                    the Prime Minister was asked whether, as Minister for Foreign
                                    Affairs, he would continue the so-called “Ugaki–Craigie
                                    conversations” and he was quoted as replying that while the Vice
                                    Minister would normally conduct such interviews, he himself
                                    would receive the British Ambassador if the latter insisted, the
                                    press ascribing to Prince Konoye a distinctly condescending
                                    tone. Craigie has therefore asked the Foreign Office for a
                                    report as to precisely what the Minister did say.</item>

                                    take Canton prior to the final attack on Hankow and has reason
                                    to believe that the proposed move is being inspired by the
                                    Germans. The latter are reported to hold the opinion that the
                                    fall of Hankow will not in itself prove decisive in terminating
                                    the conflict; that Germany desires Japan to emerge from the
                                    conflict as still a strong power and therefore feels that every
                                    effort should be made to reach an early decision; and that the
                                    fall of Canton, by effectively cutting off Chiang Kai Shek from
                                    the outside world, would tend to hasten the successful

                                p.m. I had the honor to present our analysis of the attitude of
                                Japan with regard to the war which was then apparently impending in
                                Europe. I stated that there were reactionary elements among the
                                Japanese populace which were actively agitating for the giving of
                                military support by Japan to Germany, but I expressed the opinion
                                that the predominant feeling in this country was one of hope that
                                not only would Japan avoid becoming involved in any general
                                conflagration in Europe but that the calamity itself could be
                                prevented. When, as a result of the agreement reached at Munich by

                                immediate likelihood of war was removed, certain of my colleagues
                                believed that the predominant reaction of Japan to this development
                                was one of profound disappointment. Happily, there did not eventuate
                                that catastrophic conclusion to the prolonged efforts of the
                                statesmen of Europe to find a peaceful settlement of the issue
                                between Germany and Czechoslovakia which alone could have brought
                                forth an authoritative expression of the position of the Japanese
                                Government; and I fervently hope that there will never arise any
                                occasion or need for clarification <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308"
                                    facs="0312"/>of Japan’s position in this respect. However, as
                                the alignments among the nations of Europe and the tension between
                                the rival camps have not yet been entirely dissolved or relaxed, a
                                discussion of the question whether a general war in Europe would be
                                welcomed by Japan may be of something more than academic
                                interest.</p>
                            <p>In my telegram under reference, the first consideration on which was
                                based our conclusion that Japan desired for Europe a peaceful issue
                                out of all its difficulties is the policy which the Japanese
                                Government has consistently pursued since 1931, of withdrawal from
                                participation in the affairs of Europe. This consideration was
                                mentioned first for the reason that it has a fairly extended
                                historical background.</p>
                            <p>The inclusion of Japan among the Principal Allied and Associated
                                Powers in the war against the Central European Powers, which gave
                                Japan a voice in the settlement of a number of European problems of
                                not even the most remote concern to Japan, gratified the aspirations
                                of the Japanese people to be numbered among the great Powers. It was
                                flattering to be given a permanent seat in the Council of the League
                                of Nations and to have a voice in such matters as, for example, the
                                final disposition of Bessarabia. However, that outburst of
                                chauvinism and nationalism—the conflict with China in Manchuria—was
                                also a manifestation of a policy which had long been agitated in
                                Japan, of eliminating Occidental influences from the Far East. It
                                was obvious that practical considerations, notably the limited
                                economic and military resources of Japan, attached to the cry of
                                “East Asia for the Japanese” the corollary that Japan could not
                                undertake to oust European influence from the Far East and at the
                                same time continue to participate in the management of the affairs
                                of Europe, with all the risks and hazards which that involved.

                                of communism and in the following year associated herself also with

                                    respectively.</note> It is recalled that the Japanese Minister
                                for Foreign Affairs stated, with reference to the Convention with
                                Germany, that one of the purposes in concluding that agreement was
                                to open a way for Japan to escape from the isolation which
                                encompassed her and to proceed by gradual stages toward the
                                development of more friendly relations with the other great Powers.
                                It might therefore be reasonable to assume that Japan had found
                                occasion to regret her <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0313"
                                />withdrawal from Europe. However, it is unlikely that such an
                                assumption contains the whole truth or even a large portion of the
                                truth. There exists today as there has existed for some years past,
                                a section of the Japanese people which regrets, and even regrets
                                bitterly, the chain of events which began with the Japanese military
                                occupation of Manchuria in 1931, and which yearns for the “good old
                                days” when Japan was a member in good standing of the family of
                                nations. Nevertheless, even this element realizes that Japan will
                                not of its own accord retrace its steps, and that the road back
                                cannot be by way of the anti-Comintern Pact. Nor is there any
                                warrant whatever for assuming that the Army has any intention of
                                becoming embroiled in troubles in Europe under anything short of the
                                most compelling reasons. The fact that the economic dislocations
                                which would follow the outbreak of war in Europe was cited by us as
                                one of the reasons for Japanese hope that the crisis in Europe would
                                be successfully surmounted, may perhaps be queried by those who
                                remember that the World War brought about a period of unprecedented
                                prosperity in Japan. However, it must be remembered that Japan today
                                is not in the same position that she was in 1914 and subsequent
                                years. In 1914–18 the diversion of the industrial and economic
                                resources of Europe to the production of munitions and the
                                blockading of the Central European Powers resulted in a virtual
                                vacuum in world markets for manufactured articles. Whereas a large
                                part of the merchant marine of the combatants was either inactive or
                                engaged in the carrying of troops and munitions, the Japanese
                                merchant marine, which even in those days was of substantial size,
                                was left free for the development and expansion of Japan’s commerce.
                                The war was a god-sent hope which Japan exploited to the limits of
                                its resources, then unencumbered by the exigencies of the conduct of
                                military operations. Today, however, Japan is engaged in China in
                                hostilities over a front line of more than one thousand miles, she
                                has about 1,300,000 men under arms, her financial and economic
                                structure is being preserved only by recourse to trade, fiscal,
                                industrial and other control measures of the most drastic character,
                                while a substantial portion of her merchant shipping is being used
                                to munition her forces in China. In the unfavorable circumstances
                                existing today only an incorrigible optimist would believe that it
                                would be possible for Japan, were a general war to break out in
                                Europe, even to maintain her diminished export trade to a point
                                necessary for the purchase of the most essential commodities, to say
                                nothing of having the industrial and financial reserves essential
                                for replacement in world markets of goods which had thus far been
                                supplied by Europe. How, in these circumstances, it would be
                                possible for Japan to deprive herself completely, first of British
                                Empire markets and next of other markets beyond the effective sphere
                                of influence <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0314"/>of the
                                Japanese Navy, without there resulting a collapse of her economic
                                structure, it is difficult to see.</p>
                            <p>There is a third, and perhaps the most important, consideration of
                                all. When our telegram under reference was being prepared it was not
                                known that, along with ultranationalistic private organizations
                                which placarded the streets of Tokyo with demands that Japan take
                                advantage of war in Europe to move against Soviet Russia, a
                                substantial feeling existed in the Army that Japan should take
                                advantage of an opportunity which might never again occur to settle
                                once and for all its account with that country. Several responsible
                                Japanese officials have recently informed us in confidence that, if
                                a general war had broken out in Europe, it would have been
                                impossible for the Japanese Government to have continued
                                successfully to resist such demand; that with Japan allied with
                                Germany and possibly with Italy against Great Britain, France, and
                                Soviet Russia, the entry into the war of the United States on the
                                side of the democratic Powers would have been a virtual certainty;
                                and that with the United States also in arms against Japan there
                                could have been but one conclusion—and that a disastrous one for
                                Japan.</p>
                            <p>There no doubt exists among uneducated Japanese, and even among some
                                of those Japanese who are in a position to have an intelligent
                                perception of the situation, a feeling of disappointment that the
                                final conference at Munich did not prove abortive, and thus have
                                made it impossible for the democratic Powers of Europe, especially
                                Great Britain, to intervene forcibly in the Far East. Although a
                                conflagration in Europe would have given Japan a completely free
                                hand in China, I cannot believe that the trend of events involving
                                Japan which would have been started with inevitable certainty by a
                                war in Europe and which might well have ultimately concluded in the
                                collapse of the Japanese Empire, was not clearly apparent to those
                                elements and individuals who are now formulating the policies of
                                this country.</p>

                                Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs that it was not the desire of the
                                Japanese Government that there should prevail the belief that Japan
                                would necessarily give military support to Germany in the event of a
                                war in Europe.</p>

                            <p>165. Yesterday afternoon a Chinese, whose card indicated that he was
                                chief of the Bureau of Protocol of the Foreign Office of the
                                “Reformed Government,” called, this being the first call received by
                                this office from any official of that government. He said that Liang
                                Hung Chih, President of the Executive Yuan and head of the
                                government, would give a reception on October 10 at which foreigners
                                would be welcome. He added that he realized our Government had not
                                recognized the “Reformed Government” and that it would therefore be
                                difficult for me to attend in an official capacity, but he expressed
                                the hope that I could attend as a private individual. It seemed
                                evident from his conversation that he expected no foreign officials,
                                except Japanese, to attend, and as no statement from me was asked
                                for or seemed necessary I made none.</p>
                            <p>The general question of calls on and relations with officials of new
                                regimes is dealt with in telegrams between the Department and
                                Peiping, the most recent on record here being Peiping’s 125,
                                February 23, noon, and the Department’s 74, March 10, 4 p.m.,<note

                                question of attending functions does not appear to have been
                                definitely determined. I believe, however, that it would not be
                                advisable or necessary for me to attend the reception on October 10,
                                even in a private capacity, as the presence of an American official,
                                which would no doubt be reported in the local press, would be
                                regarded, at least by the general public, as an indication of
                                approval if not recognition of the new regime and would be bitterly
                                resented by Chinese here, apart from those connected with the new
                                regime. Unless otherwise instructed, I will not attend.</p>
                            <p>The British and German Consuls, the only other foreign officials now
                                in Nanking apart from the Japanese, received calls from the Chinese
                                above mentioned, but they do not propose to attend the function.</p>
                            <p>I also received a call yesterday from a Chinese, representing himself
                                to be a secretary in the new municipal government, who handed me the
                                new Mayor’s card. During the casual conversation with him I inquired
                                whether the Mayor’s office was busy, to which he made the
                                illuminating reply “oh, no, the Japanese do everything.”</p>
                            <p>Practically all officials of the “New Government” have now arrived in
                                Nanking and are busy establishing themselves in office quarters, <pb

                                the suitable buildings have already been taken over by various
                                Japanese organs. Furthermore, tenure is uncertain; the Foreign
                                Office, for example, which settled down some time ago in spacious
                                quarters, was unceremoniously ejected a few days ago by the Japanese
                                Special Service Section, which desired to use the premises, and has
                                been forced to remove to less suitable offices.</p>

                            <p>“May I point out, Mr. President, that, while your powerful appeals
                                have contributed so much to the appeasement of Europe, the resort to
                                brutal force and slaughter still prevail in the Far East and world
                                peace is still far from realization? I am confident that you, Mr.
                                President, who have already done so much in the past for peace,
                                surely will not ignore the problem of peace in the Far East. The
                                American Government whose mediation decades ago brought about the
                                termination of the Russo-Japanese War,<note n="30" xml:id="d298fn30"

                                certainly most closely concerned with the peace of the East.</p>
                            <p>“It is said that, owing to heavy human losses and economic
                                difficulties, Japan is beginning to realize that force solves no
                                problem. More than once she has sought mediation for peace by
                                Germany and Italy.</p>
                            <p>“But, Mr. President, my people feel that they can only look to your
                                Government for leadership in the active search for peace, because we
                                have complete faith that the kind of peace the American Government
                                is inspired to sponsor will be a just peace.</p>

                            <p>“Now that the European situation is settling down, may it not be
                                possible for the American Government to initiate a move for the
                                peace of the Far East by inviting all the Governments interested to
                                attend a Conference, stipulating a general cessation of hostilities
                                as a precondition and aiming at seeking a lasting settlement through
                                calm and fair-minded deliberation? May I not venture to suggest that
                                success in such a move would surely mean the crowning achievement of
                                the policy in the Far East with which your Government has identified
                                itself ever since the Washington Conference?</p>
                            <p>“I also wish to point out that the present moment seems to be the
                                most opportune time for such a move, because the Japanese are
                                engaged in a most difficult war for the attack and occupation of the
                                Wu-Han cities.”</p>

                                    prolonged resistance against Japan. To insure continuance of the

                                    the suppression of Communist China organizations and thorough

                                <item>We have substantial confirmation of the accuracy of our
                                    analysis of the official Japanese attitude toward war in Europe
                                    which seemed inevitable 2 weeks ago, and we believe that such
                                    attitude remains unchanged even though it is obvious that over
                                    the short haul such a war would give Japan freedom from European
                                    intervention in China. However, the apparent success with which

                                    appeasement is being noted here with concern. The possibility of
                                    the Far East being brought by the European powers within the
                                    compass of a plan for assuring a general peace is under
                                    discussion, one leading paper today suggesting the likelihood
                                    that a move with such end in view may be made by Britain and

                                    but tendentious or otherwise unreliable news with regard to
                                    European developments makes it difficult for us to place in
                                    accurate perspective Japanese discussions of the nature above
                                    indicated. As stated in my previous telegram on this subject,
                                    Japan would have preferred to a European war the continuation in
                                    that area of conditions of unrest and alarm. We assume that,
                                    whereas the trend in Europe is definitely favorable, progress
                                    has not yet been made to a point where definite thought is being
                                    given to the Far East. If that assumption is correct, Japanese
                                    anticipation at this early date of possible European
                                    intervention in the Far East would appear to betray absence of
                                    confidence in continued support from Fascist countries and a
                                    state of nervousness over the future hitherto not apparent. It
                                    may be significant in this connection that much prominence is
                                    being given to reported assurances received from Poland and Peru

                                is being brought to bear on the Japanese Government to conclude
                                actual alliances with Germany and Italy. If this were done, the move
                                could only be interpreted as hostile to Great Britain and as
                                dividing the world still further into hostile camps. So long as the
                                pact was aimed exclusively against the Comintern, Great Britain
                                could have no good grounds for protests, but formal alliances with
                                the totalitarian states would be quite a different matter. Craigie
                                elaborated on the unfortunate effect which such alliances would
                                exert on the current efforts to ensure peace in Europe.</p>
                            <p>It was noticeable that Horinouchi made no denial of the report.
                                Craigie believes that the German Ambassador returned from Berlin in
                                the summer with definite instructions to strengthen the
                                Anti-Comintern Pact and that he is bringing steady pressure to bear
                                on the Japanese Government.</p>

                                    not under Japanese control. Whereas such supplies are also being
                                    received from Indo-China and Russia, the quantities are probably
                                    not large when compared with the volume received over the
                                    Hankow-Kowloon line and probably insufficient to meet Chinese

                                    Command had satisfied itself that the main Chinese forces intend
                                    to retreat from Hankow to the south and southwest. This would be
                                    a rational course for the Chinese to follow, as the five
                                    southwest provinces must hereafter provide the greater part of
                                    the resources of money, personnel and material for continued
                                    resistance. In view of these considerations, an advance along
                                    the railway toward Hankow is probably contemplated.</item>

                            <p>1751. The Chief of the Far Eastern Division at the Foreign
                                    Office<note n="38" xml:id="d305fn38">Henri Hoppenot.</note> said
                                to me this afternoon that the Japanese invasion of South China which
                                has begun with the landing of troops at Bias Bay had been under
                                consideration by the Japanese authorities for a long time. The
                                Japanese Navy had always wanted to take this action but the Foreign
                                Office had opposed it for fear of complications with foreign powers.
                                With the fall of Ugaki<note n="39" xml:id="d305fn39">Foreign
                                    Minister Ugaki resigned September 30.</note> and decline of
                                Foreign Office influence, the navy view had prevailed.</p>
                            <p>Hoppenot believed the first Japanese objective will be to cut the
                                railway in the section north of Kowloon and that for this purpose
                                troops will be landed on the east bank of the Canton River in
                                addition to those landed at Bias Bay. After this has been done he
                                expects the Japanese to attack Canton but believes that in order to
                                avoid the difficulties of an approach overland through the mountain
                                and lake regions the Japanese will move troops on junks up the
                                Canton River. He said that the force of some 35,000 men already
                                landed at Bias Bay should be sufficient to cut the railway. A
                                considerably larger force will be needed to capture Canton although
                                his information indicates that the Chinese military at Canton are
                                lukewarm about putting up a strong defense and that recently the
                                best troops which had been stationed there have been moved to the
                                north.</p>
                            <p>He believes that the Japanese intend to set up an autonomous
                                government in Kwangtung and that while they will be able to
                                accomplish <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0323"/>their objectives
                                in this area, including cutting off of supplies going to Hankow from
                                Hong Kong, this will have little effect upon the ultimate outcome of
                                the conflict.</p>
                            <p>Hoppenot said that he did not like the looks of things. The Japanese
                                are becoming “excited” and unpleasant in conversations in Tokyo
                                between the Foreign Office and the French Embassy and between the
                                Japanese Embassy and the Foreign Office here. The Japanese Embassy
                                had protested because a few Chinese officers and soldiers in mufti
                                had been allowed to cross Tonkin going from Kwangsi to Yunnan. The
                                French Foreign Office had replied that they could not prohibit
                                Chinese transiting Tonkin, that a few Chinese soldiers in civilian
                                attire could not be distinguished from ordinary civilians and that
                                in any case there was no declared war and France had no obligation
                                to prohibit even Chinese troops from crossing Indo-China. The
                                Japanese Embassy, however, maintained its point of view and insisted
                                that the French should do something yeoman [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >regarding?</hi>] situation. Also the Japanese Counselor (the
                                Ambassador is quite ill) had lately protested a decree authorizing
                                the authorities in Indo-China to prohibit the export of iron ore and
                                manganese, Hoppenot had explained that this decree had been issued
                                only in order to permit the prohibition of exports if it should
                                appear in the future that these ores were needed in Indo-China and
                                had pointed out that the decree had not been applied and that Japan
                                was continuing to receive shipments of these ores. Japanese
                                Counselor nevertheless had insisted that Japan had the “right” to
                                obtain these ores and had been unpleasant about the matter.</p>
                            <p>Hoppenot stated that there was a clear relation between recent events
                                in Europe and the changing attitude of the Japanese. Throughout the
                                month of September it had seemed as if the Japanese attitude in the
                                Far East and the German attitude in Central Europe had been
                                synchronized. The British had noted this as well as the French.
                                Hoppenot expressed the opinion that the only hope of preventing the
                                situation in the Far East from steadily deteriorating would be for
                                the United States to express its views strongly to Japan on the
                                necessity of reasonable behaviour by the latter. I asked if he felt
                                that French interests were menaced by this new Japanese invasion. He
                                said that he feared there would be difficulties concerning the
                                French Concession at Canton and also that the Japanese might seize
                                Hainan. I asked what the French would do in this latter case. He
                                said that France would protest. France would certainly not go to war
                                with Japan over Hainan.</p>
                            <p>Hoppenot said that the Japanese had charged that shipments of war
                                material to China were continuing to pass over the French railway in
                                Indo-China. The French Government had replied that for <pb n="320"
                                    xml:id="pg_320" facs="0324"/>the past 2 months not a single
                                rifle had been carried on this railroad and had asked the Japanese
                                Government to produce facts to substantiate its charges. The
                                Japanese had insisted that shipments were going forward all the time
                                and that it would be beside the point to present detailed
                                information. I asked Hoppenot if it were really true that the French
                                were not letting any shipments of war material go over the railway
                                to Yunnan. Hoppenot said that this was absolutely true. I remarked
                                that this was bad luck for the Chinese. He said that it was indeed
                                bad luck but no matter how much the French might love the Chinese
                                they could not risk war with Japan on their account.</p>
                            <p>I asked if the Russians were increasing their shipments of war
                                materials to China. Hoppenot replied that they were. They also were
                                sending large numbers of aviation instructors as well as a number of
                                military experts to take the place of the German mission. With the
                                cutting of the Canton–Hankow Railway, the shipment of Russian war
                                material will have to be overland via Sinkiang since the Burma route
                                is not yet in condition.</p>

                            <p>From a reliable source it is learned that General Chiang Kai Shek is
                                increasingly exasperated with and contemptuous of Government and
                                Kuomintang officials. In the October 10 memorial service he
                                upbraided the attending dignitaries for being failures as officials
                                and even as men and declared that they were wholly unworthy of their
                                positions. The denunciation was unrelieved by any note of
                                encouragement much less commendation.</p>
                            <p>A non-partisan source stated that the Generalissimo has been
                                discovering ever since the Sian incident and especially during the
                                present crisis that many of his former enemies are serving his and
                                the nation’s interest better than the group surrounding him. Mainly
                                because of peculiarly Chinese ties of personal loyalty he does not
                                disencumber himself of this group. It is generally agreed that
                                despite Chiang’s commitment to prolonged resistance, the faction
                                desiring capitulation and peace is strong and not inarticulate. Chen
                                Li Fu day before yesterday frankly expressed himself as being in
                                favor of the Government coming to terms with the Japanese.</p>

                                Wuhan, it is reported that about 12,000 wounded a week are arriving
                                here. They are being steadily evacuated after preliminary

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. President</hi>: It has been eight and a half
                                months since I wrote you my last message. During all these months
                                Japanese aggression in China has not only not abated, but
                                methodically increased in magnitude and intensity. From across the
                                Great Wall, the Japanese invading forces have penetrated into the
                                Yellow River Basin and devastated the Yangtse Valley, and have now
                                started their campaign in South China. City after city has been
                                attacked, ransacked and reduced to ruins. Countless men, women and
                                children have lost their lives or become permanently disabled due to
                                utter disregard by the invader of the elementary rules of law and
                                humanity. Death missiles have been constantly rained from Japanese
                                aircraft on populous towns far remote from the area of actual
                                hostilities, even vehicles of civilian communication not being
                                spared. Poisonous gases have been invariably used as a last resort
                                by the Japanese forces whenever hard pressed by the Chinese
                                defender. As the conflict drags on, it becomes as clear as daylight
                                that Japan, though being gradually aware of her increasing
                                difficulties, is determined to use all the means at her disposal to
                                bring about complete conquest of China.</p>
                            <p>Despite their unprecedented suffering from Japan’s mediaeval
                                vandalism wrought with the ultra-modern weapons of war, the Chinese
                                people have shown exemplary courage and always kept up their morale.
                                This is attributable as much to their ever growing confidence of the
                                ultimate triumph of right over might as to the moral support we have
                                received from you and the people whom you represent. Your public
                                utterances and personal assurances have convinced us that you view
                                our momentous struggle in precisely the same light as we ourselves
                                do. Our victory over Japan means the re-assertion of law and order
                                among the nations. Our defeat by Japan means the complete breakdown
                                of peace and security in the whole Pacific as well as the <pb

                                principles of international relations for which the United States
                                and the other peace-loving countries stand. It is undoubtedly
                                considerations like these that have led you to make repeated
                                warnings to the aggressor and show your deep sympathy for the
                                victims of aggression. Words of encouragement coupled with such
                                material help as the silver purchases have produced a most soothing
                                effect on the anguish and suffering of the Chinese people who
                                realize that China at this trying hour has not been forsaken at
                                least by the President of the United States.</p>
                            <p>On behalf of millions of our bleeding people I want to thank you once
                                more for all that you have done for our cause. May I at the same
                                time on behalf of these same people once more appeal to you to
                                render us yet greater assistance so as to ensure China’s success in
                                repelling Japanese aggression. Being in urgent need of the sinews of
                                resistance, we naturally look to the United States for such
                                financial and economic help as will enable us to carry on the
                                struggle to a successful end. A loan of a fairly large amount from
                                American sources will at once instill more confidence into our
                                people and make us resist Japan’s onslaught with greater force and
                                effect. I wish that the negotiations now going on in America toward
                                this end may with your blessing be brought to a successful
                                conclusion at an early date. I need not assure you, Mr. President,
                                that I shall feel most grateful to you for whatever effort you may
                                exert to increase China’s strength on the one hand and to awaken
                                Japan to the folly of her present policy on the other, thereby
                                bringing about a speedy restoration of peace in the Far East.</p>

                            <p>I have just talked with my Japanese colleague who assures me that the
                                Japanese forces are about to enter Pingwu on the Hong Kong–Canton
                                Railway. He also says that he thinks there is no intention of
                                landing strong Japanese forces from Pearl River in west Kwangtung
                                because forces from Bias Bay will easily reach Pearl River in a day
                                or so. He also has told me that he has by authorization of his
                                Government offered Hong Kong Government to arrange for Japanese
                                merchants in Formosa to supply this colony with vegetables and other
                                foodstuffs in case of shortage but that local government has not yet
                                accepted. He says Formosa has plenty of food supplies to spare. My
                                colleague telegraphed his Government at the request of Bishop of
                                Hong Kong and associated religious representatives for delimitation
                                of neutral zone for refugees along the railway just over the Hong
                                Kong frontier and has had “tacit consent” from Tokyo which he has
                                communicated to the Bishop here. My colleague very confidentially
                                says he knows that there are a number of influential Cantonese who
                                are willing to treat with the Japanese and that some approaches have
                                been made but certain individuals among them are not entirely
                                trusted and that accordingly no negotiations have been definitely
                                entered into.</p>

                                        views of the American Government concerning the safety of
                                        the rights and interests of third countries in a specified
                                        area at Hankow were set forth.</p>
                                    <p>In the above-mentioned <hi rend="italic">note verbale</hi>,
                                        the American Government urgently requested that the Japanese
                                        authorities so conduct their military operations in China as
                                        to avoid injury to the lives and property of American
                                        nationals. The fact that the Imperial military forces are
                                        already, to as great an extent as possible, strictly
                                        adhering to a policy of giving consideration to the safety
                                        of the lives and property of the nationals of third
                                        countries has previously been made clear by frequent
                                        communications and public statements by the Japanese
                                        Government, and has been substantiated by past examples.
                                        Accordingly, even if a lack of concurrence and cooperation
                                        on the part of the Chinese authorities should unhappily
                                        prevent the implementation of the arrangement between the
                                        Japanese Government and the powers concerned looking toward
                                        the safety of the lives and property of the nationals of
                                        third countries as a whole in a specified area in Hankow,
                                        there will be, of course, no change in the policy followed
                                        up to the present.</p>
                                    <p>When the Chinese military utilize the rights and interests of
                                        third countries for military operations, that is, when they
                                        offer military resistance from points in close proximity to
                                        such interests or use such interests as cover, it becomes
                                        practically impossible to avoid the occurrence of unforeseen
                                        damage to the rights and interests of third countries.
                                        Nevertheless, according to reports from all sources, the
                                        Chinese military are utilizing the rights and interests of
                                        third countries, within and without the area in question,
                                        they are building military emplacements, and they are
                                        storing arms, ammunitions, military supplies, et cetera. It
                                        is important that the powers concerned, if they are desirous
                                        of securing the safety of those interests, should take
                                        effective and appropriate measures to prevent acts of the
                                        Chinese forces which can be anticipated to jeopardize or
                                        injure such rights and interests. If, on the contrary,
                                        measures which should appropriately be taken are not taken,
                                        and the powers concerned demand of the Japanese Government
                                        alone satisfaction in regard to the results of damages to
                                        rights and interests, such demands cannot be said to be
                                        just. For this reason the Imperial Government must continue
                                        to hold the view, as set forth in its <hi rend="italic">note
                                            verbale</hi> dated September 3, 1938, that in such
                                        circumstances the Japanese Government cannot assume

                                Japanese over central silver to the value of about 40,000,000
                                Chinese dollars in a Chinese bank in the French Concession and about
                                $14,000,000 in a Chinese bank in the British Concession. British
                                Embassy understands that the chief concern of the Japanese is that
                                the silver may be shipped out of the port. British Embassy is
                                contemplating a suggestion that the silver stocks in question should
                                be placed under seal with the concurrence of the Chinese banks and
                                the Japanese and the matter thus disposed of for the time being.
                                Before proposing this solution, however, the British Embassy
                                inquires whether the American Government is perhaps interested in
                                this silver or its possible purchase, it being indicated that such
                                interest might affect a decision as to making the proposal above
                                outlined. I stated that I had no information but would inquire. What

                            <p>The situation in the Far East has been and continues to be a subject
                                to which I give close attention and a great deal of thought. The
                                need for a solution of the tragic conflict which has arisen in the
                                Far East through pacific negotiation, on a basis of justice and
                                neither through the exercise of force nor under the threat of the
                                exercise of force, is daily becoming more imperative in the interest
                                of the re-establishment of the reign of law and order in the world.
                                I am profoundly hopeful that in this manner adjustments and
                                settlements may be found in the Far East which will remove causes of
                                conflict, conform to the standards of real equity, and thus
                                contribute effectively to the cause of peace.</p>
                            <p>You may rest assured that if in my opinion an appropriate opportunity
                                is presented for me to assist in the furtherance of these
                                objectives, I shall gladly avail myself of the occasion.</p>

                                which were the subject of General Chiang’s communication and that he
                                was observing every development with a desire so to act as to
                                contribute, while safeguarding the interests of the United States,
                                toward an alleviation of the distress, destruction and suffering,
                                which are inherent in and produced by the Chinese-Japanese
                                hostilities. The Ambassador said that he well understood that the
                                President could not make any commitment at this time; and, in the
                                brief conversation which ensued, the Ambassador made it clear that
                                he entertained no thought that a mediation undertaken at this time
                                could be conducive to any settlement other than one in which China
                                would come off badly.</p>

                                talked with the Department along similar lines.</p>
                            <p>I asked Koo if he really believed a <hi rend="italic">démarche</hi>
                                such as he suggests could be effective in persuading the Japanese
                                Navy and Military to withdraw from this South China invasion in
                                which their prestige is engaged. He admitted that it was a bit late
                                but asserted his belief that an unmistakable indication by the three
                                governments that they would stop furnishing Japan military supplies
                                and raw materials needed for her armament industry, unless the South
                                China adventure is abandoned, would be effective.</p>

                                authorization from the Secretary, I telephoned Mr. Wayne Taylor of
                                the Treasury Department and told him that the Secretary felt that,
                                inasmuch as we have heretofore handled this matter orally, it would
                                be preferable to continue that procedure and to communicate to him
                                orally a statement of our attitude which he had requested yesterday
                                on behalf of the Secretary of the Treasury. I then said that we were
                                of the opinion that any move by this Government toward acquiring <pb
                                    n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0332"/>a property interest in the
                                silver in question under the circumstances now pertaining thereto
                                would be inadvisable. Mr. Taylor made note of this statement. I also
                                said that we proposed issuing an instruction to the American Consul
                                General at Shanghai asking the Consul General to inform the British
                                Embassy orally and informally, in response to its inquiry, that he
                                had no comment to make other than to say that he understood that the
                                silver in question was not specifically included in any arrangement
                                now in effect between the Chinese and American Governments. I asked
                                Mr. Taylor whether that was a correct statement as to fact. He
                                replied in the affirmative. I said that we would not send off such a
                                telegram at once and that we would appreciate being informed that
                                the Treasury Department had no objection to such a telegram.<note

                            <p>During the conversation I said that we of course assumed that so far
                                as the Chinese Government was concerned, the Chinese Government was
                                aware of the fact that if this silver should be delivered at some
                                American port the Treasury Department in all probability would be
                                prepared to purchase it. Mr. Taylor indicated that this assumption
                                was correct.<note n="52" xml:id="d315fn52">See also memorandum of

                            <p>507. Minister for Foreign Affairs<note n="53" xml:id="d316fn53">Wang
                                    Chung-hui.</note> asked me to see him yesterday the 20th and
                                after referring to Japanese organization of South China stated that
                                he was anxious to know reaction of United States to this new
                                situation. I explained that I was unable to enlighten him as I had
                                no information bearing upon this question. Foreign Minister then
                                said that Chinese Government, when inquiring at London, Paris and
                                Moscow, had been told by those powers that they were waiting upon
                                initiative by the United States before giving assistance to China in
                                the present situation. He said that the Government and people of
                                China hoped that the United States would take the initiative in
                                assisting the Chinese to continue resistance to the Japanese either
                                by refusing supplies to the Japanese or by financial assistance to
                                the Chinese or, failing such positive acts of assistance they hoped
                                that the American <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0333"
                                />Government would take the initiative and concert with the powers
                                to bring about peace in the Pacific. He referred with appreciation
                                to the fact that the Government of the United States had already
                                done something in that it had expressed its disapproval of sales of
                                planes to Japan by American plane manufacturers, which he said had
                                had an effect. He hoped we might go farther and similarly disapprove
                                supplies of petroleum products and similar supplies.</p>
                            <p>I remarked that I would be happy to communicate his message to you,
                                that I was not informed as to all measures that the American
                                Government might be able to take within the limits of law. I
                                expressed my conviction that these matters had been thoroughly
                                canvassed by the leaders of the administration and my belief that
                                when this present message came before them there would be found to
                                exist a feeling that the American Government had perhaps done more
                                than any other single power in giving positive assistance to the
                                Chinese Government through its purchase of Chinese silver thereby
                                enabling the Chinese Government to stabilize its currency and
                                maintain it among the currencies of the world. Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs admitted this and expressed gratitude of the Chinese
                                Government and people. He again said that something more was needed
                                now if China was to continue its resistance of [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >or</hi>] if an honorable peace was to be made. With reference
                                to the establishment of peace I said that the American Government
                                was anxious to see peace reestablished, that we had canvassed the
                                subject of good offices which was previously brought up by the
                                Minister (see my 376, July 27, 2 p.m.) and that as a result we had
                                come to the conclusion that the leaders of the Japanese military
                                were not ready to receive or entertain proposals which would be
                                acceptable to the Chinese. I said, however, that I would communicate
                                the purport of our conversation to you and that I would communicate
                                to him any message that you might care to send.</p>

                            <p>2. American observers report looting by Chinese in Canton last night
                                and today. Destruction of utilities by the Chinese continues and
                                last night Wongsha, the Canton terminal of the Canton–Hankow
                                Railway, was burned with many of the buildings in the vicinity. Much
                                of the defense apparatus, anti-aircraft guns, et cetera, have been
                                taken out of the city by the retiring local forces and no guns are
                                being <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0334"/>fired at the Japanese
                                planes which are flying over the city observing and dropping
                                leaflets, two of which are addressed to Commander-in-Chief Yu Han
                                Mou, Governor Wu Te Chen and Mayor Tseng Yang Fu, one stating that
                                the Japanese forces have complete command of the air and the eastern
                                part of Kwangtung and urging these three as men of talents to
                                cooperate with the Japanese to establish eternal peace in East Asia
                                and save the people of Kwangtung from terrible sufferings. The
                                second pamphlet says that Canton now being enveloped by a powerful
                                Japanese Army, the entire city of Canton will be converted into
                                scorched land within a couple of days by which time the political
                                and economic development as well as the public buildings and
                                frontier will with certainty be destroyed and asks, why do you
                                gentlemen do nothing to save the innocent people.</p>

                            <p>1. (1) Responsible military officials make in private conversation no
                                suggestion that with the fall of Wuhan there will be on their part
                                any thought of capitulation to Japan.</p>
                            <p>(2) They observe that the Japanese have identified the capture of
                                Wuhan with the destruction of Chiang Kai Shek’s military power, but
                                now that the main Chinese force is being withdrawn from Wuhan area
                                they anticipate a reorientation in Japanese campaign plans. The
                                Japanese are not expected to repeat the Nanking error of
                                concentrating their major effort upon the occupation of the capital
                                and then with its seizure relax their military operations, thus
                                giving the Chinese an opportunity to rally. It is suggested that the
                                drive on Wuhan is now secondary to the campaign directed at the
                                Chinese forces evading the envelopment of this center. The offensive
                                on Sien-ning is expected to turn southward on the Canton–Hankow
                                Railway, that in the Sinyang sector to proceed northward and
                                westward.</p>
                            <p>(3) It is recognized, however, that, because the Japanese have
                                identified the capture of Wuhan with the destruction of Chiang Kai
                                Shek’s military power, they may thereby be deflected from a
                                determined pursuit of the retreating Chinese.</p>
                            <p>(4) Six hundred Kuomintang Youth Corps members trained to organize
                                guerrillas have recently been sent behind the Japanese lines in the
                                Yangtze Valley. Central Government authorities behind the Japanese
                                lines are also training local youth for such work. Communist
                                organizers are now active in every Japanese occupied province. <pb
                                    n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0335"/>The Eighth Route Army has
                                sent 60 of these young men to work in South Manchuria. However, the
                                military effectiveness of partisan activities as now conducted is
                                over-emphasized by most foreign observers.</p>
                            <p>(5) A Central Government division has been ordered to a locality
                                north of Hopei, Anhwei; another is leaving the area east of Nanchang
                                for northeastern Kiangsi.</p>

                                this new Japanese action is a direct result of the capitulation of
                                the democratic powers to Japan’s “Anti-Commintern” allies in Europe
                                and that the resultant economic and strategic blow to Hong Kong is
                                further proof that Chamberlain’s policy is destructive to Britain’s
                                own interests since the threat to British possessions in the Far

                                contrary the Chinese will continue to defend their territory and
                                that widespread guerrilla warfare will prevent the Japanese from
                                consolidating their position in southern China as has proved the

                            <p>15. Japanese officers visited Shameen today and stated the Japanese
                                Army would not enter in force. Only a few of the principal centers
                                such as Civic Center, Government Headquarters, et cetera, would be
                                occupied. They demand that the telephone system be put in operation
                                as quickly as possible and I am endeavoring to arrange conferences
                                between Mr. Rhame of the China Electric Company which is managing
                                the Canton Telephone Administration and the Japanese proper

                                Blind in Fonggett about 600, at Lingnan University about 700. Today
                                it is intended to transfer 120 more across the river from the

                            <p>9. In the Communist daily <hi rend="italic">Hsin Hua Jih Pao</hi>
                                yesterday and today Chou En Lai editorially stated that Japan now
                                has demonstrated it <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0338"/>has a
                                new policy of expansion [of] the area of hostilities in China in an
                                effort to cut external and internal communications, isolate and
                                demoralize Chinese resistance and bring the conflict to an early
                                end. He anticipates Japanese occupation of all of the Canton–Hankow
                                and Pinghan lines and Lunghai to Sian.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese decision to extend hostilities to South China, Chou
                                declared, came largely as a result of the exhibition of British and
                                French attitude in the Czech crisis. He believed Japan hopes Britain
                                and France will in an attempt to salvage their interest in Far East
                                bring pressure on China to sacrifice herself through capitulation.
                                The application of the Chamberlain policy was a failure in Europe,
                                Chou maintains, and it is definitely not applicable to the Far East
                                because, firstly, China will not compromise with Japan and,
                                secondly, because interests are more patently affected in Far East
                                than [they] were in Central Europe.</p>
                            <p>In the face of the expanding Japanese invasion, Chou calls for
                                unwavering and protracted resistance, preparation for counter
                                offensive when the Japanese are fully extended, further development
                                of guerilla operations to rear of Japanese and organization of the
                                people for total warfare. China must convince the world, he
                                declared, that her defensive war is being fought with confidence in
                                an ultimate victory and that it will not be suspended before that
                                victory.</p>

                                clear all Chinese out of the buildings on Shakee Bund which have not

                                        but take the whole scope of military operations into

                                        having caused the enemy great losses, slowed down the pace

                                general opinion among the more conservative and best informed
                                contacts of this office in Hong Kong is that the rapidity and ease
                                of the Japanese invasion of South China and occupation of Canton was
                                mainly contributed to by the following factors: <pb n="338"

                                decisive one and there is now strong circumstantial evidence in Hong
                                Kong that the Cantonese have decided to encourage public emphasis
                                and proof of the bribery factor if for no other reason than that
                                they are deeply stung by persistent charges of military ineptitude
                                and lack of courage whereas their previous boasting has been
                                unceasingly to the contrary. This office concurs with most informed
                                local sources in a conviction that the South China leaders must have
                                known for months that a Japanese invasion was inevitable, even if
                                for no other reason than to cut the flow of munitions from Hong
                                Kong, and have been incredibly lax in failing to make at least
                                reasonably effective defense preparations for which they had
                                undoubted facilities.</p>

                            <p>514. Department’s 4, October 24, 7 p.m., to Hong Kong. It is my
                                belief that following factors account for rapidity of Japanese
                                invasion of Kwangtung. Excellent weather conditions which at this
                                time of year prevail at Bias Bay. Thus road and dry conditions of
                                rice fields making use of mechanized equipment possible. Japanese
                                landed in force well prepared accomplishing military surprise;
                                Chinese who were on inside of circle were apparently uncertain as to
                                point where blow would be delivered. Best Cantonese troops and
                                leaders were in Yangtze Valley. Local jealousy hampered Cantonese
                                leaders in preparing defense. Japanese had complete command of air
                                and were able to bomb also machine gun roads over which Chinese
                                forces were compelled to advance to meet invasion. Mechanized
                                equipment unhampered got ahead of infantry. I have not heard any
                                evidence to convince me of treachery on large scale sufficient to
                                account for what has happened. I believe stupidity and ineptitude of
                                Chinese leadership chiefly responsible.</p>

                            <p>19. Department’s October 24, 7 p.m. There are persistent rumors that
                                the Japanese troops were able to get through to Canton in the short
                                time it took them to do so by reason of the treachery of some
                                commanders of sections of the Chinese Army who did not place their
                                forces as ordered or did not make as strong a defense of their
                                positions as they might have done. Chinese officers attached to
                                headquarters admitted to me that several such officers were shot by
                                order of General Yu Han Mou during the fighting around Tamshui and
                                Waichow.</p>
                            <p>In my opinion a large factor in the defeat was the terrific
                                bombardment of the Chinese troops, [by?] heavy artillery,
                                bombardment from the air and machine gunning from armored tanks all
                                at the same time. It appears that most of the Kwangtung troops had
                                had little or no experience under fire and that their leadership was
                                weak. I talked with the major in command of a Chinese battalion
                                which was on October 20 attacked by airplanes and tanks
                                simultaneously about 20 miles from Canton. He says the battalion was
                                almost completely wiped out in a short time and the remnants
                                scattered throughout the countryside, the tanks unit involved came
                                in Canton the next day as reported in my telegram October 21, 6

                                yet come to Canton, the commanding officer Lieutenant General
                                Furusho is still in Tsengcheng. No news has reached Canton as to
                                present disposition of either Chinese or Japanese troops but it is
                                believed that the former have fallen back across Canton–Hankow
                                Railway and gone toward northern Kwangtung.</p>
                            <p>The manner in which Canton was evacuated en masse in about 24 hours
                                together with statements made this office by Chinese leads me to
                                believe that this evacuation was decided upon some time before as a
                                policy to be carried out if the Japanese came near the city and
                                undoubtedly the police went from home [<hi rend="italic"
                                >house?</hi>] to house telling all the people that they must get out
                                at once as the town would be blown up and burned by the Chinese.</p>
                            <p>There is no indication whatever that the higher Chinese officials
                                civil or military went out [<hi rend="italic">over?</hi>]: on the
                                contrary, all indications are that they are loyal to China and
                                ordered scorched earth policy to be carried out on Canton to prevent
                                the Japanese from getting any good out of their occupation of
                                city.</p>

                            <p>20. Fires are still burning in various sections of Canton
                                particularly in the area around Silk Street and Blackwood Street,

                            <p>The Japanese have very few soldiers in Canton as yet, probably only
                                one regiment and are making little attempt to patrol whole city and
                                practically no attempt to put out fires or stop looting. Last night
                                they took over from British and French naval units the Shakee Bund
                                district and are today patrolling that. Observers report looting in
                                that area greatly increased since Japanese took charge. Americans in
                                Tungshan report that Japanese soldiers with Chinese coolies to carry
                                burdens are systematically breaking into houses in that part of the
                                city and carrying off loot in carts and motor trucks.</p>
                            <p>It is reported that there are many cases of rape by Japanese soldiers
                                in the villages south of Canton and many women and girls are fleeing
                                from those villages.</p>
                            <p>A few Chinese have been shot by Japanese soldiers for refusing to

                                demanding admission at the various gates. American sailors were

                                delivered to me your letter of August 30 in which you inform me of
                                the nature of <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0347"/>his visit to

                                convey cordial personal greetings to me. I recall with pleasure the
                                call which you made upon me last year and appreciate very much your
                                friendly message.</p>
                            <p>Since his arrival, Mr. Chen has been engaged in discussions with the
                                Treasury Department and I am sure that the matters brought forward
                                by him are receiving most careful and sympathetic consideration.</p>
                            <p>Your expression of gratitude for the humanitarian services which the
                                American people have rendered Chinese who have suffered as a result

                                that the friendly and mutually beneficial relations which have
                                always existed between China and the United States will through

                            <p>18. With further reference to the Department’s telegram of October
                                24, 7 p.m., Hong Kong English newspapers have since the start of the
                                Japanese invasion of South China commented editorially their
                                amazement and puzzlement over the unopposed Japanese advance and
                                have, with the exception of the <hi rend="italic">Hong Kong Daily

                                inclined to find an explanation in bribery or other factors
                                uncomplimentary to Chinese self-esteem. As indicative of a possible
                                change of thought and argument, which could be more inspired than
                                sincere, there is quoted the following excerpt from an editorial in
                                the usually quite independent <hi rend="italic">China Mail</hi> of

                                        surrender of Canton last week and the decision yesterday to
                                        refuse battle for the Wuhan cities there are obvious
                                        parallels: so striking that we may begin to wonder
                                        [whether?] first judgments have not done a grave injustice
                                        to Kwangtung’s military leaders. If it is fair to assume
                                        that the decision to abandon Hankow was based upon high
                                        policy and strategical considerations, it is not
                                        unreasonable to conjecture whether some of the reports which
                                        came through during the weekend, to the effect that General
                                        Yu Han Mou retired in direct obedience to orders <pb n="344"

                                        after all, contain more than a germ of truth. An objective
                                        study of China’s military problems must confirm this much:
                                        that nothing is really changed by the fall of Canton or
                                        Hankow, Japan having once entered upon the invasion of South
                                        China.”</p>

                            <p>21. No incidents arising out of the Japanese occupation of Wuhan and
                                involving Americans have thus far been reported. The Japanese troops

                                as in the refugee zone. By nightfall yesterday they were in full
                                possession of the ex-German Concession. They now have troops
                                billeted in the ex-Russian and ex-British Concessions. This morning
                                a large Japanese force marched through the former British
                                concession.</p>

                            <p>515. Department’s 360, October 25, noon, to Tokyo. It is my opinion
                                that the Munich Agreement came as a surprise to the Japanese who had
                                long planned an invasion of South China for the purpose of putting
                                an end to the stream of munitions that was flowing into China
                                through Hong Kong and Canton. I do not believe that it precipitated
                                that decision although Chinese reliance upon an assumed Japanese
                                unwillingness to affront British at Hong Kong contributed doubtless
                                to their failure to prepare for such an invasion and contributed to
                                ease which attended Japanese military advance. Nor do I feel that
                                Munich Agreement has necessarily contributed to increasing
                                truculency on the part of Japanese since this has existed from the
                                first. A review of Japanese military activities since beginning of
                                hostilities <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0349"/>will I think
                                justify one in believing that invasion of mainland is outward
                                manifestation of a revolt in Japan which has almost succeeded in
                                placing the Japanese military in control of the Government or at
                                least that part of Government which functions in regard to China and
                                the mainland. Resignation of Ugaki over proposed creation of China
                                Bureau independent of Foreign Office and therefore presaging the
                                establishment of Government for China independent of Japanese
                                relations with other nations and whole set of treaties regulating
                                those relations is measure of success of this revolt. Army’s
                                attitude from the beginning has been consistently opposed to
                                existence of national government in China and continuance of third
                                power rights, interest and influence in China. Japanese military
                                have successfully prevented shipment of American owned goods caught

                                national ships. Japanese Army in China and its leaders in Japan have
                                not, from the first, had any regard for treaties between Japan and
                                other powers or between China and third powers and by setting up in
                                Japan an independent bureau to deal with China affairs and
                                governments in China subordinate to Japanese Army control have
                                consigned such questions to that other Government of Japan with
                                which we have ordinary contact only through such recognized channels

                                with little or no opposition, but it did not give rise to this

                                    of the Munich Agreement and its aftermath on recent developments
                                    in the Far East, please review our 655, October 10, midnight.
                                    Subsequent developments in Europe have not borne out the hope,
                                    which was current when our telegram was sent, that stabilization
                                    of Europe was within close reach, yet it was precisely that
                                    possibility which aroused apprehension in this country lest the
                                    Munich Agreement Powers eventually intervene in the Far East. In
                                    fact it was suggested by the Japanese press that the Hankow
                                    offensive was being prosecuted with increased vigor in
                                    anticipation of such possible intervention. This connection
                                    between the Munich Agreement and events in the Far East was the
                                    only one which was given any notice whatever in Japan. The
                                    suggestion that the Munich Agreement had repercussions on
                                    Japanese policy the reverse of that above mentioned would be
                                    purely speculative.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>We believe that the Munich Agreement had no direct bearing on
                                    the attack on Canton. By reference to our 643, October 4, 4
                                    p.m., paragraph 4, it will be observed that my British colleague
                                    had already obtained knowledge of the preparations then being
                                    made for this attack, and, considering the elaborate precautions
                                    taken to preserve Japanese military secrets, it is highly
                                    probable that these preparations had been in hand for a
                                    substantial period of time (certainly <pb n="348"
                                        xml:id="pg_348" facs="0352"/>not less than 2 weeks) before
                                    Craigie got wind of them—and therefore before the Munich
                                    Conference was talked of. That the attack on Canton was a sound
                                    strategic move was so obvious that it had been expected for the
                                    past 12 months. An appraisal of the reasons for making the
                                    attack at the time actually chosen will be found in our 665,
                                    October 13, 5 p.m. However, we do not at all exclude as an
                                    additional reason for making the attack at this time the lack of
                                    British resoluteness disclosed during the protracted discussions

                                    Such expressions are of course completely contradictory of

                                <item>The advertisement of the Shiunso is only the most recent in a
                                    series directed against Great Britain during the past year by
                                    this organization. Two years ago the organization was
                                    preoccupied with Soviet Russia, and previously with American
                                    policy during the Manchurian conflict. The fact that its former
                                    threats have not been fulfilled should serve to place the
                                    fulminations of this organization in accurate perspective.
                                    Nevertheless, the extent and depth of the anger and resentment
                                    of the Japanese public against Great Britain should not be
                                    minimized. This feeling is no new development but has been
                                    vigorously manifested during the past year or more, as reported
                                    in several of our telegrams and despatches. Its existence has
                                    been frankly admitted to my British colleague on several

                                <item>As the Department is aware, my British colleague is convinced
                                    that the Germans are inciting the Japanese to take an
                                    increasingly uncompromising attitude vis-à-vis the British.
                                    Information which Japan derives from Germany with regard to
                                    British difficulties and involvements in Europe might, and
                                    probably does, affect the timing and extent of Japanese actions
                                    in China, but we do not believe that potential objectives of
                                    Japanese policy in China are capable of change one way or
                                    another by whatever advice or information Germany might

                                <item>Finally, in our analysis of the attitude of Japan towards
                                    foreign interests and foreign commercial activities in China, we
                                    should constantly bear in mind the fact that there exist marked
                                    discrepancies between the views of the home Government and of
                                    the military authorities in the field. We can hardly reject as
                                    diplomatic persiflage the assurances given us by such
                                    substantial statesmen as Prince Konoye (see our 640, October 3,
                                    4 p.m.,<note n="69" xml:id="d346fn69"><ref

                                            p. 53</ref>.</note> paragraph 3) who himself is a
                                    thorough Nationalist, even though these assurances are being
                                    daily belied in practice. The increasingly truculent attitude of
                                    the Japanese, mentioned by the Department, is of the Japanese
                                    military in the field, not of the home Government. In dealing
                                    with Japan we are, in effect, dealing with two distinct
                                    authorities who are sometimes very far apart in their respective
                                    conceptions of foreign policy. To us who live in Japan, this is
                                    a trite statement. Ironically, the military and naval
                                    authorities are having their day. Their obvious aim is to drive
                                    all commercial interests out of China and to make of China an
                                    exclusively Japanese mart. Into such vacuum as they are able to
                                    create, Japanese commercial and industrial interests will
                                    inevitably and progressively crowd. The home Government, which
                                    alone is able to appraise the international aspects of this
                                    situation, is for the moment very nearly powerless to compel the
                                    military authorities in the field to implement its
                                    assurances.</item>

                                Council October 28 and digest of message from Chiang Kai Shek in
                                which he made deductions encouraging to China from the Japanese
                                drive into South China which he asserted evidenced increasing
                                exhaustion and gave China military advantages. He said Chinese
                                Government policy had always been to reconstruct West China into
                                base for consolidation of national strength and that “the war has
                                been going as China had previously planned—not only have military
                                plans been completed but also political organizations have been
                                established in the areas under Japanese occupation”. He concluded by

                            <p>28. Further reference is made to the Department’s No. 4 of October
                                24, 7 p.m. and to my 19 of October 26. In possible explanation of
                                the seeming complete collapse of the Chinese defense in and around
                                Canton when the Japanese soldiers were still at a considerable
                                distance from the city, I would point out the essential
                                indefensibility of assistance solely by land forces against an enemy
                                having in addition to strong land forces and mechanized armament
                                complete command of the air and water.</p>
                            <p>The Chinese always realized that the Japanese could by combined land,
                                air and naval attack reduce the fortifications at Bocca Tigris and
                                that when this was accomplished Canton could be attacked by naval
                                vessels and guns from the Pearl River.</p>
                            <p>I believe therefore the complete abandonment of Canton, being a part
                                of the general policy of withdrawing to interior provinces at this
                                time and preparing to wage a long contest on guerrilla lines and
                                pursue the policy of forcing the Japanese to extend greatly their
                                lines of communication and wear themselves out financially and in
                                man power, was also decided upon to save Canton from an intensive
                                combined attack by land, water and air, which would have cost
                                countless lives if the people remained in the city.</p>
                            <p>Complete abandonment of the city and the great destruction wrought by
                                the Chinese on leaving was also a gesture of defiance and
                                determination to continue the struggle elsewhere. It was certainly
                                not a signal of surrender.</p>

                                hostilities for such a contingency as the present and withdraw into
                                Szechwan. He will of course be greatly handicapped in obtaining
                                supplies and will have to look to the overland route from Russia. He
                                is supposed however to have a considerable stock of munitions in
                                Szechwan.</p>
                            <p>Hoppenot states that if the Japanese were intelligent enough they
                                might now be able to bring about peace by offering such reasonable
                                terms that the Chinese could accept them without loss of face.
                                However, he believes that the Japanese will not be intelligent
                                enough to do this and that their terms will continue to be so harsh
                                that even if Chiang Kai Shek should remove himself from the picture
                                no Chinese leader could possibly accept them.</p>
                            <p>Hoppenot was much interested in our note to the Japanese Government
                                of October 6.<note n="70" xml:id="d349fn70"><ref

                                as he had seen excerpts in the press. He said that the French had
                                encountered the same types of discrimination in their trade in North
                                China and that the operation of exchange control in that area made
                                it impossible for the French to carry on business there. He said
                                that while our note was an able document he felt that the objective
                                which we had in mind might be achieved more effectively if we would
                                act in concert with the French and British in the Far East. He said
                                that in his judgment the only way that the Japanese can be brought
                                to behave more reasonably will be for the three great Western Powers
                                to set up something in the nature of a common front, not necessarily
                                by acting jointly but by concerting their action in such fashion as
                                to impress the Japanese with the fact that they are taking a common
                                stand in the protection of their interests.</p>
                            <p>He said that 2 days ago the Japanese Government through the Foreign
                                Office in Tokyo and the Embassy at Paris had repeated its protest
                                against the alleged continued passage of munitions over the railway
                                in Indo-China. See my 1751, October 13, 7 p.m. He said that the note
                                of the Japanese Embassy had been impertinent to the point of
                                insolence. The French reply must await Bonnet’s return from
                                Marseilles but it will be in strong terms stating that the Japanese
                                charges do not merit consideration in view of the formal French
                                assurances that the railway has been closed to munitions traffic and
                                due to the fact that the Japanese fail to adduce a single concrete
                                case supporting their charges. Hoppenot said that the railway had
                                been completely closed to the passage of munitions for over 2 months
                                and that even material ordered by China before the outbreak of
                                hostilities <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0356"/>was not allowed
                                passage. For instance, 10 airplanes ordered in May 1937 had arrived
                                in Indo-China recently; the French authorities had seized the planes
                                and cabled Paris that they were needed for the defense of the
                                Protectorate. Paris had approved. Hoppenot stated that the Japanese
                                through their spies knew very well what the true situation was and
                                he believes that the renewed protests in this particular were made
                                merely to hasten justification for military action which the
                                Japanese will take against either Hainan or the French railway in
                                Yunnan.</p>
                            <p>I asked if the Russians were increasing arms shipments to China.
                                Hoppenot said that his information was that they were not increasing
                                such shipments. He said that there had been reports from Hankow some
                                days before the capture of the city that the Russian Mission there
                                was not on very cordial terms with the Chinese authorities.</p>

                                gunboat <hi rend="italic">Cicala</hi> was specifically refused

                            <p>The new Japanese commander of <hi rend="italic">gendarmerie</hi> for
                                Canton, Colonel Hayashi, today informed the Consul General of Great
                                Britain that the Refugee Committee would not be permitted to take
                                from godowns at Fati any more of the rice which the bishopric of
                                Hong Kong had purchased on October 18th from Chinese merchants.
                                Colonel Hayashi said that the question of the ownership of this rice
                                had been referred to Tokyo and if it was found that title was
                                properly transferred to the bishopric at Hong Kong it would be paid
                                for but the rice was needed for the Japanese troops.</p>
                            <p>This decision makes the problem of obtaining food for the refugees
                                more precarious and it is understood that there is rice in the hands
                                of the Committee to feed the present number of refugees only about 2
                                weeks. The refugees are rapidly increasing in number as incidents of
                                shooting and rape occur in the villages and the women and children
                                come to the refugee camps.</p>
                            <p>It is believed that it will be necessary to buy rice in Hong Kong or
                                elsewhere outside China and bring it here soon. Arrangements to
                                safeguard the rice will of course have to be made with the Japanese
                                and more funds will be needed by the Refugee Committee to pay for
                                it.</p>

                                report the appointment on October 29 of Mr. Hachiro Arita as
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs in succession to Prince Konoye, the
                                Prime Minister, who also concurrently held the Ministry of Overseas
                                Affairs.</p>
                            <p>The selection at this time of Mr. Arita for the Foreign Office gives
                                no direct information on the question whether there is to be any
                                change, whether for better or for worse, in the future policy of
                                Japan toward the Western Powers. As for Japan’s China policy, that,
                                as has been so truthfully said recently by Japanese leaders, is
                                “immutable”. Mr. Arita is a thoroughly honest person and will not
                                compromise with his convictions; but one is never quite certain
                                whether the convictions which he holds today will last the morrow.
                                It is an open secret that, when Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, a
                                post which usually immediately precedes an ambassadorship, he chose
                                to go as Minister to Austria in preference to subscribing to
                                Japanese policy in Manchuria. Since then, he has gained the
                                confidence of the Army, and he returns to the Foreign Office to
                                support a policy in comparison to which the Manchuria policy was
                                child’s play. Presumably he, like most liberal Japanese, realizes
                                that for Japan there is no road back.</p>
                            <p>Most Japanese observers were of the opinion that when the decision
                                was taken against the opposition of General Ugaki to set up the
                                China Organ, it would be extremely difficult if not impossible to
                                find a senior diplomatist prepared to associate himself with that
                                decision as a condition precedent to appointment to the Foreign
                                Office; for to give assent would be tantamount to acquiescence in
                                transferring the direction of Japan’s relations with the Powers as
                                well as with China from the Foreign Minister to the committee of
                                five cabinet <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0359"/>ministers who
                                are to be the governors of the China Organ. It might be said with a
                                certain amount of truth that the grant of wide powers to the China
                                Organ would merely regularize an existing practice; yet, the fact
                                remains that a Foreign Minister who has no power of initiative in
                                matters affecting foreign relations is not far from being an
                                anomaly. One fair assumption to be drawn from these circumstances is
                                that Mr. Arita, in consenting to be one of five persons who are
                                hereafter to direct foreign relations, has views on foreign policy
                                which do not materially differ from those of his future colleagues
                                on the board of governors of the China Organ.</p>
                            <p>The statement made by Mr. Arita on appointment and the speculations
                                of the press on the policy to be pursued now that Hankow has fallen
                                are not at all informative. The statement to be issued by the

                                clarify matters somewhat, but at the moment few persons outside the

                                sounds convincing.</p>
                            <p>During a call which the counselor of the Embassy<note n="74"
                                    xml:id="d353fn74">Eugene H. Dooman.</note> made on Mr.
                                Yoshizawa, Director of the American Bureau of the Foreign Office, he
                                inquired whether any progress was being made in drafting a reply to
                                my note of October 6, 1938,<note n="75" xml:id="d353fn75"><ref

                                            rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 785</ref>.</note> with
                                regard to American rights and interests in China. Mr. Yoshizawa said
                                that lantern processions were still being held to celebrate the
                                capture of Hankow and that, with a Minister just coming into office,
                                he had no idea when the reply would be ready. Mr. Dooman observed
                                that Japan had reached a fork in the road, and that she would have
                                to choose between giving full respect to the rights in China of the
                                United States and Great Britain, along with other Powers, and
                                returning to a condition of seclusion not unlike that which she
                                maintained for two hundred years under the Tokugawa Shogunate. He
                                believed that Japan’s well-being was bound up with cooperation with
                                the United States and Great Britain, and that, although she could
                                subsist on China, she could not expect to maintain even the present
                                Japanese standard of living. Mr. Yoshizawa said that even the
                                military had begun to realize that the industrial and economic
                                development by Japan of China would be impossible without the help
                                of American and British capital. Mr. Dooman replied that the grant
                                of loans by Americans should hardly be given serious thought so long
                                as the loans, if made, served only to maintain and perpetuate
                                conditions which excluded the principle of equality of opportunity.
                                Mr. Yoshizawa’s concluding remark was significant in the light of
                                our speculative appraisal of Mr. Arita’s views: it was that he saw
                                no solution of the issue with the United States over China <pb
                                    n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0360"/>unless the United States
                                were to recognize the new situation in the Far East.</p>
                            <p>With an important official statement on policy promised in two days,
                                further speculation at this time on the possibility of a change in
                                Japanese attitude would not seem to be called for. But long
                                experience with official statements issued by the Japanese
                                Government gives me no grounds to expect that we shall have a
                                clear-cut definition of Japanese attitude and objectives. If, as we
                                expect, the announcement will consist largely of generalities,
                                including the points enunciated by former Foreign Minister
                                Hirota—economic cooperation between Japan and China, joint
                                opposition to communism, and so on—a formula said to be much favored
                                by Mr. Arita, assurance of respect for foreign rights in China, and
                                emphasis on recognition by the Powers of the new situation in the
                                Far East, we shall be forced by subsequent events to interpret the
                                announcement as notice that there is to be no reversion by Japan to
                                the conditions contemplated by the Nine-Power Treaty. The jubilation
                                over the fall of Hankow and the confidence that dissention among the
                                Chinese leaders will develop in the near future, coupled with the
                                animosity toward Great Britain and to a less degree toward France,
                                dispose me to believe that, whatever the language of the promised
                                declaration of the Japanese Government may be, its intent will be to
                                affirm Japanese paramountcy in the Far East.</p>

                            <p>35. Conversations before the capture of Wuhan with sources close to
                                General Chiang Kai Shek have left the strong impression that the
                                Generalissimo genuinely believes that he is fighting not only in
                                defense of China but also on behalf of the democracies the vital
                                interests of which, he feels, will be affected by the expansion and
                                overweening ambitions of Japanese militarism. He is said to
                                appreciate the unwillingness of the democratic powers to take
                                military measures to check the expansion of Japanese militarism but
                                is bitterly disappointed in these states because of their continued
                                supply of war materials to Japan, which action he views as hostile
                                not only to China’s resistance but also as directly contrary to the
                                national interests of the democratic powers themselves.</p>
                            <p>Before the fall of Hankow and Canton competent foreign observers here
                                viewed China’s resistance to Japan as primarily a defense of <pb
                                    n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0361"/>Chinese sovereignty. They
                                now feel that China is unmistakably fighting not only her own battle
                                but, perforce, also that of the democracies. It is believed that the
                                stage may soon be reached where the Japanese military may be able to
                                convert the organizations of China now conquered into an economic
                                base for avowed further expansion. It is questioned whether Chinese
                                resistance, which will continue but in a weakened form, will be
                                sufficiently effective to prevent Japanese militarism from
                                exploiting at least those resources necessary for the aggrandizement
                                of its military power.</p>
                            <p>Economic restraints on Japan exerted by the United States and Great
                                Britain, these sources believe, can still check Japanese militarism
                                before it consolidates its position in China and launches further
                                adventures more closely affecting the democratic powers. It is
                                suggested that once Japanese militarism has begun to draw strength
                                from China’s resources the democracies may no longer, if confronted
                                with Japanese action jeopardizing their vital interests, be able to
                                choose the comfortable alternative of effective persuasion through
                                economic pressure.</p>

                            <p>3. A paraphrase of Craigie’s telegraphic report to London which was
                                sent some 10 days ago follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“Retaliation.</p>
                                    <p>The opinion has been reached, after careful consideration
                                        with the senior members of my staff, that no advantage would
                                        be gained by the gradual execution of a policy of reprisals
                                        working up from petty annoyances to denunciation but that
                                        the decision should first be made whether we are prepared to
                                        accept all the consequences of denunciation and if so
                                        prepared a denunciation <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi>
                                        should be made after fair warning to Japan. The merit of
                                        this course is that it is justifiable on the principle that
                                        most favored nation treatment cannot continually be accorded
                                        to a country which does not fulfill its treaty obligation
                                        (i. e. Nine Power Treaty), and thus it is consonant with the
                                        recent note of the United States.<note n="79"

                                    <p>I still stand by the view, however, with regard to the
                                        consequences of denunciation, that reaction would be very
                                        serious and I venture to express the view that the letter to
                                        the Departments of August 23rd somewhat underestimates the
                                        risks. As stated in paragraph 6 of that letter, I agree that
                                        the Japanese Government would be reluctant to add to their
                                        international complications but it is my opinion that in
                                        their present mood they might even take the risk of becoming
                                        embroiled with us if a step which would in effect be
                                        indistinguishable from sanctions were to be taken by us.
                                        Evidence of their present temper is the expedition to South
                                        China.</p>
                                    <p>I doubt, however, if there is necessity of running this risk.
                                        Since denunciation cannot come into effect for a year, no
                                        practical results can be expected before the beginning of
                                        1940. Although we cannot possibly say what the situation
                                        here will be then, the evidence before me makes it difficult
                                        to see whether China or Japan was nearer to financial
                                        exhaustion even before the Japanese expedition to South
                                        China. Since, by this expedition, the Japanese have so
                                        greatly extended their commitments, it is difficult to avoid
                                        the deduction that the pace at which Japanese resources must
                                        now steadily diminish will render unnecessary any effort on
                                        our part (at the sacrifice at best of friendship after the
                                        war) to hasten the end before 1940 at all events. At the
                                        same time as we continue to maintain our condemnation of
                                        Japan’s aggression and observe the terms of the League

                                        either when peace comes for making claims that the other has
                                        been unduly favored by us. I should prefer if my diagnosis
                                        is correct to put up with the temporary losses which British
                                        interests have suffered in China (many I understand have in
                                        fact not done so badly during the crisis) in order that
                                        during the peace negotiations and afterwards we may play our
                                        part. We can do this only if we do not leave a lasting
                                        grievance with the Japanese as we did with the

                            <p>701. My British colleague has handed me a copy of a letter dated
                                October 31, addressed by him to the Vice-Minister for Foreign
                                    Affairs,<note n="81" xml:id="d356fn81">Renzo Sawada.</note> of
                                which the following is a summary:</p>
                            <p>The British Ambassador points out that the British Parliament would
                                meet on November 1, and that he considers it of great importance to
                                the future of Anglo-Japanese relations that something should be done
                                at once to meet the British on at least some of the cases
                                outstanding. He says that the Foreign Office has asked him urgently
                                to report on the situation in view of the fact that when Parliament
                                meets the Ministers expect to be questioned closely in regard to the
                                fulfillment by the Japanese of the assurances so frequently given in
                                regard to the protection of British rights and interests in
                                China.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador states that with the best will in the world, he is
                                unable to return any other reply than that the Japanese Government
                                has failed so far to meet the British desiderata in any single
                                instance of importance. Referring to the fact that the Foreign
                                Office has a full list of cases in which a number have been injured,

                                    27, 3 p.m., from the Ambassador in Japan, <ref target="#pg_239"
                                        >p. 239</ref>.</note> the British Ambassador points out that
                                in spite of all his efforts to impress the Japanese Government with
                                the importance of these issues, the British have in fact received no
                                satisfaction whatever. He admits that in a number of relatively
                                minor cases (a list of which he encloses) British property has been
                                repaired and certain facilities given but he characterizes these as
                                “a mere islet in an ocean of discriminatory or unfair
                                treatment”.</p>
                            <p>Sir Robert then refers to the fact that the hope has been expressed

                                    Affairs, respectively.</note>—particularly as regards navigation
                                on the Yangtze—that the situation would be eased by the fall of
                                Hankow and inquires whether there is not a case here where it should
                                be possible for the Japanese Government to give immediate
                                satisfaction by opening up the river at least as far as Nanking. He
                                is seriously apprehensive as to the effect upon future
                                Anglo-Japanese relations if satisfaction is not given on this point
                                at the earliest possible moment.</p>
                            <p>The British Ambassador deprecates the thought that he is threatening
                                the Japanese Government with statements in Parliament in order <pb
                                    n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0364"/>to secure British
                                desiderata; on the contrary he feels sure that the British
                                Government will make every effort to mitigate the effects of any
                                official statements that may be made; but the facts cannot be
                                concealed from Parliament when questions of importance are asked. He
                                therefore repeats with the utmost emphasis that something concrete
                                should be done by the Japanese Government to enable the British
                                Government to say in Parliament that a satisfactory settlement has
                                been reached on this or that important issue.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion he states that he is holding up his reply to his
                                Foreign Office until he hears from the Vice-Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs and he wishes to know whether the Vice-Minister believes
                                there is any prospect of giving early satisfaction at least on the
                                Yangtze navigation issue.</p>
                            <p>Enclosed with the letter is a list of 10 minor cases where the
                                Japanese have evacuated British property and seven other cases which
                                have been settled involving the seizure of launches, [assault?]

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On various occasions during the course
                                of the present hostilities between Japan and China, I have discussed
                                in my telegrams and despatches the relations between Japan and Great
                                Britain as they have been affected by the hostilities. These
                                relations have received during the past two or three months renewed
                                attention on the part of the general public by reason of the
                                conversations which were initiated during the month of August by the
                                British Ambassador, Sir Robert Craigie, with the then Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs, General Ugaki. The failure of the Japanese
                                Government to respond favorably to the solicitations of the British
                                Government that Japan respect British rights and interests in China
                                has, paradoxical though it may be, resulted in exciting the press
                                and publicists to denouncing Great Britain in as unmeasured language
                                as though substantial concessions had been made to Great Britain.
                                The reasons adduced for this animosity against Great Britain, which
                                in most cases could be adduced with equal cogency against the United
                                States, do not explain why Great Britain has been singled out for
                                attack. There is now available a large volume of literature on this
                                subject, but as these writings generally conform to a certain
                                pattern, selections here and there may serve to give the Department
                                a general idea of the reasons which are presented for the present
                                animus against Great Britain.</p>
                            <p>There appears in the current issue of the magazine <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Japan and the Japanese</hi> an article by Dr. Oyama, who was at
                                one time Japanese consul general at San Francisco, arguing the need
                                for modification by Great Britain of its attitude toward Japan. He
                                contends that it is all very well for Great Britain to insist that
                                her rights and interests in China be respected, but that prior
                                consideration must be the enjoyment by Japan of absolute freedom to
                                carry on military operations in China. He states that Great Britain
                                has: <list>

                            <p>Typical of the more able and thoughtful articles is one contributed
                                to <hi rend="italic">Review Diplomatique</hi> by its editor, Dr.
                                Hanzawa. The writer, after citing the three points mentioned in the
                                article by Dr. Oyama as evidence of British animosity towards Japan
                                and of undue friendliness towards China, pronounces Britain’s
                                relations with China to be so close as virtually to constitute an
                                alliance. Dr. Hanzawa then presents several other reasons, which
                                probably suggest the real grounds for Japanese resentment against
                                Great Britain. He asks whether there is not need for Great Britain
                                to review its actions of the last twenty years against Japan. He
                                states that he finds no great difficulty in appreciating Great
                                Britain’s desire to promote peace, to establish a system of
                                collective security, and otherwise to promote the maintenance of the
                                    <hi rend="italic">status quo;</hi> but he insists that it has
                                been Great Britain which has been the ring-leader in promoting
                                various means, such as the Washington Conference treaties and the
                                London Naval Treaty, to bring pressure on Japan. He asks whether it
                                is not, after all, Great Britain which has been conducting a
                                worldwide campaign against Japanese commerce. He points out that it
                                was free trade which made possible the evolution of Great Britain
                                into a great commercial empire, and he asks whether it is compatible
                                for a nation which has everything to owe to free trade to attempt to
                                block Japanese commercial expansion in all parts of the world, but
                                more especially in China.</p>
                            <p>In this connection my attention was recently drawn to an article
                                which appeared in the London <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of
                                September 1, 1938, from its correspondent in Japan. It is the thesis
                                of the correspondent that the anti-British movement in Japan is one
                                manifestation of a revolt by the younger elements in the Army and
                                Navy and in the civil service against the older generation. He
                                states, “In its essence, however, it has become a struggle between
                                youthful dynamism in all departments of the national life and what
                                is called generally the elder clique, that capable, temperate, and
                                none too numerous oligarchy that has ruled Japan since her emergence
                                as a modern state.[”] The correspondent seems to refer in the
                                sentence quoted to the struggle which was described in my despatch
                                No. 2722, January 6, 1938<note n="86" xml:id="d358fn86"><ref

                                Western thought. It is, however, difficult to subscribe to the
                                correspondent’s thesis that the anti-British movement is primarily a
                                manifestation of that revolt (I say “primarily”, as the greater part
                                of his article is taken up with the development of this particular
                                thesis), for the reason that during the past thirty or forty years
                                the impact of the United States on Japan has been far greater than
                                that of Great Britain and American thought and tradition exercise
                                among the older generation as much influence as do <pb n="363"
                                    xml:id="pg_363" facs="0367"/>British thought and tradition. The
                                correspondent then ascribes as the secondary reason for the animus
                                against Great Britain the familiar contention that Great Britain has
                                been unduly helpful to China.</p>
                            <p>Even after reviewing the debate which wages back and forth between
                                British and Japanese organs of public opinion, one is still left
                                with the impression that the present state of feeling in Japan
                                against Great Britain is one of the political curiosities of the
                                moment. Quite apart from those factors which are being daily
                                stressed by the Japanese publicists, such as the supply of arms and
                                munitions by Great Britain to China, it seems to us that what has
                                contributed more to the present state of affairs than any other are,
                                first, the accumulation of Japanese grievances against Great Britain
                                which began with the termination of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and
                                concluded with the various measures taken by or at the instance of
                                the British Government to restrict Japanese trade, and second, the
                                consciousness that Great Britain is determined to remain permanently
                                a political and economic factor in the Far East.</p>
                            <p>Although my British colleague has not informed me that, in his
                                various conversations with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, there
                                was made clear to him the intention of the Japanese Government to
                                avoid a separate settlement of British complaints against Japanese
                                actions in China, I have been told by a well-informed Japanese that
                                there is no likelihood whatever of the Japanese Government being
                                prepared to discuss British grievances against Japan apart from
                                Japanese grievances against Great Britain which have been stored up
                                for a period of some years. It will have been noted from our
                                telegram No. 700, November 2, 6 p.m. that my British colleague had
                                reached the conclusion that from the longer viewpoint it would serve
                                British interests if effort were made by Great Britain to avoid
                                leaving Japan with a lasting grievance. However, it seems likely
                                that further interpretation, by action, of the official statement of
                                the Japanese Government published today, expressive of intent to
                                dominate the Far East, will effectively inhibit any expectation that
                                Anglo-Japanese relations can be guided in the near future into
                                smooth waters.</p>

                                popular sympathy shown throughout the United States for the <pb

                                desperate struggle for independence and against Japanese domination.
                                It would be useless to deny, however, that the Chinese are at a loss
                                to explain why this sympathy does not find expression in practical
                                form (1) by refusing to supply war essentials to Japan and (2) by
                                extending credits to China for such commodities. Thinking Chinese
                                would doubtless argue that self-interest alone would incline the
                                United States to refrain from assisting the Japanese Army to invade

                                    of Embassy in China.</note> November 3 inquired of Tsiang,
                                lately Chinese Ambassador in Moscow and now Director General of
                                Political Affairs of the Executive Yuan, what assistance was being
                                given by other countries and was told in confidence as follows:
                                France has sold the Chinese Government 2 lots of 30 military planes
                                each on 6 years credit. The planes are not entirely satisfactory
                                since on arrival parts were missing and during the crisis before the
                                Munich Agreement the Government of Indo-China temporarily detained
                                some planes for possible use by France. On the whole this
                                arrangement and the attitude of France are regarded as liberal and
                                friendly. Great Britain has not extended credit but has given great
                                assistance by permitting the passage of munitions through Hong Kong.
                                The capture of Canton having closed this route, the British are
                                continuing cooperation in establishing the Burma motor road which is
                                practically completed. He said that both this route and through
                                Indo-China are expensive, the cost per ton from the sea to Yunnanfu
                                being about Chinese dollars 1300 and 700 respectively or roughly
                                American dollars 200 and 100 but the Burma cost of 200 dollars may
                                in future be decreased by improvement in details of shipping.
                                Informant thought that the building of railways through Burma or
                                Chinese Turkestan had no practical bearing on present needs which
                                are urgent and immediate.</p>
                            <p>In connection with the non-aggression pact of August 1937, China
                                obtained from the Soviet Union an unconditioned credit of 1,000,000
                                Chinese dollars and in the following December a credit of
                                200,000,000 to be repaid in Chinese commodities without time limit.
                                China refused a Soviet request that China share its available
                                foreign exchange. This money has all been sent [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >spent?</hi>] by the Chinese Government. Informant thought
                                Stalin was invincibly opposed to military intervention on behalf of
                                China although Voroshilov and Blucher<note n="88" xml:id="d359fn88"
                                    >Soviet Commissar for Defense and Red Army Marshal,
                                    respectively, in the Soviet Far East.</note> are both thought to
                                advocate war against Japan. Germany has supplied China with
                                munitions through the medium of the first barter agreement <pb
                                    n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0369"/>and a second barter
                                agreement was concluded just before the capture of Canton which
                                event made the shipment of German goods into China almost
                                impossible. This second agreement is more liberal than the first in
                                that purchases may be negotiated with individual firms instead of
                                only with the German Government and the firms look to the German
                                Government for payment. Informant felt that the German attitude
                                toward this conflict is ambiguous but he discredits a rumor he
                                reported as coming from Europe to the effect that Germany has
                                extended a loan equivalent to 10,000,000 pounds to Japan with which
                                to purchase 1500 planes on the condition that Japan proceed to
                                attack the Soviet Union simultaneously with a German attack in
                                Europe. Italian aid to China has been negligible in value. Informant
                                made no mention of a refusal by any nation to supply to Japan
                                commodities it needs and he seemed fully conversant with the
                                economic conditions which would make it extremely difficult to
                                comply with the popular Chinese desire that the United States
                                curtail such exports. (Assistance given by the United States was not
                                discussed, otherwise the director would undoubtedly have
                                acknowledged gratefully the silver purchases as other informed
                                officials have done.)</p>
                            <p>Questioned in regard to the possibility of compromise with Japan,
                                Tsiang stated that of course the so-called Communist faction would
                                refuse short of victory to cease fighting the Japanese invasion but
                                he thought the general attitude of the representatives in the
                                People’s Political Council now meeting and probably of the country
                                at large was adequately expressed by a member of the “Youth
                                Movement” at the meeting of the second instant in saying that he
                                would give unquestioning obedience to Chiang Kai Shek whether the
                                latter decided for prolonged resistance or a compromise for peace.
                                Questioned whether he thought any terms of compromise could be
                                devised possible of acceptance by both sides, informant refrained
                                from discussing the matter beyond observing that such terms would be
                                very difficult to frame.</p>
                            <p>My inference from informant’s statements and other circumstances is
                                that it can hardly be believed that in practical matters any League

                                undermining China’s ability to resist. My opinion is the European
                                nations that have assisted China including Germany and Italy, which
                                did not join in the resolution, are convinced that the victory of
                                the Japanese Army would result in their partial or complete
                                exclusion from trade with China and that they privately would prefer
                                failure of the Japanese attempt to dominate China although their aid
                                to China is nicely proportioned to avoid provoking war with Japan.
                                Much less can I discern any initiative among them in practical
                                matters on behalf of the “more fundamental interest” of orderly

                            <p>2. For the past few weeks much attention has been given in the press
                                and elsewhere to the need for reformulation of Japanese policy in
                                the light of “the changed situation in the Far East” in order that
                                    (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the foreign powers might realize that
                                the future security of their interests in China is to be conditioned
                                upon their recognition of the “changed situation”; (<hi
                                    rend="italic">b</hi>) China be discouraged from assuming that
                                there is to be any relaxation of Japanese determination to eliminate
                                a government of China hostile to Japan; and (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >c</hi>) the need be emphasized to the Japanese people for
                                making sacrifices which the full development of Japanese policy will
                                entail. In our view the two statements, which might properly be
                                regarded as a single expression <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367"
                                    facs="0371"/>of Japanese policy, address in each of these three
                                directions a separate message. The Japanese people are told that the
                                war has only just begun and that they will be expected to make the
                                necessary sacrifices, an injunction which this Government pointed up
                                by a separate warning of the Minister of Finance that taxes are to
                                be increased. The Western Powers are warned that Japan will
                                cooperate with only those powers which “really understand” the
                                position of Japan and shape their policy “in accordance with the new
                                situation in East Asia”, while China is urged to abandon its leaders
                                and associate itself with Japan in the creation of a “new
                                order”.</p>
                            <p>3. The reference in the statements to future Japanese attitude toward
                                foreign powers must we believe be studied in the light of creditable
                                forecasts in several papers this morning of a further statement
                                which is reportedly to be made shortly by the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs, when he is to declare that “Japan can no longer acquiesce
                                in economic and political encroachments on China by the Western
                                Powers under the guise of the Open Door and other false principles
                                set out in the Nine Power Treaty, and that as Japan can no longer
                                conform to the Treaty it must be regarded as having lapsed”. (Note:
                                Necessary action by the Privy Council to permit of withdrawal from
                                that Treaty has not as yet been taken or so far as we know
                                requested.) One paper adds that the Japanese Government will state
                                in its reply to our note of October 6 that although “Japan has no
                                objection to the maintenance in the economic field of the principle
                                of the Open Door, it cannot admit demands regarding the principle
                                which in reality cloak political ambitions”. There is in the
                                foregoing press stories and elsewhere sufficient warrant for the
                                belief that the two statements issued yesterday are to be the first
                                of a series of overt moves by the Japanese Government seeking to
                                eliminate the Open Door as even a nominal guiding principle in the
                                regulation of foreign rights and interests in China. Unfortunately
                                the editorials this morning barely touch upon those portions of the
                                statements dealing with relations with third powers, but the brief
                                comment made tends to confirm the probable accuracy of our
                                analysis.</p>
                            <p>4. Some surprise along with much satisfaction is reflected in
                                editorials that it was preferred in these statements to address
                                China in terms more conciliatory than would have been the case if
                                there had been further emphasis on Japan’s determination not to
                                “deal with” the Chinese Government. Approval is given to the
                                stressing of the “rebirth of the Chinese Government” and of the
                                “creation of a new order”, as contrasted with the underscoring in
                                former statements of the “destruction of the Chinese Government” and
                                “surrender”. The conclusion is drawn by one or two papers that the
                                invitation to the Chinese people to reconstruct the Chinese
                                Government is clear notice <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0372"

                                        in regard to the situation in the Far East, the Secretary of
                                        State said that he felt it very important to view the
                                        situation in accurate and comprehensive perspective. The
                                        attitude of the United States and the position of the
                                        American Government in relations both with China and with
                                        Japan, as with other countries, are, he said, governed and
                                        guided by the generally accepted principles of international
                                        law, by the provisions of treaties to which the United
                                        States and numerous countries—among them China and Japan—are
                                        parties, and by principles of fair dealing and fair play
                                        between and among nations. This country’s position with
                                        regard to the situation in the Far East has, he said,
                                        repeatedly been declared, and this position remains
                                        unchanged”.</p>

                                and Wen Chung Yao made a speech.<note n="97" xml:id="d362fn97"

                            <p>A brief summary of the manifesto follows:</p>
                            <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0373"/>
                            <p>China has long been known as a righteous and cultured country, but
                                during the regime of Chiang Kai Shek military power was misused and
                                the people mistreated. Chiang united with the Communists to save
                                himself and then commenced war, which, combined with his “scorched
                                earth” policy, has resulted in great destruction of lives and
                                property. Canton and Hankow have now fallen but he still continues
                                upon one [<hi rend="italic">war?</hi>], disregarding the sacrifice
                                of the lives and property of his countrymen. Our country cannot be
                                saved unless Communists are exterminated, Communists cannot be
                                exterminated unless Chiang is overthrown, and peace cannot be
                                attained unless Communists are exterminated and Chiang is
                                overthrown. Peace depends upon our answer and we must arise and save
                                ourselves.</p>
                            <p>In a joint press interview yesterday Liang Hung Chih and Wang Keh Min
                                stated that: the general views of the conference are set forth in
                                the joint manifesto; we have three principal tasks, namely, to work
                                against communism, to overthrow Chiang, and to wake up our brothers
                                and struggle for the establishment of a new China; if we are to save
                                the country, we must overthrow Chiang and communism; the situation
                                of the new Central Government has not been settled in this
                                conference but will be taken up soon; relations will be established
                                with regimes in other places from which Chiang has been or will be
                                driven out; it is still too early to discuss definitely the
                                participation of Mongolia and Sinkiang in our conference. Questioned
                                as to possible peace plans, they replied “we must cultivate leading
                                persons who can maintain peace and order.” No definite statement was
                                made in regard to the date of the next conference.</p>
                            <p>It is believed here that the new Central Government, if and when
                                established, will be located in Nanking. Reports are current here
                                this new Central Government will be recognized by Japan,
                                “Manchukuo”, Germany and Italy, and that the new government will
                                request all powers concerned to give up extraterritorial rights and
                                withdraw troops from China.</p>
                            <p>Wang Keh Min and other Peiping delegates left today for Shanghai and
                                it is understood that they will fly to Peiping tomorrow.</p>
                            <p>Sent to Shanghai, and Peiping.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Truelle<note n="98" xml:id="d363fn98">French Counselor of
                                    Embassy.</note> called me on October 28 and said that his
                                Embassy had a telegram from the French Foreign Office stating that
                                the <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0374"/>Chinese Ambassador in

                                had stated to the Foreign Office that he and the Chinese Ambassadors
                                at Washington and at London<note n="1" xml:id="d363fn1">Hu Shih and
                                    Quo Tai-chi, respectively.</note> had instructions from their
                                Government to ask the respective foreign offices to consider making
                                a joint or common declaration to the Japanese Government that the
                                three Governments thus concerned would “oppose” Japanese operations
                                in south China. Mr. Truelle wished to know whether such an approach
                                had been made to this Department by the Chinese Embassy here.</p>
                            <p>I replied that no such approach had been made here. Mr. Truelle
                                expressed surprise. I stated that I was not surprised. There
                                followed some discussion of the matter, in the course of which I
                                repeated that no such approach had been made here and therefore no
                                consideration had been given here to any such suggestion.</p>
                            <p>This morning, November 5, the French Ambassador<note n="2"
                                    xml:id="d363fn2">Rene Doynel, Count de Saint-Quentin.</note>
                                asked for an appointment with me and stated that it was urgent. The
                                Ambassador then came to see me and stated that the Chinese
                                Ambassador in Paris was insistently telling the Foreign Office that
                                the Chinese Government had instructed its Ambassadors in Paris,
                                Washington and London to make the request mentioned above. His
                                Foreign Office wished to know whether this Government had yet been
                                approached by the Chinese Embassy in the sense indicated.</p>
                            <p>I replied that we had not been so approached. With the consent of the
                                Ambassador, I called Mr. Hamilton<note n="3" xml:id="d363fn3"
                                    >Maxwell M. Hamilton, Chief of the Division of Far Eastern
                                    Affairs.</note> in and put the inquiry before him. Mr. Hamilton
                                confirmed what I had said to Mr. Truelle and to the Ambassador. I
                                then asked the Ambassador whether his Government had ascertained
                                whether the Chinese Ambassador in London had made such an approach
                                to the British Government. The Ambassador replied that he was
                                uninformed on that subject. I said that it would seem reasonable to
                                assume that his Government would have made such an inquiry and that
                                it might be interesting both for the Ambassador and for us to know
                                what might have transpired in that connection. The Ambassador said
                                that he would inquire. I suggested that if and when he inquired he
                                should assume authorship of the inquiry and not attribute it to us,
                                as mine was an informal and unofficial suggestion and not a
                                suggestion of the Department.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hamilton referred to a conversation which the Chinese Minister
                                for Foreign Affairs<note n="4" xml:id="d363fn4">Wang
                                    Chung-hui.</note> had had sometime ago with the American
                                Ambassador in China in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs had
                                indicated an interest in ascertaining the reaction of the United
                                States to the south China invasion and in which the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0375"/>had made a
                                suggestion that there should be some common action by the American,
                                the British and the French Governments in regard to the general
                                situation in China and to observations in somewhat the same sense
                                that had been made by officers of the French Foreign Office to our
                                Chargé in Paris.<note n="5" xml:id="d363fn5">Edwin C. Wilson.</note>
                                At that point, Mr. Hamilton was called away. I thereafter said to
                                the Ambassador that, if the French Government, in having twice asked
                                whether we had been approached by the Chinese Ambassador, was
                                seeking to ascertain what might be our reaction to some proposal of
                                common or joint action, I would suggest that the Ambassador carry
                                the inquiry directly to the Under Secretary or the Secretary, as I
                                did not wish to venture into even a tentative discussion of that
                                point. The Ambassador replied that if he felt or found that such was
                                the intent of his Government he would so proceed.</p>
                            <p>With appropriate exchanges of amenities the conversation there
                                ended.</p>

                                General Kita, who went with them to Nanking, is also scheduled to
                                return.</p>
                            <p>According to several officials of the Provincial [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >Provisional</hi>] Government, the “National Conference”
                                reported by Nanking as scheduled to be held next month in that city
                                will have its counterpart in an assembly of “People’s Delegates”
                                here and perhaps other places. They state that out of these
                                gatherings will probably issue invitations to the Mengchiang regime
                                and new Canton and Hankow regimes to join the federation under the
                                United Council. It is not, however, possible to predict the exact
                                course such projected political developments will take, one reason
                                being that they are experimental in nature and depend for their
                                direction upon the outcome of rivalries among and maneuvers by
                                concerned Japanese and Chinese. One informant states that
                                    Doihara<note n="7" xml:id="d364fn7">Gen. Kenji Doihara.</note>
                                has returned here from Tokyo with approval for <pb n="372"
                                    xml:id="pg_372" facs="0376"/>his plan outlined in paragraph 2 of
                                the Embassy’s 650, November 1, 9 a.m., and if this proves to be true
                                a recasting of governmental personnel and framework will result.
                                Wang Keh Min is nevertheless expected to continue in some nominally
                                important post because of the curious fact that although Kita and
                                his other Japanese sponsors are reportedly tired of him because of
                                his stubbornness, his elimination would mean a political defeat for
                                them and victory for Doihara. As an example of Japanese difficulties
                                with him, an officer of this Embassy has been informed by a Chinese
                                official close to Wang that Generals Terauchi and Kita have for some
                                time been trying to persuade Wang to sign a document “transferring”
                                all North China railways to the Japanese in some form, such as an
                                “indemnity” to the Japanese Government for war expenditures in this
                                area or as a share in a development project in which nine-tenths of
                                the ownership and control would be Japanese and a nominal [one?]
                                tenth composed chiefly in financial returns would be Chinese. This
                                Wang has refused to do and, although he must conform to most of
                                their general and specific proposals in respect to the Government,
                                he is known to quarrel with them constantly over details and over
                                matters in which he sees some possibility of saving something for
                                the Chinese.</p>

                                ammunition sufficient for 6 months more of war on the present scale.
                                Other foreign and Chinese estimates are about 8 months. Domestic
                                production of rifle, mortar and machine gun ammunition and grenades
                                will presumably augment the supply but only meagerly.</p>

                                other countries in China. The Brussels Conference therefore had
                                considered the Far Eastern question more from the angle of what
                                could be done to maintain the integrity of China than from the point
                                of view of protection of their own rights in China. Today the
                                situation is vastly different. Since Brussels, Japan has
                                consistently acted contrary to her undertakings to respect the Open
                                Door and now the statements made last week in Tokyo leave no doubt
                                of the intention of the Japanese unless they are checked to create a
                                new situation in the Far East at the expense of the rights and
                                interests of other powers in that area. Hoppenot said that he
                                believed that unless the United States, Great Britain, and France
                                should take firm and concerted action to convince the Japanese that
                                they will not accept such unilateral revision of their rights in
                                China these three countries will find themselves in the early future
                                completely frozen out of China.</p>
                            <p>I asked Hoppenot along what lines he was thinking [of] attempting
                                action to convince the Japanese. He said that he was thinking about
                                as follows: that the three powers mentioned should, at approximately
                                the same time, let the Japanese Government know (secretly in order
                                    <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0379"/>that the Japanese need
                                not lose face) that they recognized that changes had taken place in
                                China since July 1937 and that this fact would have to be taken into
                                consideration in arriving at new agreements regarding the Far East.
                                However, the recognition of changes in the situation in the Far East
                                could not be imposed by Japan by unilateral action, and could only
                                become effective upon agreement of the powers signatories to the
                                Nine Power Treaty. Furthermore discussion of this question could not
                                take place until the present conflict in China had come to an end
                                whether this took 1 year or 2 years or longer, and of course a
                                government representing China would have to be a party to the
                                discussion. In the meanwhile the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>
                                regarding their rights in China must be maintained.</p>
                            <p>Hoppenot said that he believes that if something along the foregoing
                                lines could be conveyed firmly and secretly by Great Britain,
                                France, and the United States to Japan such action would prove
                                effective. He believes that a move of this nature would strengthen
                                the hands of Konoe, Arita and other civilian leaders.</p>
                            <p>As indicating that a firm stand with the Japanese proves effective,
                                Hoppenot referred to the matter of the Japanese protest against
                                alleged continuous passage of munitions over Indo-China (see my
                                1841, October 29, 1 p.m.). He said that the French reply to the
                                Japanese Embassy had been made on November 4 and had been in strong
                                terms refusing to take the Japanese protest into consideration.
                                (Incidentally he stated that the Japanese had proposed the despatch
                                of a Franco-Japanese commission to Indo-China to investigate the
                                situation on the spot; the French Government had of course turned
                                this down flatly.) Hoppenot then read me a Havas despatch just
                                received from Tokyo stating that the Domei Agency had announced that
                                the Japanese Government was now satisfied that there had been no
                                appreciable traffic in arms across Indo-China and that the
                                discussion with the French on this matter had taken place in a
                                manner entirely satisfactory to Japan.</p>

                                military and political situation and present peace talk. Situation
                                of National Government after loss of Hankow and Canton is of course
                                most precarious. Best informed foreign military opinion <pb n="376"
                                    xml:id="pg_376" facs="0380"/>is that Government cannot hope to
                                continue organized resistance on any effective scale for more than 6
                                months and doubt is expressed concerning effectiveness of guerrilla
                                activities. The Government cannot hope to renew supplies of
                                munitions or gasoline in adequate amounts after present supplies are
                                exhausted. However, I doubt whether there is a leader of the
                                National Government who could at present come to terms with the
                                Japanese on any basis satisfactory to the latter and command
                                sufficient prestige to carry the people with him. Such a peace, if
                                made, would leave the Japanese still under the necessity of
                                continuing hostilities on a fairly large scale and over a fairly
                                long period of time to disarm the people and restore order, so that
                                conditions under such a peace would not differ from conditions as
                                they are at present.</p>

                                your cabled message of October 15 in which you bring to my attention
                                the distressing circumstances and consequences of the conflict in
                                China and make reference to certain discussions now proceeding in
                                Washington.</p>
                            <p>For many years, I have, as you know, had a strong personal and
                                official interest in China. My official interest dates from the time
                                when I was Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and my personal
                                interest, which far antedates my official interest, stems from both
                                the early association of my forebears with the Far East and my long
                                affection for the Chinese people. As President my interest has
                                continued and during the past fifteen months the hardships and
                                suffering of your countrymen have aroused my deep sympathy and their
                                fortitude has inspired my admiration. The American people, I am
                                sure, share my interest and my feelings of sympathy and admiration.
                                These sentiments on our part have found expression in various types
                                of effort toward alleviating the sufferings of the Chinese people,
                                in support of principles which we believe should govern the efforts
                                of every nation in its relations with all others, and in
                                discouragement of practices not in harmony with those
                                principles.</p>
                            <p>The friendly feeling of the Chinese people and the American people
                                toward each other has been an important fact in international
                                relations, and that friendly feeling prevails and is vigorous
                                today.</p>
                            <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0381"/>
                            <p>With regard especially to the current conflict between China and
                                Japan, the American Government has repeatedly voiced its objection
                                to use of force in disregard of treaty rights and obligations and
                                has contended that with peace there must be coupled law and justice.
                                I am sure that you realize that, notwithstanding the strong
                                sympathies of this country and our desire that peace with justice
                                shall prevail in the Far East, action by the American Government
                                must conform to methods which are consistent with this country’s
                                laws, with the current opinion of our people, and with our estimate
                                of what is practicable.</p>
                            <p>With the views and considerations which I have briefly outlined above
                                in mind, I can assure you that with regard to the discussions in
                                Washington to which you refer, the matters brought forward are
                                receiving most careful and sympathetic consideration, and
                                furthermore that an early attainment of a just peace in the Far East
                                is and will continue to be my earnest hope.</p>

                                    (793.94/14360)</note></p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Japanese occupied Canton with two motives in mind. The first
                                    is the effect of such occupation upon China, and the second is
                                    the effect upon Great Britain. To strike at China is of
                                    secondary importance while to strike at Great Britain is of
                                    major importance. By occupying Canton, Japan only cuts the
                                    Canton–Hankow Railway and blockades the waterways, impeding
                                    transportation and stopping supplies of munitions. Canton, too,
                                    is an important base for nautical resistance, and Japan hopes by
                                    its occupation to break down the morale of the Chinese. However,
                                    the cost of landing and maintaining her forces there will not be
                                    compensated by the above results alone. But in striking a death
                                    blow at Britain’s historical prestige and traditional morale,
                                    she immeasurably enhances her own position and value. The
                                    present blow to Great Britain is not as great in effect as it
                                    will be in the future. Japan hopes that as Britain’s power and
                                    prestige suffer in South China, hers will rise proportionately
                                    in the eyes of the Chinese and all Asiatic peoples.</p>
                                <p>Thus she hopes to occupy completely the historical place formerly
                                    enjoyed by Great Britain during the last hundred years as the
                                    dominant factor in Far Eastern affairs.</p>
                                <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0382"/>
                                <p>By the successful occupation of Canton, Japan hopes that the old
                                    reliance of China upon Great Britain will now be abandoned in
                                    favor of Japan. Japan thinks that if she can break down British
                                    influence in South China she can break it down elsewhere. And
                                    the British Government and people may well ponder what the
                                    answer will be.</p>
                                <p>What I want to know is, ‘what will be Great Britain’s Far Eastern
                                    policy in view of this latest move on Japan’s part?’</p>
                                <p>Will Great Britain view the occupation of Canton in the same
                                    light as they view the occupation of Manchuria, North China and
                                    Shanghai?</p>
                                <p>Moreover what will Great Britain do in view of these latest
                                    developments?</p>
                                <p>I would like to have a definite answer to this question.</p>
                                <p>In view of the fact that Great Britain’s interests and prestige
                                    are threatened, will she quietly accept this <hi rend="italic"
                                        >fait accompli</hi> or will she demonstrate in no
                                    unmistakable terms her real intentions unequivocally, to
                                    safeguard her economic and political interests in the Far East,
                                    and above all to follow her historical policy of upholding high
                                    principles to which she has committed herself, or will she
                                    abandon these principles and sacrifice her standing?</p>
                                <p>China has been laboring lonehandedly for the past 16 months. We
                                    have looked to Great Britain and hoped for help, but up to the
                                    present we have received nothing tangible. We appreciate [the?]
                                    sending munitions through Hong Kong and upon a mutual[ly?]
                                    advantageous basis, but that avenue has now been closed.</p>
                                <p>As long as South China was not attacked we made allowances for
                                    Britain’s hesitancy to extend practical aid to this Government,
                                    now that Japan has cut off British trade there is no reason why
                                    Britain should hesitate to extend help to us.</p>
                                <p>As time goes on our people and the Chinese Army will become more
                                    and more disappointed in view of the absolute lack of concrete
                                    and tangible evidence of British support. And the advantage is
                                    something which the Chinese Government will be constrained to
                                    take into account.</p>
                                <p>I would like to know whether Great Britain will adhere to her
                                    obligation as a member of League of Nations, live up to her
                                    [historic?] and traditional standards and extend economic or
                                    some other practical help to China?</p>
                                <p>I would like to have this answered in a definite ‘yes’ or
                                    ‘no’.</p>
                                <p>For the past 16 months [we have been?] hearing a lot of eloquence
                                    about loans and in addition have been put off from time to time
                                    with excuses that loans were impossible because of Parliamentary
                                    complexities. But the whole world witnessed the granting almost
                                    overnight to Czechoslovakia of a loan similar in nature to that
                                    asked for by China.</p>
                                <p>Now the moment has come when we must have definite knowledge of
                                    Great Britain’s intentions.</p>
                                <p>If Great Britain [should go back?] alike upon us and her
                                    principles, then I shall never bring up this question again. Nor
                                    shall I ever mention anything concerning Great Britain’s Far
                                    Eastern policy. Nor shall I consult Great Britain as to China’s
                                    future policy or attitude, or anything concerning the Far
                                    East.</p>
                                <p>I can hardly believe, however, that an Empire which produced such
                                    statesmen as Dodson [<hi rend="italic">Disraeli?</hi>] and
                                    Gladstone could fail to see the <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379"
                                        facs="0383"/>significance of the repercussions of the
                                    occupation of Canton, and the inactivity of Great Britain upon
                                    her future in the whole of Asia.</p>
                                <p>This must be the, life of [<hi rend="italic">or?</hi>] the death
                                    turning point in British Far Eastern policy. Whether Britain
                                    extends aid to us or not, the British should realize that China
                                    today is unified as never before, and that we are determined to
                                    carry on prolonged resistance. Japan is unquestionably striving
                                    to have peace, on terms, however, not beneficial to Great
                                    Britain, and thus excluding her from Asiatic affairs, Japan
                                    would be willing to concede the gains she has acquired since
                                    hostilities began. If that question comes up, what is China’s
                                    answer going to be?</p>
                                <p>If Japan wins the war, the old and outstanding interests of Great
                                    Britain in China will be finished.</p>
                                <p>We must know what Great Britain’s answer is to be, because upon
                                    it depends the future policy of the Chinese Government. There
                                    are several roads open to us.</p>
                                <p>One thing that must be kept in view is that Japan, having
                                    occupied Canton, will probably occupy Hainan Island. What such a
                                    move will portend to Hong Kong can be left to the
                                    imagination.</p>
                                <p>In view of the importance of the questions raised in this
                                    conversation, will you kindly communicate immediately with the
                                    British Government and let me have a reply?”</p>

                                    xml:id="d372fn16">Capt. J. M. McHugh, U. S. M. C., Assistant
                                    Naval Attaché in China.</note> arrived here on November 15 in
                                company with the British Ambassador by car from Changsha where he
                                was present during Clark-Kerr’s conversation with Chiang Kai Shek on
                                November 4 and 5. Clark-Kerr went to Changsha to see Chiang in
                                response to a request made by the latter during their last meeting
                                at Hankow late in July. He did not go, as was generally suggested in
                                the press, to present Japanese peace proposals or to proffer Great
                                Britain’s good offices for a settlement of the present conflict.</p>
                            <p>McHugh had two very lengthy and frank conversations with Clark-Kerr
                                at Changsha on November 6 and 8 as well as daily contact with
                                    Donald<note n="17" xml:id="d372fn17">W. H. Donald, Australian

                                Donald on November 8. He is submitting a detailed written report
                                covering these conversations which includes a verbatim copy of the
                                    <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of the first conversation
                                between <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0384"/>Chiang Kai Shek and
                                Clark-Kerr on November 4. This document which is quoted verbatim in
                                my 546, November 16, 10 a.m. was made available to McHugh by Donald
                                after the former had obtained permission from the British Ambassador
                                to see it.</p>
                            <p>Clark-Kerr had expressed to McHugh a desire for a general talk the
                                night he arrived. This took place at noon the day after the above
                                meeting with Chiang but the arrival of other guests soon after the
                                talk opened forestalled McHugh’s intention to sound out Clark-Kerr
                                on the details of his interview. McHugh learned from Donald on the
                                following morning of the existence of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >aide-mémoire</hi> and the general tone of its contents, but
                                Donald stated he could not reveal it without Clark-Kerr’s
                                permission. McHugh then sought another interview with Clark-Kerr
                                that afternoon when the latter spoke to appropriate authorities of
                                the details of his conversation and gave permission for him to see
                                the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>.</p>
                            <p>McHugh gained the impression during this conversation as well as from
                                the document itself plus his talks with Donald that Chiang Kai Shek
                                had presented an ultimatum to London and he still believes that both
                                Donald and Madame Chiang hold this viewpoint. During his second
                                conversation with British Ambassador, however, which followed
                                McHugh’s lunch with Chiang, Clark-Kerr stated emphatically that
                                Chiang had not made his statements in the form of a threat. Instead
                                Chiang had asserted his desire to date signifies friendly relations
                                with the democratic powers; that he had confidently expected that
                                they, particularly Great Britain, were bound to come to the
                                assistance of China; but that the time had now arrived when he had
                                to have a specific statement of Britain’s intentions as well as
                                tangible evidence to present to the people of China at the
                                forthcoming plenary session of the Kuomintang which is scheduled to
                                take place in Chungking early in December. He suggested as an
                                initial move on Britain’s part a loan to support Chinese currency.
                                The British Ambassador informed McHugh that he had sent a subsequent
                                telegram himself to London after despatching the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >aide-mémoire</hi> to make clear that Chiang’s statements had
                                not conveyed any tone of belligerency or threat.</p>
                            <p>In his conversation on the 8th with Chiang Kai Shek, McHugh inquired
                                specifically if he were to be permitted to infer that the statements
                                made to the British Ambassador applied with equal force to the
                                United States. Chiang after a moment’s hesitation replied that he
                                thought that question should await an opportunity for him to confer
                                directly with the American Ambassador.</p>
                            <p>In talking with Madame Chiang and Donald later after luncheon, McHugh
                                again inquired if the statement did not apply with equal force to
                                the United States. Chiang replied: “At least, they should <pb
                                    n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0385"/>take them as the
                                handwriting on the wall”. McHugh then referred to the
                                Generalissimo’s statement that he had reason to believe that Japan
                                would afford China very easy peace terms in return for an aboutface
                                toward the British. McHugh inquired how this could be sold to the
                                people of China who have been so generally aroused against Japan and
                                asked if it could be brought about by inflammatory speeches on the
                                part of Chinese officials against the British. He interpolated the
                                suggestion that this appeared possible in view of the remarkable
                                change in the attitude of the people towards foreigners today as
                                with the latter part of the last decade.</p>
                            <p>Madame Chiang evaded the suggestion that public opinion in China
                                could be aroused and directed from the top. She stated that she and
                                the Generalissimo had worked very hard to bring about a favorable
                                feeling toward foreigners. She added, however, that she believed the
                                people would accept peace with Japan if the Generalissimo told them
                                it was the best thing for China.</p>
                            <p>Donald informed McHugh later that the Generalissimo will attend the
                                Kuomintang Congress at Chungking in December and that foreign policy
                                for the coming year will be decided.</p>
                            <p>Chiang expressed his present firm determination both to Clark-Kerr
                                and McHugh to carry on with resistance. He claims to have divisions
                                available which he intends to dispose as follows: 60 east of the
                                Peiping–Hankow–Canton Railway; 60 west thereof; and 60 in reserve
                                under reorganization. He asserted that he expected to carry on
                                active guerrilla warfare in the areas east of the railways; that
                                although frontal resistance will be offered to the Japanese as they
                                advance, it is not his intention to attempt to hold any place in
                                force in the future, surrendering to them any large point they
                                choose to attack. He thereby hopes to gain the offensive by placing
                                the Japanese under constant threat of attack on all fronts, and
                                claims he will choose his own ground for battle.</p>
                            <p>He again asserted that he has supplies sufficient to continue the war
                                for another year at the present rate [of] consumption. He admitted
                                that many of his best divisions were seriously depleted and that he
                                did not expect to assume the offensive for some weeks yet. He is
                                apparently prepared to surrender both Changsha and Hengyang to the
                                Japanese if they choose to advance on those points in sufficient
                                force. He obviously is imbued with the experience he had in chasing
                                the Communists and intends to employ on a grand scale against the
                                Japanese the tactics he learned from those campaigns. He appeared to
                                have recovered from signs of the strain he exhibited during the
                                latter days in Hankow and to be physically fit and confident. He
                                exhibited no concern over the situation in the south; claimed that a
                                counter-attack was already under way; and stated that Samshui had
                                been reoccupied on the previous evening (November 7).</p>
                            <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0386"/>
                            <p>In response to a question about the situation in Szechwan, Madame
                                Chiang scoffed at the idea that any threat to national unity existed
                                there, pointing to the fact that the Generalissimo went there
                                practically alone 4 years ago in the face of similar rumors and
                                moved around at will. She added that he had even taken action
                                against the opium traffic which was Liu Hsiang’s chief source of
                                revenue and asserted confidently that he could return again at will.
                                Both she and Donald derided suggestions of a possible break up
                                behind the front, insisting that Chiang controls the army through
                                the younger officers which he educated and asserting that no leader,
                                either civil or military, could possibly command sufficient force to
                                question his authority.</p>

                            <p>734. 1. Although Ambassador Johnson has very likely reported on the
                                recent conversations between Chiang Kai Shek and the British
                                Ambassador to China, I nevertheless give the following brief summary
                                as told me by Craigie who asked that it be communicated exclusively
                                to the Department.</p>
                            <p>2. The Generalissimo seemed full of confidence with regard to the
                                future proposed basis of the hostilities against Japan. He stated
                                emphatically that the rapid fall of Canton had not been “bought” but
                                was due to inefficiency and to the fact that expected British
                                support had not been forthcoming. He said, however, that the fall
                                both of Hankow and Canton had been foreseen and discounted and that
                                China could continue the hostilities for another year.</p>
                            <p>3. Such continuance, however, would depend upon a currency loan from
                                Great Britain or the United States or both.</p>
                            <p>4. If no such assistance is forthcoming, China will be obliged to
                                seek other friends, namely, either (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Soviet
                                Russia or (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Japan itself. He implied that
                                if China eventually finds it necessary to throw in her lot with
                                Japan, it will mean the future exclusion of all other foreign
                                interests from China.</p>
                            <p>5. Craigie attaches importance to point (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                                above in the light of the appeal broadcast by the Japanese Prime
                                Minister to the Chinese nation referred to in paragraph 2 of our

                            <p>550. During a short conversation November 16, 11 a.m., with General
                                Chang Chun, formerly Minister for Foreign Affairs and now Chiang Kai
                                Shek’s representative in Chungking, Peck inquired concerning the
                                present state of the conflict with Japan and the following is a
                                summary of his appraisal:</p>
                            <p>As a thorough student of Japanese institutions, informant did not
                                think Japan financially capable of continuing present military
                                expenditures indefinitely nor on the other hand is Japan financially
                                exhausted. He thought the gold reserves of Japan probably amounted
                                to not more than 300 million yen whereas military expenditures in
                                the last 2 years had been between 10 and 20 billion but Japan has
                                not exhausted such extreme measures of finance as nationalization of
                                wealth and forced conversion of all Japanese foreign investments and
                                further use of note reserves. He thought that restrictions on
                                foreign trade had lowered the national income to a dangerous level.
                                Japan’s vulnerable point therefore is reached through foreign
                                economic pressure. China’s threefold need is for men, money and
                                munitions. The supply of men is inexhaustible and given financial
                                support and munitions China can fight indefinitely and is sure of
                                ultimate victory. China has sufficient rifles and ammunition, hand
                                grenades and such materials to last over an extended period but
                                desperately needs other equipment in which it is lacking. Japan’s
                                aim in the present war is as much to eradicate foreign interests and
                                influence in the Far East as to subjugate China. This fact as well
                                as the repeated official expressions of sympathy and approval on the
                                part of foreign powers leads China to regard foreign assistance in
                                the struggle as logical and deserved. He thought an international
                                conference say under the Nine-Power Treaty would afford an effective
                                method of approach to the matter and recalled that the Chinese
                                Government had suggested this.</p>
                            <p>China is not afraid to do the fighting but without money and
                                munitions its advantage in man power is nullified. If foreign
                                assistance were to be forthcoming, informant thought it would be
                                necessary for the United States and Great Britain to take the
                                initiative singly or jointly. He deplored apparent inability of
                                these two countries to work together in this crisis. France
                                obviously feels great fear of Japan and is now refusing even to
                                permit the disembarkation of non-military motor vehicles in
                                Kwangchou while transportation of munitions over the Yunnan Railway
                                is severely restricted. Informant expressed no resentment against
                                Germany or Italy but irritation <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384"
                                    facs="0388"/>at the failure of Great Britain to grant China a
                                loan. He thought the plea of the British Government that
                                Parliamentary approval of a loan would have to be obtained did not
                                carry weight because Great Britain had granted to Czechoslovakia
                                without any hesitation a loan similar to the one asked for by China
                                and moreover the Government has a clear majority in Parliament. He
                                expressed appreciation of the moral support given to China by the
                                present administration in the United States and the hope that since
                                the recent elections had left the administration with a strong
                                majority in Congress this moral support might soon be accompanied by
                                material support in the forms indicated. Informant said Japan’s
                                military man power is known exactly to the Chinese Government and is
                                not inexhaustible but he emphasized that even with superior human
                                resources China stood in great need of foreign aid in finances and
                                munitions if victory against the attack on China and on European and
                                American interests in China were to be assured. He asked that Peck
                                report his observations and said he was to receive the British
                                Ambassador the same morning and would make similar statements to
                                him.</p>

                            <p>553. Picture of Generalissimo in my 547 of November 16, 11 a.m. is of
                                a man committed to a prolonged and bitter resistance to Japanese
                                conquest with or without assistance from the outside; one who
                                believes that in the end resistance will be successful and that he
                                is not only fighting for the independence of his own people but that
                                the success of his efforts will mean much in the future of those
                                third powers who come to his aid now (and to that extent he is
                                fighting their battles for if he loses he argues that Japan plans to
                                monopolize all commercial opportunities to its own advantage). The
                                Generalissimo reveals himself as a Protestant Chinese Nationalist,
                                he desires assistance in his struggle, feels deeply that such aid is
                                due him from the democratic nations, whose interests he identifies
                                with China’s, but will not accept aid with strings attached.
                                Corroborative of this I recite the following. Donald told McHugh at
                                Changsha that Russians had informed Chiang that they had 100 planes
                                at Lanchow and were prepared to send more if he would continue
                                resistance to the Japanese. Chiang retorted that he intended to
                                continue resistance whether they <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385"
                                    facs="0389"/>helped him or not. This appears to be the nearest
                                their Government has come to presenting a <hi rend="italic">quid pro
                                    quo</hi> to Chiang as both Donald and Madame Chiang have denied
                                repeatedly to McHugh that Moscow has ever made specific proposals
                                and have insisted that China has paid for all help received to
                                date.</p>

                                Ambassador appears definitely to have dropped a hint that British

                                informs me that in conversation with British Ambassador on journey
                                to Chungking latter stated that on one of his visits to Hankow,
                                McHugh and I believe that (one) [<hi rend="italic">was?</hi>] about
                                the middle of July, the Generalissimo told Ambassador that he would
                                be glad to receive and consider any advice which the British
                                Ambassador might have to offer. Later Generalissimo asked the
                                British Ambassador to visit him and asked him whether he had advice
                                to give whereupon the Ambassador stated that if request was serious
                                he would advise the Generalissimo to bring the Young Marshal<note

                                up there and present a solid front to Japan. He suggested that Kung
                                be retained as President of the Executive Yuan (which he said he did
                                to save Kung’s face, but obviously implied that he would relieve
                                Kung of financial responsibility), give Madame Sun Yat Sen a
                                responsible place in the Government, suggesting a special post as
                                Minister of Cooperation, and generally reorganize the Government
                                along the representative lines used in selecting the delegates to
                                the People’s Political Council which had just met in Hankow. He
                                advised Chiang specifically to award posts according to merit and to
                                include all factions rather than to give the plums to his former
                                comrades. British Ambassador stated Generalissimo received these
                                suggestions coldly, commenting that Madame Sun would only be a
                                mouthpiece for the Communists. He told McHugh he had met Madame Sun
                                in Hong Kong; had liked her best of the whole family; and that she
                                had expressed her desire to go to Hankow if invited.</p>
                            <p>It is my belief that this was an attempt by the Generalissimo to find
                                out what might be considered necessary to put British Government in
                                a mood to make loan available (he was already disappointed with
                                outcome of Kung–Wang<note n="23" xml:id="d375fn23">C. T. Wang,

                                    facs="0390"/>United States and had recalled Wang), and that the
                                British Ambassador’s reply was a second hint that financial
                                assistance would be forthcoming from British sources provided Soong
                                assisted by Rogers (of Bank of England) might have the management
                                thereof and that a second time the Generalissimo refused assistance
                                with strings attached.</p>
                            <p>It is my belief that the Generalissimo is convinced that the time has
                                come when China, in dire need of compactness, must choose the source
                                of such assistance, and that he has attempted to portray vividly to
                                the British Ambassador the remonetizing or losses that will accrue
                                to Great Britain as the result of its decision whether or not to
                                assist China in time of need and thus determine the future direction
                                of China’s economic associations.</p>

                            <p>741. Our 734, November 16, 10 p.m. In further conversation today with
                                my British colleague I asked him whether he believed there was any
                                truth in the rumors published in Japan that his Government was now
                                considering a re-orientation of policy looking towards the
                                development of Anglo-Japanese collaboration in China instead of
                                further supporting the Chinese National Government. Craigie replied
                                emphatically in the negative. I asked him whether he thought there
                                was likelihood of a British loan to support the Chinese currency as
                                proposed by Chiang Kai Shek to the British Ambassador. Craigie said
                                he knew of no present concrete developments in that connection but
                                that the present trend of thought in London leaned towards the
                                building of the railway from Lashio in Burma into Yunnan and
                                Szechuan which he thought would be financed by various members of
                                the old consortium. He said that this was a long term policy and
                                that while overt plans in that direction would at first cause a
                                bitter <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0391"/>outcry from Japan
                                the building of the railway would in due course give Great Britain,
                                France and such powers as might participate an important leverage in
                                their relations with Japan. He, however, told me in strict secrecy
                                that from the purely strategic point of view a good many British
                                military authorities are opposed to the construction of such a
                                railway because in certain contingencies it might be captured by the
                                Japanese and used for an invasion of Burma. Craigie believes,
                                however, that some further concrete step in support of Chiang Kai
                                Shek will soon have to be taken by Great Britain if they wish to
                                avoid his being driven into the Japanese camp.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose, as of
                                possible interest to the Department, a copy in translation of a
                                leading article<note n="27" xml:id="d377fn27">Not printed.</note>
                                appearing in the <hi rend="italic">Hsin Hua Jih Pao</hi> on November
                                9, 1938, which endeavors to give an assessment of the Anglo-American
                                position in China in the light of Prince Konoye’s announcement of
                                November 3. Briefly, this journal considers that Prince Konoye’s
                                announcement amounts to a negative reply to the American
                                Government’s note of October 6; that it constitutes a threat to
                                American and British interests in the Far East; that the present
                                situation has come about partly as a result of the compromise policy
                                of the present British Government, which is compared unfavorably
                                with what is described as the more positive though hampered policy
                                of the American Government; that the gradual expansion of Japanese
                                activity in the Pacific area will bring Japan into inevitable
                                conflict with the United States and Great Britain; and that,
                                therefore, it is only necessary for China to continue its resistance
                                until such time as succor, produced of Japan’s overweening ambition
                                and pressure exerted by the people of the friendly Powers upon their
                                government, arrives.</p>
                            <p>In this connection, the foregoing views are largely shared by the
                                entire Chinese press of Chungking. Numerous articles have been
                                published which stress the progressive encroachment of the Japanese
                                upon American and European rights and interests in China; which
                                speculate upon the nature of the reaction of the Powers concerned to
                                these Japanese advances; and which urge upon the Powers vitally
                                interested—principally the United States and Great Britain—the
                                necessity of taking prompt and effective steps to safeguard their
                                    <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0392"/>rights and interests in
                                China, either by way of direct assistance to China or by the
                                application of economic sanctions to Japan.</p>
                            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Hsin Hua Jih Pao</hi>, as the Department is
                                aware, is a daily newspaper of the Chinese Communist party, which
                                commenced publication at Hankow in January 1938. Since the fall of
                                Hankow, this newspaper has begun publication in Chungking.</p>
                            <p>It may be well briefly to discuss the policy of this newspaper. In
                                internal affairs, its main consideration is the furthering of the
                                “united front” which it holds to be essential for the final ousting
                                of the Japanese from the Asiatic continent. In consequence, it gives
                                the appearance of supporting the National Government, especially
                                insofar as the prosecution of hostilities is concerned. It
                                constantly praises the person and principles of Sun Yat Sen,
                                professing to see in the latter the fundamentals for the
                                regeneration of the Chinese nation along democratic lines. Through
                                democracy, it hopes to achieve the Communist aim—a socialistic
                                republic. At present, it warmly supports the leadership of General
                                Chiang Kai-shek and is willing apparently to remain under his banner
                                so long as he continues to resist Japan. While it harbors a strong
                                suspicion against the Kuomintang, which it conceives to be following
                                a policy of hampering the activities of the Communist party, “united
                                front” considerations prevent it from adopting a critical attitude
                                toward that political group. Its strongest attacks are directed
                                toward so-called peace advocates, against whom the National
                                Government is urged to take the most drastic measures. It continues
                                to advocate suffrage, freedom of assembly, speech and press, and
                                unrestricted political party activity.</p>
                            <p>In the sphere of foreign affairs, its basic policy is, of course,
                                anti-Japanese and pro-Soviet Russian in the order named. Its thesis
                                is that the Japanese invasion will overreach itself in western China
                                and that prolonged resistance will in the end so exhaust the
                                Japanese that the latter will be driven out of China and off the
                                Asiatic continent. Prolonged resistance is expected to be maintained
                                through the agency of the “united front” and the development of the
                                mass movement and education among the population; negatively, it
                                advocates steps to prevent the Japanese from utilizing the areas
                                which the latter have occupied.</p>
                            <p>This organ maintains a policy of the utmost friendship toward the
                                Soviet Union, hailing it as China’s greatest friend and benefactor
                                in a period of darkest trials and tribulations. News of the Soviet
                                Union, copiously furnished by Tass News Agency, is accorded a
                                premier place in the news columns; while no opportunity is lost to
                                comment favorably upon the aims and policies of the Soviet Union.
                                Its policy toward Great Britain and France has been friendly, though
                                somewhat cool since the Munich agreement, which is held to have
                                constituted <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0393"/>a vital
                                democratic concession to the Berlin–Rome–Tokyo axis. Its attitude
                                toward the United States is studiously cordial, though it has
                                complained about the sale of arms to Japan and the failure of the
                                United States to take a more positive policy in the Far East. It is
                                violently critical of Germany and Italy, holding them to be allies
                                of Japan against China and the Soviet Union. In short, this
                                newspaper pleads for a coalition of the democracies, including China
                                and the Soviet Union, to curb what it terms the “Fascist group.”</p>
                            <p>In the economic field, this organ calls for relief of the peasantry
                                in the form of lower taxes, reduced rents, and reasonable rates of
                                interest. In common with the Kuomintang, it calls for the
                                development of the Northwest and the Southwest as economic bases for
                                future resistance against Japan, and advocates improved
                                communications. Though the Chinese Communist party undoubtedly
                                wishes for the socialization of industry and the redistribution of
                                land, the Communist newspaper has refrained from noticeable comment
                                thereon.</p>
                            <p>It is believed that the views of the <hi rend="italic">Hsin Hua Jih
                                    Pao</hi>, as described above, in general, represent the policy
                                of the leaders of the Chinese Communist party today, a policy which
                                appears to have as its basis the sinking of differences with the
                                Kuomintang, at least temporarily, in order to establish a national
                                unity that can avert Japanese domination of China and of the Chinese
                                people.</p>

                            </opener>
                            <p>557. My 553, November 18, 9 a.m. In response to his request I called
                                upon the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs November 19, 4 p.m.,
                                and he told me that he wished to give me a summary of conversations
                                that had recently taken place between the British Ambassador in
                                Changsha about 10 days ago and General Chiang Kai Shek and between
                                the British Ambassador and himself during the last 2 or 3 days
                                following the arrival of Sir Archibald Clark-Kerr in Chungking. What
                                follows is the substance of Dr. Wang’s remarks.</p>
                            <p>Sir Archibald and the Generalissimo had two or three long
                                conversations, but they might be reduced to this one point: China’s
                                situation had become so serious that it was essential for the
                                Chinese Government to have a definite yes or no answer to the
                                question whether Great Britain intended to continue its past
                                attitude of inaction in reference to the Sino-Japanese conflict, or
                                whether Great Britain intended <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390"
                                    facs="0394"/>to declare firm adherence to the Nine Power Treaty
                                and other treaties bearing on the Far Eastern situation, to give
                                China positive assistance in the form of a loan or otherwise, and to
                                execute the League resolutions with reference to the conflict.
                                General Chiang said that knowledge of Great Britain’s intentions in
                                regard to these matters was essential for the proper formulation of
                                China’s own foreign policies, especially in view of the meeting of
                                the Executive Committee of the Kuomintang Party which would occur in
                                Chungking in December, for at this time the Government must submit
                                its policies for discussion. Dr. Wang said that General Chiang’s
                                remarks to Sir Archibald were not in any sense an ultimatum but
                                rather an attempt to convey to the British Ambassador a sense of the
                                crisis that had been reached and an earnest plea to Great Britain to
                                act promptly on behalf of that country’s own interests and in
                                fulfillment of its announced position in relation to the matters
                                enumerated. Dr. Wang observed that he had asked Sir Archibald
                                whether he had communicated to his Government a report of the
                                conversations with General Chiang and Sir Archibald replied that he
                                had.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Wang said that he himself in view of Great Britain’s great
                                material interests in the Orient, possession of Hong Kong, Singapore
                                and other colonial areas, its investment in China, et cetera, had
                                conversed with Sir Archibald at length on these same subjects. Sir
                                Archibald had also talked with Dr. Wang Ching Wei,<note n="28"

                                said that as in the earlier case he would not go into the details
                                and ramifications of his conversations with the British Ambassador
                                but would reduce them to as small a compass as possible; he had
                                informed the British Ambassador (1) that China had reached a point
                                where it was imperative for China to know in order to shape its
                                present policy whether Great Britain would make a formal specific
                                and public declaration maintaining their adherence to the Nine Power
                                and other treaties on which the international situation in the Far
                                East is based; (2) that it was imperative that Great Britain inform
                                the Chinese Government at once and positively whether a loan would
                                be granted to China; (3) that it was imperative also that the
                                British Government indicate whether it is intended to take some
                                measure of reprisal short of war against Japan in retaliation for
                                the injuries inflicted by Japan on Great Britain’s prestige, rights
                                and interests in the Far East; and (4) that it was necessary that
                                the British Government inform the Chinese Government whether it
                                would take immediate steps to execute the various League resolutions
                                in regard to the Sino-Japanese conflict including resort to article
                                16 of the League Covenant providing for sanctions against Japan.</p>

                            <p>Dr. Wang said that these statements to the British Ambassador were
                                neither a threat nor an ultimatum but merely set forth assurances
                                that must be given and actions that must be taken by Great Britain
                                if China were to frame its policy in the conflict intelligently. Of
                                course, he said, it was the earnest hope of the Chinese Government
                                that Great Britain would at once give the assurances and take the
                                measures described above.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs further said that he had pointed out
                                to the British Ambassador that the Chinese Government was surprised
                                that while Great Britain and France had simultaneously with the
                                United States sent strong representations to the Japanese Government
                                protesting against the closing of the Yangtze to navigation, Great
                                Britain had not addressed to the Japanese Government any
                                communication similar to the note of the American Government of

                                would longer exist because Japan would be the only nation having any

                            <p>Dr. Wang said that the policy of the Japanese Government in respect
                                of China had recently undergone another drastic change; after months
                                of dispute over the so-called “China bureau” the idea of creating
                                such an organ had been dropped and there had been a “bureau of the
                                new system in Asia”, composed of the Ministers of War, Navy and
                                Foreign Affairs and the Premier, a super Cabinet under direction of
                                the army and navy to control the execution of Japan’s “holy” policy
                                toward not China alone but the whole of Asia. He added that public
                                statements made by Japanese statesmen and private conversations held
                                by himself with various of the highest Japanese leaders in Tokyo 3
                                years before proved that the “holy” policy of Japan was that of
                                eradicating from the whole of Asia all Occidental interests and
                                influence. He said that the then Japanese Minister of War had
                                calculated that experts thoroughly understood China’s aspiration to
                                maintain its integrity and independence and would assist China to
                                the fullest extent in achieving this, but on one condition, that is,
                                that China cease to rely on the United States and Great Britain
                                culturally, economically, or politically, [and] depend only on
                                Japan. Dr. Wang asked that I regard this information as given to me
                                in strict confidence.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Wang said that he had received through the Japanese Domei agency

                                protests in regard to the continued closing of the Yangtze River to

                                powers; he wondered therefore what steps would be taken by the
                                American Government in the face of this rebuff.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Wang said that he hoped that I would report to my Government the
                                purport of his remarks, and that he most earnestly hoped that the
                                United States would cooperate in this crisis.</p>
                            <p>I desire to add that Dr. Wang expressed no disappointment with the
                                American attitude, actions, or failure to act in reference to the
                                conflict but on the contrary said that he had plainly indicated to
                                the British Ambassador the feeling of the Chinese Government that
                                Great Britain had failed to afford the United States adequate
                                support in the more advanced position we had taken on behalf of the
                                established treaty position in the Far East. The Minister made it
                                evident that Chiang and he are preparing to face a possible demand
                                in the Executive Committee meeting for a reorientation of policy and
                                to defend their course of relying for moral and material support on
                                the Western Powers particularly the United States and Great Britain.
                                In this connection I told the Minister that the position of the
                                American Government toward the treaty situation and the present
                                conflict has been made crystal clear in public statements including

                                added that no one would be able to forecast the future actions of
                                the American Government in pursuance of its announced policy since
                                these would be determined by circumstances.</p>

                                called this morning and spent something over an hour in discussing
                                various phases of present American-Japanese relations. The gist of
                                his remarks is as follows: <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0397"/>

                                    <item>The present dislocations to foreign and other trade are
                                        results of the necessities of a military situation in which,
                                        to use the Yangtze River as an example, the need for secrecy
                                        in the preparation and conduct of operations is such as to
                                        render it very unwise to permit circulation of individuals
                                        of other than Japanese nationality within the zones of the
                                        armies or along their lines of communication. In the past,
                                        operations have been frequently harmed through the
                                        activities of persons who had been permitted opportunities
                                        for observation in reporting their observations to the
                                        Chinese. The success of the military operations is so vital
                                        that they cannot afford to expose them to any hazards that
                                        can possibly be eliminated. The situation is one in which
                                        “they must go on”, as any turning back would mean defeat,
                                        and every effort is being made to bring a quick end to
                                        present conditions in order that the work of rehabilitation
                                        may be started.</item>

                                    <item>The earnest desire of the Japanese government is to bring
                                        about stable conditions in order that the pursuits of peace
                                        may be resumed. It has no desire to exclude any nation from

                                        derived from free competition. Under such conditions the
                                        Japanese have no fear for the economic future as there are
                                        many lines of endeavor in which they can compete
                                        successfully by reason of their advantages in proximity and
                                        in lower manufacturing costs, and that naturally, the losers
                                        in such competition will find the scope of their activities
                                        considerably curtailed. However, there is no desire to
                                        exclude activities in which the Japanese cannot compete as
                                        such action would only result in hampering the work of
                                        reestablishment. It is very likely that what has happened in
                                        Manchuria will be repeated in China; that certain forms of
                                        foreign trade will be eliminated as a result of Japanese
                                        competition but that, by reason of the betterment of
                                        conditions in general and the raising of Chinese purchasing
                                        power, the general total of foreign trade will be
                                        increased.</item>

                                    <item>The present situation marks a turning point in
                                        American-Japanese relations, and it is hoped that the
                                        discussions may be carried on in a manner which will have a
                                        calming effect on the two peoples. It is likewise hoped that
                                        the United States will not be dragged into an adoption of
                                        the British attitude as a result of a combination of the
                                        present anti-Japanese feeling, new animosities engendered by
                                        the present problem, and a dislike for Nazi or Fascist ideas
                                        which are commonly represented as being rampant in Japan at
                                        present. The American antipathy to these doctrines is a
                                        natural one and resentment at efforts toward their
                                        propagation in the United States is understandable. Japan
                                        therefore, though neither Nazi nor Fascist, but finding
                                        points which it can admire in both, has carefully refrained

                                    <item>American resentment at the present disturbance to trade is
                                        likewise entirely natural and thinking Japanese can have no
                                        objection on that score. However, it is felt that the
                                        present representations of the American Government may
                                        reflect an “economic fear”, and that the Japanese Government
                                        is anxious to allay the suspicions growing out of such
                                        apprehension. In order to accomplish this end, it is
                                        important that both the Japanese and American peoples act
                                        with forbearance and an appreciation of each other’s

                                    to the seriousness with which Colonel Nishi presented his case,
                                    or the emphasis with which he stated that there is no thought of
                                    eliminating any foreign enterprise which can stand up under open
                                    competition. It is interesting to note that he brought up the
                                    same point regarding the increase of American trade in Manchuria
                                    as did the Foreign Minister in conversation with the

                                <item>As a soldier, Colonel Nishi is firmly of the opinion that the
                                    military situation must be settled before any great resumption
                                    of commercial activities can be accomplished. When it was
                                    suggested that some slight concessions in favor of foreign
                                    trade, and some relief from existing restrictions would go a
                                    long way toward bettering American opinion and removing causes
                                    for apprehension, he invariably returned to the contention that
                                    any freedom of movement by persons sympathetic toward the
                                    Chinese cause would constitute a grave hazard to the success of
                                    military activities.</item>

                                <item>The whole conversation may be summed up as a plea for
                                    understanding, a disclaimer of a desire to eliminate foreign
                                    interests, and an expression of the hope that the American
                                    people may find it possible to bear with the situation until the
                                    day when a resumption of normal conditions will operate toward a
                                    return of those trade conditions which all desire to see

                            <p>On the basis of this information Sir Robert Craigie called on Prince
                                Konoye secretly on November 1 and said that if the information were
                                correct, his Government would be willing to consider mediation on
                                the aforesaid conditions on Japanese initiative. The Prime Minister
                                replied that Japan did not at the present time desire such
                                mediation.</p>
                            <p>At the end of this interview with the Prime Minister it was mutually
                                agreed that if any publicity should occur, the Japanese Government
                                would deny that Great Britain had offered mediation. The English
                                interpreter, Mr. Tsuchiya, confirmed this understanding to the
                                Ambassador.</p>
                            <p>A few days later, Mr. Shiratori<note n="36" xml:id="d380fn36">Toshio
                                    Shiratori, former Japanese Minister in Sweden.</note> approached
                                Sir Robert at the club and spoke of Great Britain’s “offer of
                                mediation” which Mr. Shiratori said was of course out of the
                                question at the present time.</p>
                            <p>In a conversation day before yesterday with the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs, Mr. Arita mentioned the matter in the same vein. Sir Robert
                                told him the facts and protested at the publicity recently given to
                                this subject in <hi rend="italic">Yomiuri</hi>.</p>
                            <p>Sir Robert thinks that Mr. Shiratori was probably the source of the
                                publicity, having heard of the secret interview, but that Mr. Arita
                                himself might have taken offense because, although Sir Robert’s
                                appointment with Prince Konoye was made on the evening before the
                                announcement of Mr. Arita’s appointment, the interview actually took
                                place after Mr. Arita had assumed office.</p>

                                Tokyo on November 25 (second anniversary of the Anti-Comintern Pact)
                                by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the German Ambassador.<note

                                        rend="smallcaps">iv</hi>, pp. 680 ff.</note> It consists of
                                a preamble in which the contracting parties express intention to
                                strengthen “bonds of friendship and mutual confidence” by “deepening
                                their manifold cultural relations” and of four articles which in
                                effect provide for promotion of relations in the fields of “science
                                and fine arts, music and literature, youth movements, sports et
                                cetera.[”]</p>
                            <p>2. The convention probably carried no secret clauses but it is
                                obviously a significant indication of the trend toward closer
                                political association of Japan and Germany and a part of program of
                                preparation to move, <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with closer
                                association with each other of Great Britain and France toward a
                                definite Japanese-German political arrangement.</p>
                            <p>3. My British colleague tells me that he has “absolutely reliable”
                                information that negotiations are now proceeding for a marked
                                strengthening of the German-Italian-Japanese Axis but that Italy is
                                showing some reluctance. Craigie regrets that he cannot give me the
                                source but said that he is sworn to secrecy.</p>

                            <p>752. The local press has recently carried reports to the effect that
                                the Japanese Ambassador in London had persuaded the British
                                Government of the advantage of cooperation with Japan in the Far
                                East.</p>
                            <p>In this connection my British colleague showed me this morning a
                                telegram from his Government stating that no such message has in any
                                way been inspired by any official or any department in London.

                            <quote rend="blockquote">

                            <p>2. We have been unable to obtain any authoritative or otherwise
                                reliable indication of the nature of this “fundamental policy”, and
                                as we understand that general indications of the character of this
                                policy are to be given out in the next few days, we believe that an
                                appraisal of various conjectures now current would not be helpful to

                                    xml:id="d384fn42">Not printed.</note> of the text of the
                                resolutions said to have been adopted at the Enlarged Sixth Plenary
                                Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Communist
                                Party, which was held at Yenan, Shensi, with practically all the
                                important leaders of the Party in attendance, in late September and
                                early October of this <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0402"/>year.
                                These resolutions were published in the November 23 edition of the
                                    <hi rend="italic">Hsin Hua Jih Pao</hi>, the official newspaper
                                of the Chinese Communist Party which is now established at
                                Chungking.</p>
                            <p>The importance of these resolutions is believed to lie in the fact
                                that they appear to commit the Chinese Communist Party categorically
                                to a vital compromise of political policy vis-a-vis the Kuomintang.
                                In other words, the Chinese Communist Party has come to the
                                conclusion that the vital task of today lies in the defeat of the
                                Japanese, and they have accordingly committed themselves to an
                                almost complete reorientation of policy in order to achieve the
                                united front which they consider to be essential to the achievement
                                of the final victory. It is essential to note, however, that they
                                maintain the right to preserve their independent political
                                organization—a fundamental tenet of that group; and that their
                                ultimate aspiration is a San Min Chu I democracy, under which the
                                Chinese Communist Party will be enabled to pursue an independent,
                                free existence without let or hindrance.</p>
                            <p>Competent Chinese and foreign observers at Chungking are generally of
                                the opinion that the resolutions, as set forth above, genuinely
                                reflect the present day attitude of the Chinese Communist leaders,
                                who are sincerely desirous, even at the expense of fundamental
                                principles, of cooperating with other anti-Japanese elements in the
                                task of expelling the Japanese from Chinese territory.</p>
                            <p>In the interest of timeliness, this despatch is being sent to the
                                Department by airmail. A complete translation of the resolutions is
                                in the course of preparation and will be forwarded at an early

                            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs presents its compliments to the
                                American Embassy and, with reference to the forcible attempts of
                                Japan to seize the various Chinese courts in the concession areas at
                                Shanghai, has the honor to recall that the Ministry has repeatedly
                                discussed the matter with His Excellency Nelson Trusler Johnson,
                                American Ambassador, as well as having detailed officials to proceed
                                to the Embassy to conduct negotiations. The request to adopt a stern
                                    <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0403"/>attitude firmly
                                rejecting Japanese interference has already aroused the attention of
                                the American Embassy.</p>
                            <p>The establishment of the Chinese courts in question and the exercise
                                of their functions are based upon international agreements signed by
                                the various powers concerned; they possess an intimate relation to
                                the peace of the concessions. Once they are seized by Japan, not
                                only will Chinese citizens in the concessions be exposed to danger,
                                but also foreign nationals without extraterritorial rights and even
                                foreigners with extraterritorial rights, will be greatly threatened;
                                in fact, this would amount to control of the whole of the
                                concessions and cannot be regarded with indifference.</p>
                            <p>A confidential report has recently been received to the effect that
                                Japan’s attempts forcibly to seize the various Chinese courts in the
                                concessions at Shanghai have been more intensified, and there is
                                talk that it will open Hongkew as a <hi rend="italic">quid pro
                                    quo</hi> for the taking over of the courts. If this information
                                is true, it is thought that the various parties affected will be
                                able to foresee the consequences. The Ministry has the honor,
                                therefore, especially to request that the American Embassy take note
                                of the matter and that it continue to adhere to its previous policy
                                in relation to the Chinese courts of exhausting all efforts for
                                their protection; that is, that it firmly reject Japan’s illegal
                                interference, in order to uphold international agreements. The
                                Ministry is appreciative of the Embassy’s friendliness in the
                                matter.</p>

                                of this important event is indicative of the secrecy with which the
                                plan for the holding of this conference was carried.) He added that

                            <p>760–762. 1. As a result of the recent modification in policy
                                announced by the Japanese Government and also as a result of the
                                recent conversations between Chiang Kai Shek and the British
                                Ambassador in China, my British colleague and I have had several
                                informal talks by way of endeavoring to appraise the new situation.
                                We are agreed on the following points: <list>
                                    <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                    <item>If any assistance is to be given by our respective
                                        Governments to Chiang Kai Shek there is little time to be
                                        lost if the assistance is to be effective.</item>
                                    <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                    <item>There is every indication that the discrimination against
                                        foreign interests in China will be continuous and
                                        progressive.</item>
                                    <label>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)</label>
                                    <item>Japan is under the governance of the military elements and
                                        the trend toward some authoritarian government is becoming
                                        progressively more pronounced. The restraining influence of
                                        the civilian and liberal elements has become so feeble that
                                        it may be entirely eliminated from our calculations.</item>
                                    <label>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>)</label>
                                    <item>There is in process a strengthening of the anti-Comintern
                                        feeling. (Craigie is convinced that the further agreement
                                        which is in view between Germany, Italy and Japan can only
                                        be designed to strengthen political and possibly military
                                        ties and will be directed more against the democratic powers
                                        than against Soviet Russia. My feeling is that Germany and
                                        Japan and Italy if they can bring her along intend to keep
                                        step with any further strengthening of the ties between
                                        Great Britain and France.)</item>
                                    <label>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>)</label>
                                    <item>Although there are indications that the hostilities are
                                        exerting a progressive strain on Japan’s economic structure,
                                        reliance on this factor alone to bring about moderation of
                                        Japanese policies would be illusory.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>2. Craigie further feels that, although the impact of a strengthened
                                totalitarian combination would first fall on British interests in
                                the Far East, it would only be a question of time before the “vital
                                interests” of the United States also became affected. He is
                                convinced further that the hardening of the Japanese attitude is due
                                not only to recent military victories but to the conviction in
                                military and naval circles that the democracies are not prepared to
                                risk war under any circumstance. My position on these two points is
                                that they are matters of opinion or of impressions and do not fall
                                within the realm of demonstrable fact.</p>
                            <p>3. Craigie proposed that we jointly recommend to our respective
                                Governments that there is little to be lost—and much may be
                                gained—from <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0405"/>resolute action
                                taken jointly by the United States and the British Empire
                                (preferably with French cooperation) to maintain our position,
                                rights and interests in the Far East. The measures which he proposed
                                for recommendation to our Governments were: (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >a</hi>) joint currency loan to China; (<hi rend="italic"
                                >b</hi>) denunciation of respective treaties of commerce with Japan
                                with a clear indication of the reasons for this step; (<hi
                                    rend="italic">c</hi>) raising of the French embargo on the
                                passage of munitions through Indochina.</p>
                            <p>4. I have told Craigie that after very carefully and thoroughly
                                considering the problem for several days I am not able to conform to
                                his suggested recommendations.</p>
                            <p>5. I said first that my Government is in possession, from many
                                sources, of all available facts upon which to formulate and carry
                                out its policies and actions and furthermore that it is in a far
                                better position than I am to estimate the desires and restraints of
                                American public opinion. These factors alone would deter me from
                                making such a recommendation as he proposed even if I believed in
                                the wisdom and efficacy of retaliatory measures.</p>
                            <p>6. As a matter of fact, however, I expressed to Craigie my belief
                                that in the present temper of the Japanese Government, of the
                                Japanese military and of a preponderant element of the Japanese
                                public, such sanctions as he lists would defeat their own object and
                                would simply result in making the Japanese more intransigent than
                                ever against the interests of the participating nations. I could not
                                estimate the practical effect of loans to the Chinese nationalists
                                but any practical effects accruing from the denunciation of our
                                respective commercial treaties with Japan would take a long time to
                                register. I expressed doubts over the soundness of Craigie’s belief
                                that concerted action by the three powers along the lines he had
                                suggested would lead to a satisfactory reorientation of Japanese
                                policies. I admitted that he might be right but on the other hand I
                                could not bring myself to believe that our Governments can afford to

                                exerted through economic measures. It would seem to me extremely
                                hazardous to assume that the program which Japan is carrying out at
                                such enormous costs would be allowed to collapse upon there being
                                brought about precisely that situation which the program was
                                intended to meet.</p>
                            <p>7. I told Craigie that ever since the hostilities in China began I
                                had endeavored to render maximum protection to American interests
                                but <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0406"/>at the same time to
                                avoid recommendations or action which in my opinion would steer the
                                United States into dangerous channels which American public opinion
                                would not countenance. In all conscience therefore I found myself
                                unable to go along with him in the recommendations which he
                                proposed.</p>
                            <p>8. I then talked frankly of the marked difference in the respective
                                positions of the United States and Great Britain in the Far East. I
                                pointed out that the United States and Great Britain have common
                                interests and concern in the broad field of influencing of policy
                                such as the Open Door and that in the specific field of Far Eastern
                                politics they oppose violation of the territorial and administrative
                                integrity of China. They furthermore have a common interest in
                                specific issues which have been created in China in violation of the
                                above mentioned principles. There are, however, other political and
                                economic considerations which do not affect the two countries in
                                equal degree, and it seemed to me that such defensive measures as
                                Great Britain might consider necessary to protect British interests
                                might not necessarily commend themselves to the United States.</p>
                            <p>9. Craigie replied that he fully recognized the justice of my
                                position and that he did not wish to press me unduly. He said that
                                it is only his deep sense of the gravity of impending events and his
                                feeling that there is now no time to be lost that led him to put
                                forward his suggestions.</p>
                            <p>10. The Department will undoubtedly recognize the fact that Craigie’s
                                complete frankness with me called for equal frankness on my part and
                                that in my personal observations to him I was in no manner
                                committing my own Government.</p>

                                at Washington to replace Mr. Saito, Mr. Kensuke Horinouchi delivered
                                an address before the America–Japan Society of the Kwansai at Osaka
                                on November 18, and also before the America–Japan Society in Tokyo

                                published Mr. Horinouchi’s addresses. As may be expected the two
                                speeches are very similar, with only such changes as were demanded
                                by the locality in which the Ambassador-designate spoke. It is,
                                however, significant that on both occasions, he made reference to
                                the “new order in East Asia” for which Japan is striving, based upon
                                cultural and economic “coordination between Japan, Manchukuo and
                                China”. This is, of course, recognizable as Mr. Arita’s
                                “Japan–Manchukuo–China bloc” to which he has recently made reference
                                in conversations with my British colleague and myself.<note n="*"

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: There has recently been a marked
                                renewal of activities along the lines of the Berlin–Rome–Tokyo axis
                                and evidence of a strengthening of the relations between Japan and
                                the states with totalitarian or authoritarian forms of
                                government—Soviet Russia always excepted. These activities are, of
                                course, somewhat seasonal, as the month of November marks the
                                anniversaries of the anti-comintern pacts with Germany and with
                                Italy, but this fact alone would not account for Japan’s
                                increasingly strong swing toward those and other non-democratic
                                states.</p>
                            <p>Celebrations here began on November 6, which marked the first
                                anniversary of the Italo-German-Japanese anti-comintern pact, and
                                ended on November 25, the second anniversary of the conclusion of
                                the German-Japanese anti-comintern pact, with the signature, in
                                Tokyo, of a cultural convention with Germany. This pact, which is
                                similar to one signed at Rome on November 23 between Germany and
                                Italy, consists of a preamble in which the contracting parties
                                express the intention to strengthen “bonds of friendship and mutual
                                confidence” by “deepening their manifold cultural relations”, and of
                                four articles which in effect provide for the promotion of relations
                                in the fields of “science and fine arts, music and literature, youth
                                movements, sports, <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0408"/>et
                                cetera”. The text of the convention, together with the Foreign
                                Office’s statement accompanying its publication, as it appeared in
                                the <hi rend="italic">Japan Advertiser</hi> of November 26, is
                                    enclosed.<note n="49" xml:id="d389fn49">Not

                            <p>This convention probably carries no secret clauses but, as remarked
                                in the press (<hi rend="italic">Nichi-Nichi</hi> of November 25,
                                1938), “necessarily pushes the anti-comintern pact another step
                                forward”. As stated in the Embassy’s telegram reporting its
                                    signature,<note n="*" xml:id="d389fn50">Embassy’s telegram No.
                                    751, November 26, noon. [Footnote in the original.]</note> the
                                convention is obviously a significant indication of the trend toward
                                a closer political association of Japan and Germany and a part of a
                                program to move, <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with each other
                                of Great Britain and France, toward a definite Japanese-German
                                political arrangement.</p>
                            <p>Since the fall of Canton and the Wuhan cities and the advent of Mr.
                                Arita as Foreign Minister it has become evident that Japan’s policy
                                and attitude toward the United States, Great Britain, and France
                                with respect to their rights and interests in China have undergone a
                                marked change. Whereas, up to that time, at least the fiction of
                                support of the Nine Power Treaty, the Open Door, and the principle
                                of equality of treatment was maintained by Japan, this has since
                                been dispelled through the adoption by Japan of a policy of creating
                                “a new order in East Asia” which involves the establishment of a
                                Japan–China–“Manchukuo” bloc and a demand for a modification of the
                                principles of the Open Door and equality of opportunity in China.
                                This reorientation in policy toward the powers with interests in
                                China is part and parcel of Japan’s broader policy of attempting to
                                create in East Asia a Japan-dominated self-contained economic and
                                political entity similar to the United States, Russia, or the
                                British Empire. It is now the intention of Japan, as revealed by the

                                of security against the possible application of sanctions either by
                                the League of Nations or “by nations inside and outside the League”.
                                Adherence to such a policy would logically tend to find Japan on one
                                side and those powers having interests in China, that is, the United
                                States, Great Britain, and France, on the other side. Furthermore,
                                to the extent to which these three countries, which are incidentally
                                the leading democracies, draw closer to one another—not only in
                                respect of East Asia but in other fields, notably Europe—to the same
                                degree is Japan induced to draw closer to the countries opposed to
                                the democracies, namely Italy and Germany, whose interests in China
                                are, incidentally, negligible. Italy and Germany, too, are outside
                                the League of Nations, along with Japan; and those two countries,
                                with <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0409"/>their strong navies
                                and air forces, are becoming more and more potentially valuable to
                                Japan as the risk of pressure from Great Britain and France in the
                                East increases with Japan’s announced policy of demanding a revision
                                of the principles which have hitherto provided a measure of
                                protection for foreign rights and interests in China.</p>
                            <p>It is interesting to note how greatly developments in Europe have
                                favored Japan and how recent events there have drawn Japan into what
                                is becoming the anti-democratic camp. While it is true that the
                                Berlin–Rome–Tokyo axis was founded upon a common anti-communist
                                ideology, and that it outwardly retains the anti-comintern form,
                                events of world importance, based upon a fundamental cleavage in
                                thought between those countries whose interests lie in the direction
                                of maintaining the post-war <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> and
                                those in whose interests it is to alter it, have aligned the
                                anti-comintern states against the democracies. In the Far East it is
                                the democracies whose interests are being threatened in China by
                                Japan. In Europe it is the democracies whose interests have been and
                                are being threatened by Germany and Italy. The Czechoslovak crisis
                                thus provided an ideal moment for the powers who control the
                                destinies of Japan to launch, simultaneously with the establishment
                                of a China Board, a new policy which is developing into a virtual
                                protectorate over all of China with the continued existence, to say
                                nothing of the protection, of the rights and interests of the
                                foreign powers in that area in the hands of the Japanese military.
                                The results of the Munich Conference were interpreted by Japan as an
                                admission by the democratic states of their inability to match the
                                strength of the Berlin–Rome axis, and this gave further impetus to
                                the policy of strengthening Japan’s ties with that axis.</p>
                            <p>Still another factor in this policy is the growing sympathy on the
                                part of Japan with the nations in Europe having authoritarian forms
                                of Government. The China incident has hastened the establishment of
                                the virtually unchallenged supremacy of the military in the
                                government of Japan. Those liberal or civilian elements whose
                                influence may have been felt, at least beneath the surface of
                                things, prior to the outbreak of the hostilities with China, are
                                today reduced to utter impotence, and something closely approaching
                                an authoritarian form of government under the shogunate of the
                                military may be said to have arrived.</p>
                            <p>Japan’s gravitation toward the circle of authoritarian states has for
                                some time been manifest. It will be recalled that in 1936 a cultural
                                pact was signed between Japan and Poland; this closely followed the
                                signature of the anti-comintern pact with Germany and was Japan’s
                                second step toward emerging from its political isolation and a bid
                                for solidarity with a country whose policy was anti-Soviet. It is
                                also interesting to note that Poland’s form of government then, as
                                now, closely approached the authoritarian form.</p>
                            <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0410"/>
                            <p>It may be added parenthetically that the news that Poland had, on
                                November 26, suddenly decided to extend her non-aggression pact of
                                1932 with Soviet Russia until 1945, was badly received by the press
                                here and this action was interpreted as Poland’s withdrawal from the
                                anti-comintern bloc. In fact, so much stir was caused in the
                                editorial columns of the local newspapers that the Polish
                                Ambassador, Mr. Thaddeus de Romer, called upon the Vice Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs on the following day to reassure him that Poland’s
                                action was not to be construed as prejudicial to the friendly
                                relations with Japan.</p>
                            <p>On November 15 a cultural pact was concluded between Japan and
                                Hungary, another state verging on the authoritarian. This pact,
                                incidently, is reported to take effect upon the same day as the pact
                                with Germany, on November 25.</p>
                            <p>Japan’s association, in varying degrees of intimacy, with the
                                authoritarian states is therefore apparent; this is due somewhat to
                                her sympathy for that particular ideology. The fact, however, that
                                those states, each in its own way, shares some of Japan’s own
                                problems is of course the real reason behind this association.
                                Germany and Italy have no axe to grind in the East; they are,
                                moreover, opposed in Europe by the same powers, England and France,
                                as, with the addition of the United States, are opposed by Japan in
                                China. Thus Germany, Italy, and Japan, who were originally drawn
                                together by the common denominator of anti-communism, are now being
                                bound more closely by their common opposition to the so-called
                                democratic states, and this process will probably continue until
                                something occurs in the political field to reverse the circle now in
                                operation. Such a move might, for instance, be a successful attempt
                                on the part of Great Britain to wean Italy away from the Berlin–Rome
                                axis. At this point, however, we enter the realm of pure
                                speculation.</p>

                            <p>Diplomatic representations to Japan have not caused Japan to respect
                                American rights and interests in China. Japan continues to injure
                                those rights and interests. In view of this, it is suggested in
                                various quarters that the United States should supplement its
                                diplomatic <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0411"/>representations
                                by embarking on a course of retaliatory measures against Japan.</p>
                            <p>Any action along this line, if taken, should be based, it is
                                believed, upon the principle of taking measures of self-defense

                                and interests, and be not based upon the principle of taking
                                punitive action against an aggressor nation.</p>

                                        general world interests seems to warrant incurring such a

                                choice of a course of action need not necessarily be confined to the
                                alternatives of a complete and effective program of retaliation or
                                no <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0412"/>action at all. It is
                                suggested that this Government might advisedly consider adopting
                                certain intermediate steps which would undoubtedly be taken
                                seriously by the Japanese and possibly have a sobering effect upon
                                the Japanese, although such steps could not be expected to cause
                                Japan to desist from its program of aggression in China. The
                                measures under reference are governmental action in discouragement
                                of loans or credits to Japan and, if the problem discussed in the

                                    Arranging for some satisfactory method of continuing to admit
                                    Japanese merchants to this country. [Footnote in the
                                    original.]</note> can be satisfactorily disposed of, the giving
                                of notice of termination of our commercial treaty with Japan. It is
                                believed that these measures might not lead to retaliation by Japan.
                                These measures would seem to be in a category entirely different
                                from direct retaliatory measures such as the restriction or
                                exclusion of Japanese trade, restrictions upon the exportation of
                                certain commodities to Japan, etc. Restrictions upon trade with
                                Japan affect the personal fortunes of firms and individuals in Japan
                                and therefore create a solid basis for national resentment of the
                                type which leads to counter-retaliation. The two measures mentioned,
                                however, affect no interest immediately, are not unfriendly acts,
                                and do not put this country in a position from which it must advance
                                (but at the same time they would serve to clear our decks). Although
                                there is little likelihood that American funds will be invested in
                                Japan in the near future, the time may come when Japan will become
                                more attractive as an investment field. Unless there is some
                                settlement in the Far East based on the principles in which this
                                Government believes, the Department could not view with equanimity
                                the investment of American funds in Japan or Japanese-controlled
                                areas. It seems preferable that a Government policy of discouraging
                                loans or credits be announced while there is no substantial
                                objection to it. A ban on loans and credits could be defended from
                                either the isolationists’ or internationalists’ point of view. In
                                regard to the cancellation of the commercial treaty, Japan is
                                traveling rapidly along the road marked out by Germany, and Japan’s
                                commercial methods are becoming so alien to those of the United
                                States that the United States can hardly avoid denouncing the
                                commercial treaty with Japan before another year or two has elapsed,
                                and denunciation before that time might well be considered.</p>
                            <p>It is believed that announcement of a Government policy of
                                discouraging loans or credits to Japan and the giving of notice to
                                Japan with regard to termination of the commercial treaty are
                                measures warranting favorable consideration. No definite
                                recommendation is made as to whether either or both of these
                                measures should be adopted immediately or at some given time in the
                                future for the reason that it <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409"
                                    facs="0413"/>is considered important that decision with regard
                                to adoption of the measures be correlated with consideration of
                                other matters, both domestic and external, affecting our relations
                                with Japan.</p>
                            <p>It is suggested, further, that endeavor might well be made at this
                                time to obtain revision of Section 338 of the Tariff Act of
                                    1930<note n="52" xml:id="d390fn52">46 Stat. 590, 704.</note>
                                along the lines indicated in section numbered 5. The question
                                whether the revised section should be applied against Japan need not
                                be decided at this time.</p>
                            <p>The study made of the retaliatory steps which the United States might
                                take against Japan has brought to mind the question of the
                                advisability of the United States extending aid to China. Although
                                no detailed study has been given to that question by those
                                collaborating in the preparation of this memorandum, it seems to
                                them that the extending of aid to China would not be likely to
                                involve complications as serious as those which would result should
                                the United States adopt a thorough-going and comprehensive program
                                of retaliation against Japan. The granting of aid to China would not
                                cause widespread domestic economic dislocation in this country and
                                would not involve the risk of overthrowing the principles of
                                commercial policy to which this Government is committed. Moreover,
                                it is believed that, although Japan would undoubtedly resent the
                                extension of aid by the United States to the Chinese Government,
                                Japan’s resentment would not be likely to express itself in as
                                drastic a form as would be the case should the United States adopt a
                                comprehensive program of retaliation against Japan. It is realized,
                                however, that embarkation by the United States upon a definite
                                course of extending aid to the Chinese Government involves important
                                questions of policy (such as the question of the advisability of
                                deviating from the course hitherto pursued by the United States of
                                not taking sides in a material way in the conflict between China and
                                Japan, the question whether congressional authority would be needed,
                                the question whether Congress and the country would support such a
                                course, etc.). An examination of these questions of policy is
                                outside the purview of this memorandum.</p>

                            <p>My attention was specifically called to the fact that in the
                                German-Japanese anti-Comintern agreement the U. S. S. R. was
                                specifically mentioned, whereas in the new agreement any third power
                                is included.</p>
                            <p>I was further informed that a secret supplementary treaty had been
                                drafted by the Japanese Government and had been submitted to the
                                other two powers. This proposed secret agreement specified just how
                                much support was to be rendered in the contingencies envisaged in
                                the two articles of the agreement above mentioned, and just how far
                                such support should be carried. The British Government was advised
                                that the Italian Government has so far insisted that there be a
                                year’s delay before any decision was reached on this Japanese
                                suggestion, and that the German Government has up to the present
                                remained non-committal. I was further informed that the Japanese
                                were very strenuously urging that an agreement be reached on this
                                supplementary treaty without any further delay.</p>

                                night he significantly remarked that he had learned from
                                authoritative Japanese quarters that the Japanese Government felt
                                the hour was approaching when it might be possible to bring about an
                                Anglo-Japanese agreement in connection with their respective
                                interests in China. The Japanese were very hopeful of bringing this
                                about but were concerned lest the United States place obstacles in
                                the way. In fact, the Japanese felt that if the United States did
                                not oppose such an agreement, the British and Japs might come to
                                terms within a reasonable period of time.</p>
                            <p>(The foregoing remarks rendered even more interesting a report which

                                the Japanese Government had told British Ambassador Craigie that
                                they regretted relations between their two countries were drifting;
                                apart, and that the Japanese Government was anxious to amend this
                                condition, due to pressure from Germany to seal the Anti-Comintern
                                Pact with a military alliance.)</p>
                            <p>The Minister then remarked that in his opinion Britain’s ability to
                                concentrate effectively on a Western European appeasement and
                                pacification was hampered mainly by her difficulties in the Far
                                East. Britain could not be expected to handle both problems
                                effectively at the same time until she had attained the desired
                                standard of rearmament—and that was still some time off. In fact,
                                times had changed since those days when Britain used to be able to
                                treat with problems one by one as they arose within her Empire.
                                London then sat back calmly while her diplomats and troops localized
                                difficulties and effected a settlement. Nowadays, however, the high
                                pressure politics of Germany, Italy, and Japan were pinpricking
                                Britain at points all over the political chessboard whereat British
                                interests crossed those of the other three countries. The Minister
                                reiterated with emphasis his opinion that under present
                                circumstances Britain was not in a position to handle effectively
                                the situations in the West and the East at the same time. Therefore
                                an Anglo-Japanese agreement in the Far East might give Britain a
                                freer hand to concentrate her efforts in the West. The Minister then
                                significantly mentioned that he would be greatly interested to
                                ascertain what American official attitude might be towards a
                                possible Anglo-Jap agreement.</p>
                            <p>The Minister’s manifested interest on this score discloses, to my
                                mind, his present efforts to appraise at long range the potential
                                turn of events in the Far East, in the light of their bearing upon
                                affairs in Western Europe, and upon Poland’s position in particular.
                                Accordingly, I interpret his aforementioned interest to mean that he
                                is <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0416"/>now undoubtedly planning
                                Poland’s course for the next few months. He must therefore take into
                                consideration the possible outcome of events in the Far East.
                                Accordingly, I perceive Beck feels that if the United States were
                                not actively to oppose an Anglo-Japanese accord, such an accord
                                might augur an eventual free hand for Japan vis-à-vis Soviet Russia,
                                which in turn might hamper the Soviet’s ability to cooperate
                                effectively with Poland in protecting the Soviet’s and Poland’s
                                respective Ukrainian minorities against German pressure. In such
                                case, as well as in the event of British and French continued
                                disinterest in Eastern Europe, Poland might be afforded no “out”
                                from what might appear to be its only alternative, namely,
                                collaboration with Germany in the setting up of an independent
                                Ukrainian state at the expense of Polish, the Soviet’s and Rumania’s
                                Ukrainian minorities.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, I perceive Beck feels that if the United States
                                were to oppose actively an Anglo-Japanese agreement, Japan’s hand
                                would not be free to act against the Soviet—at least for some time
                                to come. Hence, in turn, Moscow might be freer to attend (<hi
                                    rend="italic">a</hi>) to a much needed reconsolidation of the
                                Soviet’s internal structure, and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) to the
                                protection of the Soviet’s Ukrainian minority against German
                                machinations. In this case Poland might conceivably be afforded
                                effective Soviet collaboration in protecting their respective
                                Ukrainian minorities, and in such light a possible “out” from
                                aforementioned forced collaboration with Germany.</p>
                            <p>Of pertinent bearing on the substance of Minister Beck’s aforecited
                                remarks, his Chief of Cabinet, Count Lubienski, who joined our
                                conversation, stated that his recent talk with an American
                                journalist disclosed the latter’s opinion that American public
                                opinion would be resentful of an exclusively Anglo-Jap agreement
                                with regard to their respective interests in China. In response,
                                Minister Beck significantly said that this opinion recalled to his
                                mind the expressed opinion of former Japanese Minister to Poland,
                                Hito, to effect that Japan was making a great mistake in attacking
                                China first—she should have gone after Soviet Russia in the first
                                instance—China later. Japan would undoubtedly encounter a longer
                                campaign in China than expected; in such case, a consequent drain on
                                the Japanese Army’s strength and Tokyo’s treasury, potential
                                provocation of anti-Jap feeling among the democracies, and other
                                world events of direct or indirect unfavorable bearing on Japan’s
                                position during a protracted campaign might conceivably play in
                                Moscow’s ultimate favor.</p>

                                        consular officers should avoid any action which might imply

                                        need of the maintenance of the very complicated relations,
                                        the Department suggested that calls might be received and
                                        returned by sending or by taking in person if deemed

                                        Department declared that it does not deem it practicable to

                                Power rights and interests in China”, will probably not reassure
                                Occidental businessmen interested in the Central China market. Local
                                American businessmen consider that Japanese restrictions on their
                                freedom of movement and on their trading activities in the Shanghai
                                hinterland have already deprived them of many of their rights and
                                interests.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kodama also stated that the Central China Development Company
                                “desires to be the guiding factor in the economic reconstruction
                                work of Central China by financing and managing the fundamental
                                enterprises for production and trade.” If this goal is achieved, the
                                Central China Development Company will probably control most of the
                                manufacturing and trade in the Yangtze Valley.</p>
                            <p>So far as this office knows, no non-Japanese individual or
                                organization has yet indicated any desire to invest in the
                                subsidiaries of the Central China Development Company. The
                                possibility that these firms may function more to aid Japanese
                                economic penetration into Central China than for profit, and lack of
                                confidence in the future value of the Yen may act as deterrents to
                                any such investments. Hence, it will not be surprising if Mr.
                                Kodama’s hope for the investment of foreign capital in the
                                subsidiaries of the Central China Development Company is not
                                fulfilled.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kodama is quoted as saying to reporters upon his arrival at
                                    Shanghai,<note n="†" xml:id="d394fn64">See Enclosure No. 1.
                                    [Footnote in the original; enclosure not printed.]</note> “I
                                intend to look about so as to formulate an idea of the existing
                                situation.” He and his party planned to proceed to Nanking on
                                November 30, 1938, for a two day visit. No announcement of his
                                return to Shanghai has come to the attention of this office and it
                                is believed that his visit up the Yangtze River has been
                                extended.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kodama’s statement contains little that is new, and Occidentals
                                in Shanghai, who fear the effects of this firm and its subsidiaries
                                upon their businesses, find nothing encouraging therein.</p>

                            <p>588. Following is Embassy’s translation of a third person note
                                received from Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs under date of
                                November 29: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs presents its compliments to
                                        the American Embassy and, with reference to the forcible
                                        attempts of Japan to seize the various Chinese courts in the
                                        Concession areas at Shanghai, has the honor to recall that
                                        the Ministry has repeatedly discussed the matter with His
                                        Excellency Nelson Trusler Johnson, American Ambassador, as
                                        well as having detailed officials to proceed to the Embassy
                                        to conduct negotiations. The request to adopt a stern
                                        attitude firmly rejecting Japanese interference has already
                                        aroused the attention of the American Embassy.</p>
                                    <p>The establishment of the Chinese courts in question and the
                                        exercise of their functions are based upon international
                                        agreements signed by the various powers concerned; they
                                        possess an intimate relation to the peace of the
                                        Concessions. Once they are seized by Japan, not only will
                                        Chinese citizens in the Concessions be exposed to danger,
                                        but also foreign nationals without extra-territorial rights
                                        and even foreigners with extra-territorial rights, will be
                                        greatly threatened; in fact, this would amount to control of
                                        the whole of the Concessions and cannot be regarded with
                                        indifference.</p>
                                    <p>The confidential report has recently been received to the
                                        effect that Japan’s attempts forcibly to seize the various
                                        Chinese courts in the Concessions at Shanghai have been more
                                        intensified, and there is talk that it will occupy Hongkew
                                        as a <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> for the taking over
                                        of the courts. If this information is true, it is thought
                                        that the various parties affected will be able to foresee
                                        the consequences. The Ministry has the honor, therefore,
                                        especially to request that the American Embassy take note of
                                        the matter and that it continue to adhere to its previous
                                        policy in relation to the Chinese courts of exhausting all
                                        efforts for their protection; that is, that it firmly reject
                                        Japan’s illegal interference, in order to uphold
                                        international agreements. The Ministry is appreciative of
                                        the Embassy’s friendliness in the matter.”</p>

                            <p>I am driven to the conclusion that much of what is being done by “the
                                Japanese authorities” in China<note n="61" xml:id="d396fn61">See

                                instance of and by order of the Army and the Navy without any
                                particular reference to or instruction or authorization of the “home
                                government” in Tokyo; in other words, that there are for practical
                                purposes now two Japanese Governments, one in Japan and the other in
                                China, the one in Japan being parent to and ally and associate of
                                the one in China but being possessed of much less than absolute
                                authority over and control of its offspring. This situation makes
                                matters increasingly difficult for all concerned—except the
                                headstrong Japanese offspring, their naval and military authorities
                                in China. It also increases the chances of foreign powers (both
                                governments and peoples) being fooled by assurances given by the
                                Japanese Government in Japan.</p>

                                    silence maintained by the Japanese press on this subject make it

                                    assimilated the existing regimes at Peiping and Nanking. Sawada
                                    said that all negotiations with Wu have ceased, that Wu is not
                                    popular in Central and South China and that there is available
                                    no Chinese who would receive as Chief of Government general
                                    support in all Japanese occupied parts of China. He further said
                                    that the Foreign Office envisages the establishment of local
                                    governments additional to those already set up and the linking
                                    together of these governments by a “Central Committee” the

                            <p>722. 1. The Counselor of the Japanese Embassy volunteered last night
                                the following statement to an officer of this Embassy: <list>
                                    <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                    <item>He hoped that the current conversations between the
                                        Japanese Foreign Minister and our Ambassador in Tokyo would
                                        soon reach a solution; he felt that a solution would be
                                        possible if the American Government did not “hold too
                                        closely to the Stimson policy”.</item>
                                    <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                    <item>The Japanese military considered that policy intolerable
                                        and progress could be achieved only by “backing away from it
                                        somewhat”.</item>
                                    <label>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)</label>
                                    <item>The Japanese Government had much appreciated American
                                        attitude in North China which was an area to which the
                                        Japanese attach great importance.</item>
                                    <label>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>)</label>
                                    <item>When we were fairminded and patient in regard to
                                        happenings in North China the news spread very quickly and
                                        had a noticeable effect upon the Japanese military and
                                        others in Japan;</item>

                                    <item>Conversely a stiffer attitude would have an unfavorable
                                        effect;</item>
                                    <label>(<hi rend="italic">f</hi>)</label>
                                    <item>For example while he found it possible “to mitigate” the
                                        difficulties caused by incidents involving Japanese military
                                        and Americans he had failed to accomplish anything in
                                        respect to incidents involving British subjects because he
                                        had to inform the military that British diplomatic officers
                                        adopted an unbending attitude toward Anglo-Japanese
                                        problems.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>2. The Counselor also offered a long dissertation on economic and
                                trade problems the burden of which was that trade control was
                                absolutely necessary for China, but was not necessarily
                                discriminatory.</p>
                            <p>3. In a separate conversation the Japanese First Secretary stated to
                                the American Secretary that (1) he was heartily sick of his work
                                here; (2) he was no longer a diplomatic officer but an attaché of
                                the Japanese military; (3) his Embassy had to consult the military
                                in regard to every matter that arose between his Embassy and the
                                American and British Embassies; (4) in addition various Japanese
                                military officers concocted “ridiculous economic schemes” with which
                                they burdened the Japanese Embassy; (5) for example, he himself was
                                now wasting a great deal of time investigating, at the insistence of
                                the Japanese military, the means and cost of softening North China’s
                                notoriously hard water; (6) foolishness of this sort found a
                                corollary in the political field; (7) for example Japanese plans for
                                a new central government for China, including the plan to make Wu
                                Fei Fu President, were now topsy turvy and hopelessly confused.</p>

                            <p>786. 1. During the last few days the Japanese papers have given much
                                space to despatches from London and Washington to the effect that
                                economic reprisals by the United States and Great Britain against
                                Japan are being given active consideration and to feature articles
                                on this subject apparently as a result of the Foreign Office or some
                                other official source as they contain points not mentioned in
                                published press despatches. References are being made to the return
                                of Ambassadors Johnson and Kennedy,<note n="64" xml:id="d400fn64"

                                reported approaching American credit loan to China, et cetera, as
                                indications of the trend of official American and British

                                unusually well informed states that the Department is now studying
                                the possibility of restricting or excluding imports from Japan on
                                the basis of section 338 of the Tariff Act, that evidence is
                                accumulating of Anglo-American discussions looking towards
                                concerting reprisal measures, and that the Japanese Ambassadors at
                                Washington and London have been instructed to ascertain the
                                intentions of the American and British Governments. It further
                                states that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will shortly resume his
                                conversations with Craigie and me and that after further expounding
                                the Japanese thesis he will urge “reconsideration of plans for
                                Anglo-American economic sanctions against Japan”.</p>
                            <p>3. Although these articles stress that Japan will not completely
                                close the door in China their tone is not compromising.</p>

                                reportedly preparing for a drive through West Suiyuan and south from
                                Wuyuan, Suiyuan, through Ninghsia to Lanchow, as part of its effort

                                air raids against Wuyuan and Ningyuan are cited by some foreign

                                Shansi which has so far failed to materialize because the Japanese

                            <p>729. The formation of a Sino-Japanese aviation company, the China
                                Aviation Company, with services projected for Peiping–Shanghai,
                                Shanghai–Hankow, Shanghai–Canton, Peiping-Dairen and Peiping–Tatung,
                                was announced here on December 17th. The capital of the new company
                                is reportedly to be jointly invested by Peiping Provisional, the
                                Nanking Reformed and the Mongolian Autonomous Governments, the Hui
                                Tung and the Japan Air Transport Companies, the capital to be 6
                                million yen of which the three Governments will contribute only
                                250,000 each. As the managing director and other high officials as
                                well as a great part of the personnel are to be Japanese and as
                                participation in the investment is said to be small and restricted
                                to the above official bodies, the new company may be considered as a
                                further monopolistic venture on the part of the Japanese envisaged
                                by and within the framework of the North China Development Company.
                                The Hui Tung Company organized in 1936 will be merged into the new
                                company.</p>

                            <p>610. The Embassy learns from reliable sources that the Generalissimo
                                at a meeting, convoked on December 18, issued a forceful rebuke to
                                the civil officials of the National Government for what he termed
                                their frivolous attitude, inefficiency, corruption and waste in the
                                face of a grave national crisis and pointing to life being led by
                                the soldiers in the field, strongly admonished his listeners to be
                                diligent, honest, eschew all amusements, and in short to pull

                            <p>87. On morning of December 20th a Canton Peace Maintenance Commission
                                was installed under Japanese auspices at Canton in ceremony at Sun
                                Yat Sen Memorial Hall with former Sim Yat Sen associates Peng Tung
                                Yuan as chairman and Lu Chun Yu as vice chairman. About 5,000
                                Chinese of poorer classes, many presumably assembled under Japanese
                                direction, attending [<hi rend="italic">attended?</hi>] the meeting,
                                where Japanese and “5 barred” flags were displayed and at which
                                Japanese military, naval, consular and newly installed Chinese
                                “Commission” officials urged cooperation with new regime.
                                Congratulatory telegrams from Japanese officials in Tokyo and
                                members of Japanese sponsored regimes in Manchuria, Peiping and
                                Nanking were read. The German Vice Consul attended formally attired,
                                but, except for French Vice Consul who was present unofficially, no
                                other consular officers attended.</p>
                            <p>Following inaugural ceremony there was a parade through Canton
                                streets of Japanese Army trucks carrying apathetic looking Chinese
                                holding flags; there were armed Japanese guards in many of the
                                trucks.</p>

                                        <item>In view of the unofficial nature of the Foreign
                                            Minister’s memorandum (of December 8) which was probably
                                            intended to test our reactions, no official
                                            representations should be made as coming from the
                                            British Government but an early opportunity should be
                                            taken to indicate that profound dissatisfaction has been
                                            caused in England by the Minister’s expressed views. If
                                            these views were to become known to the public they
                                            would tend to increase the already mounting distrust and
                                            misgiving resulting from recent press articles outlining
                                            Japanese intentions;</item>

                                        <item>British inability to agree to arbitrary and unilateral

                                            revision by discussion if he desires to do so. The onus
                                            to make first proposals would thus be placed on
                                            Japan;</item>

                                        <item>Lord Elibank, who is not a member of the Government,
                                            characterized Japanese actions in China as “economic
                                            aggression” and advocated certain measures of economic
                                            retaliation. We deplore practice of Japanese news
                                            agencies and press of divorcing from their context
                                            statements by public men in England in order to create
                                            ill-feeling in Japan. Any acts of economic retaliation
                                            which are advocated or contemplated arise from failure
                                            of Japanese to implement previous assurances. Such acts
                                            of retaliation do not furnish excuse for further
                                            Japanese acts of discrimination and exclusion. The
                                            impulse to advocate retaliatory measures would
                                            automatically disappear if causes of just complaints in
                                            China were removed and a definite forward step would
                                            have been taken in improving our mutual relations.
                                            British Government has up till now exercised great
                                            restraint in replying to questions in Parliament but
                                            will be unable indefinitely to restrain public opinion
                                            in view of growing mistrust. If any gesture is called
                                            for Japan should surely take the initiative;</item>

                                            used against necessity for monopolistic control in China
                                            might well be amplified. In time of war no power except
                                            China could prevent Japan’s access to raw materials in
                                            that country. To assume the contrary would presuppose a
                                            defeated Japan whose communications with China were
                                            severed and in that event Japanese control and ownership
                                            would be of no avail. No argument therefore exists for
                                            departing from principle of equal opportunity. The only
                                            requirements are an independent, stable and well
                                            disposed China, free from domination by any power, and a
                                            powerful and undefeated Japan. Community interests of
                                            many powers in China should be welcomed as a stabilizing
                                            factor which would in no way obstruct Japanese aim to
                                            secure necessary raw materials. (End resume of Craigie’s

                                    adequately presented and recorded and that in the light of the
                                    present attitude of the Japanese Government nothing was to be

                                    debate over the same points and issues. I said I felt that the

                                    and that while I would continue at every opportunity to maintain
                                    the position of my Government, as already fully expressed to the
                                    Japanese Government both orally and in writing, I felt that a
                                    dignified reserve was now desirable while awaiting the
                                    development of the many factors which are constantly at work in

                                <item>Craigie was impressed by this attitude but he nevertheless
                                    believes that the present situation is inviolable and while he
                                    is emphatically in favor of economic measures of pressure he
                                    feels that a “safety valve” would be afforded by a continuance
                                    of friendly debate with the Foreign Minister with regard to the
                                    practical application of the “new order”. Craigie says that he
                                    has reason to believe that the army is interested only in
                                    securing permanent access to raw materials and that the pressure
                                    on the Government to exclude foreign trade in general from China
                                    springs from other, non military, elements. (I myself fed it
                                    very difficult to accept this hypothesis.)</item>

                                <item>I may add that Craigie in this and in previous conversations
                                    has been unable to suppress a latent eagerness to find a
                                    compromise settlement with the Japanese on the basis of (<hi
                                        rend="italic">a</hi>) satisfying Japanese plans for the
                                    development of sources of raw material in China and (<hi
                                        rend="italic">b</hi>) non-impairment of British and other
                                    foreign trading rights in China. His opinion, as reported in the
                                    second sentence of paragraph 5, was fathered, I believe, more by
                                    this eagerness than by any conclusive indication of the Japanese
                                    Army’s exclusive interest in raw materials. In the light of
                                    Craigie’s thoughts on this point, I am apprehensive of embarking
                                    on discussions along the lines suggested in paragraph &amp; of
                                    his instructions.</item>

                                <item>As a result of our talk today Craigie will, unless called for
                                    by Arita, postpone visiting the Minister until after the
                                    holidays. He expressed the hope, however, that I would inform
                                    him of any reply received from Washington to my present telegram
                                    in order that he might explain to his Government his own

                                northern Kwangtung were thereby prevented. However, this diversion

                                say:</p>
                            <p>I concur in the lines of reasoning on which this memorandum moves,
                                and I have no criticism of or comment to offer upon what appears in
                                the first twenty pages. With regard to the statement in conclusion
                                (pages 21–25), I concur in the views there expressed except as
                                indicated hereunder:</p>
                            <p>I share the view that “a comprehensive and thoroughgoing program of
                                retaliation is not desirable at this time”; but I would underscore
                                the words “at this time”, and I would add that I consider it highly
                                desirable that a plan be made at this time for a comprehensive and
                                thoroughgoing program of measures of material pressure which might
                                be applied, beginning with some one step and proceeding as the
                                situation may unfold to other steps, by way of preparation for
                                action which might soon need to be begun.</p>
                            <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0430"/>
                            <p>I dissent from the view that “Such a program of retaliation <hi
                                    rend="underline">would</hi> [underscoring mine] involve serious
                                risk of armed conflict.” My view is that adoption of such a program,
                                and letting it be known that the program is in existence and may be
                                carried out, <hi rend="underline">might</hi> contribute
                                substantially toward obviating the development of a situation in
                                which danger of armed conflict would become an actuality. I grant
                                that the formulation of such a program <hi rend="underline"
                                    >might</hi> create a risk. But I think that continuance of this
                                Government’s part of acquiescence in Japan’s impairment of our
                                rights and destruction of our interests in China is more sure to
                                contribute to the creation of a risk than would be the adoption by
                                this Government of a program of resistance to Japan by means qf
                                material pressures. In my opinion, unlawful and aggressive acts
                                cannot anywhere be opposed—even by words alone—without some degree
                                of risk arising. It is my conviction, however, that resolute
                                opposition is less dangerous than timorous opposition or
                                acquiescence; and I believe that a bold stand by the American
                                Government would on the one hand have very prompt support from the
                                American public and on the other hand have a definite though not
                                conclusively determining effect toward deterring the Japanese from
                                going to extremes.</p>
                            <p>I dissent from the view that “wholehearted international cooperation,
                                especially on the part of the British Empire, would be necessary, to
                                accomplish the objectives in mind …”<note n="70" xml:id="d409fn70"
                                    >Omission indicated in the original.</note> To begin with, the
                                immediate objective is to prevent the Japanese from taking extreme
                                action against our rights and interests (along with those of other
                                powers) in China. The more remote, as contrasted with the immediate,
                                objective is to prevent a collapse of Chinese resistance to Japan
                                and the concomitant of an early military victory by the Japanese
                                which would place them for the time being in unopposed military
                                occupation of the whole of China. Sharing the view that “close and
                                thoroughgoing European cooperation” cannot be secured, I
                                nevertheless do not believe that such cooperation is
                                necessary—provided the United States would take and would make clear
                                that it had taken and would continue in a determined position of
                                refusal either to assent to or to acquiesce in disregard of its
                                rights and destruction of its interests in China. This country has
                                the capacity and it could be brought to have the will to bring to
                                bear upon Japan material pressures of such weight that the Japanese,
                                contemplating the prospect of those pressures being applied, would
                                very substantially modify the program to which they have recently
                                and openly declared themselves committed.</p>
                            <p>I find the suggestion, but absence of a recommendation, that endeavor
                                might be made now to obtain revision of Section 338 of the <pb
                                    n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0431"/>Tariff Act of 1930 on lines
                                indicated; also, that possible denunciation of the commercial treaty
                                of 1911 might be considered. I would go further. I would urge that
                                the first of these suggestions be acted upon forthwith. I would urge
                                that a decision be made that denunciation of the treaty of 1911 be
                                authorized, now, notification to be given if, when and as
                                developments in the situation may be such as to lead to the
                                conclusion that the moment is opportune and the act desirable.</p>

                            <p>613. The Embassy is reliably informed that Wang Ching Wei left
                                Chungking for Yunnanfu December 19 and that he has since gone to
                                Hanoi where he is remaining indefinitely. It is reported that his
                                sudden and secret departure is attributable to a growing rift
                                between him and H. H. Kung which is said to have originated at the
                                Chungking session of the People’s Political Council during which
                                Kung was roundly criticized. Kung is reported to believe that Wang
                                Ching Wei is directly or indirectly responsible for the attacks
                                launched upon him.</p>
                            <p>It is believed unlikely in local circles that Wang Ching Wei will
                                return to Chungking so long as Kung who is reported to be unpopular
                                in most official quarters remains in office. However, it is doubtful
                                whether the Generalissimo can be prevailed upon to relieve Kung of
                                his official duties particularly in view of family relationships and
                                in the face of recent financial arrangements. There is no suggestion
                                locally that Wang Ching Wei’s departure can be construed as
                                indicative of a design to align himself with Japan or with puppet
                                organizations.</p>

                            <p rend="flushleft">It is generally agreed that these peace terms, along
                                with disclaimer of intention to demand indemnity from China and to
                                seize any part of China, should effectively convince the United
                                States and Great Britain that “the lawful activities in China of

                                Japanese peace conditions are to be carried out, and it is concerned
                                lest the full expectations of Japan be misunderstood. It stresses
                                that the basic principle of the “new order” policy is to eradicate
                                completely those “conditions which place China under European and
                                American dominance”, and it hopes that this point will be emphasized

                                in the direction of moderation, by adverse reaction abroad to

                                        that Japan will endeavor to bring about a settlement of the
                                        conflict on the basis of the terms set forth in the

                                utterances, is that, being couched in too general terms and hedged
                                about with qualifying clauses, it commits Japan to nothing specific.
                                We believe that it has been thus framed to permit Japan all possible
                                latitude to move as circumstances warrant. The peace terms, as such,
                                are not new and, in the absence of a concrete plan for
                                implementation, cannot be appraised. It will be, of course, the
                                guarantees which will be demanded from China for the latter’s
                                observance of these terms, that will actually define them.</p>
                            <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0433"/>
                            <p>5. The question, to whom is the statement addressed, naturally
                                arises. We do not believe that it was addressed primarily to the
                                Chinese Government, although it might be supposed that it was
                                formulated partly with an eye to encouraging those elements in the
                                Chinese Government which are reported to be weary of the conflict.
                                Again, it was probably intended to provide a means by which the
                                regimes in China might observe the proprieties in accepting the
                                Japanese terms. However, it would seem to us that the audience which
                                the Japanese Government had chiefly in mind was the United States
                                and Great Britain. The moderate language of the statement and the
                                tone of the press comment both suggest that the statement was
                                intended as an invitation to these countries to explore ultimate
                                Japanese intentions.</p>

                                was much talk in Japan, in the press and elsewhere, of the
                                formulation of a fundamental policy toward China. Various leaders
                                and various governmental bodies were reported to have the problem
                                under consideration, though only the most generalized statements
                                with regard to what was going on were obtainable. On the evening of
                                November 28 the Cabinet gave out a statement (Embassy’s telegram
                                755, November 29, 5 p.m.) to the effect that “The Cabinet this

                                    Times</hi> ran a special story about Wu Pei-fu in which the
                                statement was made that “Some <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430"
                                    facs="0434"/>observers predict that he may consent to become
                                ‘President of the Federal Republic of China’ in the areas now under
                                Japanese occupation.” Other papers carried similar articles. A few
                                days later it was given out to the press that the Premier would make
                                a declaration of major importance in a speech at Osaka on December
                                11 which would be broadcast widely. When that date arrived a press
                                release said that the Premier would not be able to make the trip
                                because of ill health; and on December 12 the press was officially
                                informed that the declaration had been indefinitely postponed.</p>
                            <p>Meantime information from various sources was leading the Embassy to
                                believe that the conference in the presence of the Emperor as well
                                as the other discussions within the government conducted in such
                                secrecy had had to do at least in part with efforts to establish in
                                China a new regime, nominally led by Chinese, for the governing of
                                the occupied areas. This belief was in considerable part borne out
                                and conlirmed by statements made to the Counselor of the Embassy by
                                the Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs on December 13 (Embassy’s
                                telegram 783, December 14, 5 p.m.). The Vice Minister stated
                                confidentially and off the record that the Foreign Office believes
                                that the refusal of Wu Pei-fu to become head of the new government
                                which had been proposed is in reality a blessing for Japan. He gave
                                it as the opinion of the Foreign Office that a federated form of
                                government is the most promising form of government for China, not a
                                regime made over from the union of the Nanking and Peking groups.
                                The Vice Minister further gave an intimation of the system of
                                government envisaged for China by the Foreign Office when he
                                referred to the possibility of establishment of a central committee
                                the members of which would represent a large number of local
                                governments additional to those already set up, a chairman being
                                elected from among the members of the committee.</p>
                            <p>On the evening of December 22 the Premier gave out an important

                                was given to understand at the time of the release that the
                                conditions had been approved by the November 30 conference in the
                                presence of the Emperor.</p>
                            <p>It seems probable that when the November 30 conference made its
                                decisions of basic policy toward China it also approved the
                                recognition of a government of China for the occupied areas,
                                probably to be headed by Wu Pei-fu. Obviously the recognition of an
                                established regime at the same time as the announcement of basic
                                policy as conditions governing the relations of Japan with the newly
                                established <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0435"/>regime would
                                have offered to the Japanese public and to the foreign world a
                                dramatic development, and there seems little doubt that, had Wu
                                Pei-fu been cooperative, such would have been the result. Wu
                                Pei-fu’s refusal then apparently caused postponement of announcement
                                even of the basic conditions approved by the November 30 conference,
                                in the hope that some new solution for setting up a government of
                                China might be found. By December 22 it was nevertheless found
                                advisable to announce the basic conditions without taking
                                simultaneous action in recognition of a regime.</p>
                            <p>Piecing together the fragments of information which have come to the
                                Embassy’s attention in explanation of this sequence of happenings,
                                the Embassy inclines to the view that General Doihara was sponsor of
                                a plan for installing Wu Pei-fu as head of a single government for
                                the occupied areas of China; that General Kita was sponsor of a plan
                                for installing Wang Keh-min as head of such government; that General
                                Doihara was able to win the support of the Japanese Government to
                                his plan; that the plan miscarried on account of Wu Pei-fu’s refusal
                                to cooperate; that the establishing of a single regime for the
                                governing of the occupied areas has had to be deferred and is now
                                not being actively pressed; and that the present prospect is for a
                                loosely federated form of government, without a dominating
                                individual Chinese leader. A fair assumption is that, as Japanese
                                pressure for the immediate setting up of a government has apparently
                                relaxed, the December 22 announcement of basic conditions,
                                separately from any act of recognizing of a regime, is further
                                indication that the setting up of a single government is not
                                imminently expected.</p>

                                administrative officer. General Yanagawa has been appointed to this
                                important position.</p>
                            <p>The general organization of this board largely conforms to that of
                                former projected organizations which have been fully reported to the
                                Department by various despatches, particularly my No. 3300, October
                                4, and there is little additional comment which can be made at this
                                time. It may be, however, of some significance to point out the
                                extensive preparations for the establishment of “affiliated offices”
                                in China, a liaison committee for the purpose of facilitating unity
                                in the policies of the various Government offices regarding China
                                and the provision for the participation in the work of the Asia
                                Promotion Board by Army and Navy officers on the active list, such
                                officers to retain their active service standing. The strong
                                position held by the military in relation to the Asia Board is
                                evidenced by the appointment of General Yanagawa, General Suzuki,
                                and other military officers to important positions. It is yet too
                                early to predict to what extent the supervision by the Cabinet will
                                be effective, or whether the scope of this Board may be broadened
                                until it equals or surpasses a ministry in importance.</p>
                            <p>The progress in the organization of this central organ has been very
                                slow, however, during the latter part of November, it was announced
                                that the Cabinet had finally approved the proposed organization of
                                an official organ for the control of relations with China and that
                                the name to be adopted would be the Koa-in (Asia Promotion Board).
                                On December 2, it was reported that the Privy Council had approved
                                the draft plan, but at the same time had attached a statement of
                                “its hopes” to the effect that the greatest consideration be given
                                to the functioning of the Board, the selection of its personnel, and
                                the relations between the Board and “local agencies”, and further
                                    <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0437"/>that every care be
                                taken to avoid friction with the diplomatic authorities. The
                                Committee’s approval was followed shortly thereafter by the formal
                                approval of the Privy Council and the Imperial Ordinances were
                                promulgated on December 16. The Board reportedly began functioning
                                immediately. While the Imperial Ordinance states that the Board is
                                to function “during the China Incident”, a Government spokesman
                                reportedly stated in reply to a question posed by the Privy Council
                                Committee that the end of the China incident will be fixed by
                                Imperial decision and that the Asia Promotion Board may exist even
                                if the emergency is brought to an end. It is also obvious from
                                various press reports of Government statements that the emergency
                                will not be considered to have ended with the termination of active
                                hostilities but that the necessity for such organizations as the
                                Asia Promotion Board will continue until Japan’s policies and
                                programs for a new order in East Asia have been realized. This has
                                been interpreted by Government spokesmen to mean until the program
                                for the reconstruction and development of China and the economic,
                                political, and cultural cooperation of Japan, “Manchukuo” and China
                                has been effected.</p>

                                    <p>“The latest statement by Prince Konoye is in no wise
                                        different from previous declarations made by the Japanese
                                        Government. It thus shows that the basic policy of Japan,
                                        namely, the policy of destroying the independence and
                                        integrity of China and of closing the Open Door in this
                                        country, has remained unchanged.</p>
                                    <p>Prince Konoye professes, on the one hand, the respect of his
                                        Government for the sovereignty of China, but, on the other,
                                        he announces the determination of Japan to continue her
                                        military operations in China, to consolidate the puppet
                                        regimes set up by the Japanese Army, and to force China into
                                        signing an anti-communist pact. His declared objects falsify
                                        the avowed intention of his Government to respect the
                                        sovereignty of China.</p>
                                    <p>While declaring that Japan has no territorial designs on
                                        China, Prince Konoye demands in the same breath the right to
                                        station troops in China and the transformation of inner
                                        Mongolia into a so-called <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434"
                                            facs="0438"/>‘special anti-communist district.’ Such,
                                        demands constitute but a disguised attempt at the political
                                        dismemberment of China.</p>
                                    <p>With regard to the so-called rights of domicile and trade in
                                        the interior of China, the Japanese desire may appear to be
                                        harmless on the surface. But if one were to consider the
                                        presence of Japanese troops in China and their domination of
                                        the puppet government, it should not be difficult to
                                        visualize Japan’s true intentions in this country. That is
                                        to say, Japan is intent on using her military forces and the
                                        bogus regimes to push with all her might a comprehensive
                                        scheme of economic penetration covering the whole of China
                                        and exclusively for Japan’s own interest. This line of
                                        action is identical with that followed in her exploitation
                                        of Manchuria.</p>
                                    <p>The declaration that Japan does not wish to monopolize the
                                        economic rights in China now to restrict the economic
                                        interests of third powers, is entirely insincere, being
                                        merely intended to ease the international atmosphere which
                                        has become increasingly unfavorable to her. One needs only
                                        to look at the present condition of the so-called
                                        ‘Manchukuo’ and the recent Japanese economic establishments
                                        in China as well as the extent of destruction of third power
                                        interests to realize that Japan’s declaration is not to be
                                        trusted.”</p>

                            <p>619. The Embassy is reliably informed that prior to coming to
                                Chungking on or about December 10 the Generalissimo went to South
                                China where he convoked a conference which was attended by over 200
                                ranking officers and at which detailed plans were formulated for the
                                defense of northern Kwangtung and of Kwangsi. Chang Fa Kwei was
                                designated as Commander-in-Chief of the South China forces with Yu
                                Han Mou and Li Han Hun, newly appointed Kwangtung Provincial
                                Government Chairman, as vice commanders. The South China forces are
                                reported to comprise 28 regular divisions including 6 central, 12
                                Cantonese and 10 Kwangsi, in addition to a formidable auxiliary
                                force in the Self Defense Corps. It is anticipated that no serious
                                effort will be made to defend the coastal areas adjacent to Pakhoi
                                and Kwangchowwan or even Nanning and this whole area is now being
                                laid waste and the inhabitants required to evacuate in order to
                                impede Japanese military operations. However, it is expected <pb
                                    n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0439"/>that strong resistance will
                                be offered if the Japanese endeavor to penetrate deeply into
                                Kwangsi.</p>
                            <p>Repeated to Peiping for Tokyo.</p>
                            <p>Chiang Kai Shek left Chungking December 20 to investigate military
                                conditions at Sian and other points in the northwest. It is reported
                                that he will soon return to Chungking. In this connection it is
                                learned that the Chinese will make no strong effort to hold their
                                present Yellow River defenses or Sian, although Hanchung in South
                                Shensi will be defended by powerful forces the nucleus of which is
                                said to be composed of 11 intact and well trained divisions under
                                the command of General Hu Tsung Nan.</p>
                            <p>It is generally believed in Chungking that the failure of the
                                Japanese military to follow up the capture of Hankow with a
                                concerted drive on Changsha and Hengyang, the center of Chinese
                                resistance in Central China, constituted a repetition of the costly
                                error in strategy committed during the fall of Nanking. The Embassy
                                has received information from official and private sources which
                                discloses that the Chinese military forces were badly demoralized
                                during the fall of Wuhan and Canton and that the Japanese would have
                                met with negligible resistance if they had continued to advance
                                beyond Yochow. However, the present “breathing spell” has enabled
                                the Generalissimo to reorganize his forces and it is generally
                                believed that Japanese penetration into western Hunan and Hupeh will
                                meet with firm resistance.</p>
                            <p>To the failure of the Japanese to press the military advantages
                                accruing from the fall of Wuhan and Canton [may be?] added another
                                factor of vital import to China’s resistance: namely, the granting
                                of American credits to China and reports of similar British action
                                have been construed by the Chinese as indicating the commencement of
                                action by those powers to prevent Japan from achieving its aims in
                                the Far East, and it now seems clear that this conviction has
                                immensely stimulated and stiffened the Chinese will for prolonged
                                    resistance.<note n="79" xml:id="d415fn79">See <ref

                            <p>622. My 618, December 24, noon. The Chinese press and Central News
                                Agency today published an incomplete version of a speech attributed
                                to General Chiang Kai Shek which was delivered at the weekly
                                memorial meeting of the Central Tangpu in Chungking on December
                                26.</p>
                            <p>General Chiang is reported to have referred to the recent statement
                                of the Japanese Prime Minister as a disclosure of Japanese intrigue
                                aimed at the dismemberment of China and to have stated that this and
                                other recent Japanese official utterances have served to give the
                                Chinese people a deeper understanding of Japanese ambitions and have
                                thereby strengthened the determination of the Chinese people to
                                continue resistance without surrender or compromise.</p>
                            <p>He is also said to have stated that Minister Wang Ching Wei went to
                                Hanoi for medical treatment, that Japanese and German rumors that he
                                is on a mission on behalf of the National Government to discuss
                                peace terms with the Japanese are entirely false and that Mister
                                Wang’s trip has not the slightest connection with National
                                Government or party affairs. General Chiang is quoted as having
                                alluded to Mister Wang’s meritorious service to the state and to
                                have expressed the hope that if Mister Wang had his own views on
                                national policy he should feel free to return and to discuss them
                                with members of the Government and the party.</p>

                                            that the British Government’s declared intention to
                                            examine sympathetically China’s request for financial
                                            assistance, and British desire to achieve an equitable
                                            settlement of the Sino-Japanese conflict were mutually
                                            contradictory. In view of the precarious position of the
                                            Chiang Kai Shek government and its inability to offer
                                            substantial security, any loan to China in the present
                                            circumstances assumed a political significance. Craigie
                                            insisted that the British credit extension to China was
                                            a purely commercial transaction, and that to refuse such
                                            commercial arrangements with China would be incompatible
                                            with the maintenance of neutrality.</item>

                                    brought out in paragraph 6 of my 795, is as follows: <quote
                                        rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>“His Excellency seemed particularly interested in my
                                            slightly elaborated version of paragraph 4 of your
                                            telegram No. 800 and admitted that Japan’s primary
                                            concern was to develop in China the raw materials of
                                            which she had special need and the trades connected
                                            therewith. I suggested that it should surely be possible
                                            to evolve some means of doing this without treading on
                                            anybody’s toes and with the willing assent of the
                                            Chinese Government. I still could not understand why His
                                            Excellency thought it necessary to spoil his case by
                                            threatening trade discrimination even though at the
                                            moment we were only being shown the thin end of the
                                            wedge. Mr. Arita would not admit that his instrument was
                                            a wedge and expressed hope that if I had any suggestion
                                            to make by which Japan could attain her legitimate needs
                                            without any departure from the principle of equality of
                                            opportunity, he hoped I would not hesitate to make
                                            it.[”]</p>

                            <p>1500. Domei News Agency quotes a statement reportedly issued by the
                                Japanese expeditionary forces in Central China which the agency
                                characterizes as a commentary on Premier Konoye’s recent statement
                                of policy.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese military command is quoted as being prepared “to receive
                                and shake hands with anyone whether or not affiliated with the
                                Kuomintang or its armies who is desirous of taking part in the huge
                                task of reconstructing a new China”. The statement also expresses
                                the gratification of the Japanese military authorities for the work
                                of the “Reformed Government” and asserts the Japanese forces are now
                                engaged in dealing a “finishing blow” to Chinese troop
                                reorganization. Of particular interest is that portion of the
                                statement which reads “the Government statement elucidating the
                                fundamental policies which will guide the readjustment of Japanese
                                relations with a new China is a most appropriate measure in view of
                                the current situation. This, however, cannot be regarded as
                                indicating any new developments occurring or any prospects of their
                                taking place within the occupied areas of Central China.”</p>
                            <p>These views if correctly quoted would appear to indicate that in so
                                far as the Japanese military command in Central China is concerned
                                no new development may be expected and that Japanese policy in the
                                Central China area actually will continue to move in the grooves
                                already established by the Japanese military authorities regardless
                                of policy pronouncements given out in Tokyo.</p>

                                uncomplimentary context and one which would suggest that Japan

                                maintained by such countries, and second, the suggestion that
                                Germany and Italy, “by recognizing the actual state of affairs in
                                East Asia” may expect to enjoy more fully than others the right of

                                    (2) Wu’s insistence upon terms to which the Japanese will not
                                    agree or, (3) both these conditions. Meanwhile a group of Wu’s
                                    adherents is preparing for Wu’s signature a manifesto appealing
                                    for peace, denouncing Chiang Kai Shek and possibly criticizing
                                    Wang Keh Min, head of the Peiping regime. It is too early to say
                                    whether Wu Pei Fu will actually issue such a manifesto.</item>

                            <p>0031. Mr. Wang Ching Wei, Chairman Central Political Council and
                                Deputy General Executive of Kuomintang, who has long favored early
                                termination of hostilities has, according to a report carried by
                                Domei, the official Japanese news agency, addressed a statement to
                                General Chiang Kai Shek and the supervising committees of the
                                Kuomintang Party urging immediate action to exchange views with the
                                Japanese Government for the restoration of peace. He suggests that
                                the Chinese Government accept latest Japanese proposals as a basis
                                for discussion and that China propose terms, including first a
                                responsible solution of the issue of the four northern provinces;
                                second, anti-Comintern collaboration; third, economic cooperation.
                                He states that China must insist that the Japanese Army withdraw
                                completely from China except that during the period of
                                anti-Comintern collaboration Japanese troops may be stationed in
                                Inner Mongolia. Japanese proposals have already been rejected,
                                according to statements of General Chiang and other Chinese
                                spokesman made public on 27 December, so it is probable that Mr.
                                Wang’s opinions are not shared by other important leaders. This is
                                substantiated by Mr. Wang’s sudden departure from Chungking.</p>

                            Juridicial Persons”, the Department instructed the American consular
                            officer at Mukden to register with the authorities at Hsinking emphatic
                            objection to any attempt by the “Manchukuo” régime to exercise
                            jurisdiction over American nationals and to point out that this

                        <p>Subsequently, the Department sent further instructions to American
                            consuls in Manchuria to the effect that while the American Government

                            <p>“2, February 5, 11 a.m. The Soviet Acting Consul General informed me
                                last night that the decision of his Government to restrict parcel
                                post service to and from Japan and Manchuria was an act of reprisal
                                for the detention of a Soviet mail plane which had inadvertently
                                landed near Mutanchi aerodrome on December 19, and that unless the
                                plane, its crew of two, and its cargo of 11,000 letters are released
                                within 2 weeks, stronger reprisals may be expected. He did not
                                specify their probable nature. He emphatically denied the Japanese
                                contention that the plane was armed.</p>
                            <p>He also said that on January 30 and 31 four clashes occurred near
                                Hunchun and Aigun when Russian troops were compelled to fire on,
                                drive back, Japanese soldiers trespassing on Russian territory, and
                                that although no casualties were reported, he filed a strong protest
                                with the Foreign Office delegate in Harbin.</p>
                            <p>Neither the incidents nor the protest in the circumstances reported
                                by the press.”</p>

                            little information was then available as to the reasons for them,

                            organizations. The press ban has been removed, and details have been
                            given to the public.</p>
                        <p>Before discussing the articles, it should first be stated that this
                            office is of the opinion that they are substantially true, despite the
                            notorious inaccuracy of the Harbin press and the ambiguity of official
                                <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0448"/>pronouncements in
                            “Manchukuo”. There has never been any doubt that the well-equipped
                            bandits received material assistance from Russia, and although the
                            present release may not contain the whole truth, its general accuracy
                            can hardly be questioned. Another point deemed worthy of note is that in
                            no place is there any indication that the various communist organs
                            discovered in Manchuria were in any way connected with Chinese
                            Communists now operating in northwest China; it is alleged throughout
                            that the communists of Manchuria received their orders directly from the
                            Comintern, and scrupulous care is taken to avoid mention of the Soviet
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>It is stated that 482 persons, mostly of the Chinese race, were arrested
                            in all; of these, 85 received death sentences, 64 were sentenced to hard
                            labor for various periods, 31 have not yet been sentenced, 26 will not
                            receive sentences, 135 are still under investigation, and the remainder
                            have been set free.</p>
                        <p>The release to the press states that communist activity in Manchuria was
                            started well before the Mukden Incident of September 18, 1931, with
                            headquarters in Mukden, and that after the occupation of that city by
                            the Japanese the agents were forced to transfer their main activities to
                            Harbin and North Manchuria. It is alleged that the bandit depredations
                            which were so serious in the years following 1932 were instigated by the
                            Comintern and carried out by such local organizations as the “Manchurian
                            Regional Committee of the Chinese Communist Party” and similar groups.
                            It would therefore appear that the “anti-bandit campaigns” which have
                            been reported by this office and by the Consulate General at Mukden for
                            the past four or five years were in reality campaigns against armed
                            communist groups which received substantial assistance from Russia.
                            These drives have to a great extent been successful, as depredations in
                            North Manchuria so far this winter have been much less than anticipated,
                            and Mukden reported last year that large-scale banditry was decidedly on
                            the wane in South Manchuria. This would appear to bear out the
                            contention of the authorities that they seized the principal communist
                            leaders.</p>
                        <p>It is not surprising that the articles fail to mention the mutinies in
                            the “Manchukuo” Army during July and August 1937, and their probable
                            instigation by agents of the Comintern.<note n="‡" xml:id="d425fn91"
                                >Despatch No. 359 of September 22, 1937; No. 554 to the Department.
                                [Footnote in the original; neither printed.]</note> According to
                            information believed to be reliable, the mutinies, in the Harbin area at
                            least, were only discovered through the arrest in the Chinese city of
                            communist agitators during the latter half of July 1937. These arrests
                            were undoubtedly connected with the anti-red activities now made
                            public.</p>
                        <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0449"/>
                        <p>Although the assertion is made that communist activity has been brought
                            to a standstill in Manchuria by the recently announced arrests, it
                            remains to be seen whether such is really the case. Russians in the
                            employ of the Japanese forces have said that large scale smuggling goes
                            on across the border, especially in the Pogranichnaya (Suifenho) region,
                            and it seems hardly likely that the Comintern will cease attempting to
                            harass Japan and “Manchukuo”. Although direct evidence is lacking, there
                            is reason to suppose that many of the incidents and armed clashes which
                            have taken place on the Russian border resulted from attempts of the
                            Japanese to put a stop to this activity.</p>

                            signature of the treaty relating to the termination of
                            extraterritoriality between Manchukuo and Japan as well as of the
                            interview which Mr. Chuichi Ohashi gave to the press on the subject of
                            the status of foreign nationals in Manchukuo.</p>
                        <p>The Belgian Government cannot admit that the treaty of November 5, 1937,
                            can have as a consequence the abolition in Manchukuo of the privileges
                            of extraterritoriality which Belgian nationals enjoy by virtue of the
                            treaties always in force.</p>

                                    West Coast Life Insurance Company.</p>
                                <p>The company’s agent reports that exchange restrictions are no
                                    problem at present; he felt able to remit all of his
                                    accumulation of premiums collected in local government currency,
                                    and now accepts only drafts in foreign currency presented by
                                    policy holders, who readily give [<hi rend="italic">get?</hi>]
                                    permits to pay premiums or loans. He expects this condition to
                                    continue.</p>
                                <p>He is not writing new policies, which must be in local currency
                                    unless special permission is granted. The company will not
                                    authorize policies in local currency, and so far has not given
                                    him the necessary authority to apply at Hsinking for permission
                                    to write policies in foreign currency and remit the premiums.
                                    Such permission would be valid only until June 1, when the new
                                    legislation comes into force, but he feels that it would be
                                    granted readily and would establish a precedent for similar
                                    permission following full compliance with the laws after the
                                    date mentioned.</p>
                                <p>On January 13, February 7 and 11 the Consulate General forwarded
                                    to the company’s Shanghai branch, at its request various
                                    translations of the pertinent law, the insurance business law,
                                    and a discussion of the situation. These, together with the
                                    agent’s recommendations and legal advice which it is understood
                                    have been forwarded, should be enough to enable the company to
                                    decide the question of compliance. No question of consular
                                    representations has arisen; the American Government has already
                                    protested the application of these laws to American nationals;
                                    and as other American firms are taking steps <pb n="450"

                                    stronger than it has been for over 2 years, with Japanese
                                    civilians admitting that if it comes it will be brought about by

                            under date June 25, 1937, addressed to you by Ambassador Johnson in
                            which it was suggested that you take up with the appropriate Japanese
                            authorities the question of the failure of the South Manchuria Railway
                            and its subsidiary organizations to discharge certain obligations to
                            American nationals and firms. As reported in Mukden’s despatch to the
                            Embassy at Peiping, No. 220 of March 23, 1938, (a copy of which was sent
                            to you)<note n="3" xml:id="d440fn3">Not printed.</note> the latest
                            representations in respect of one of these obligations, the payment of
                            certain Chinese Eastern Railway pensions, have been definitely rejected.
                            It will be noted that Vice Consul Davies,<note n="4" xml:id="d440fn4"
                                >Then at Mukden.</note> in accordance with the suggestion advanced
                            by Consul General Adams,<note n="5" xml:id="d440fn5">Then at
                                Harbin.</note> recommends that it be intimated to the appropriate
                            Japanese authorities that, in view of the failure of the State Railways
                            and the South Manchuria Railway to honor certain obligations, World
                            Trade Directory Beports on these concerns might necessarily be revised
                            to show a poorer credit rating.</p>
                        <p>Before giving consideration to this or any other specific suggestion for
                            action which might appropriately be taken by this Government as a
                            consequence of the failure of the South Manchuria Railway Company to
                            discharge what appear to be legitimate obligations to American firms and
                            individuals, the Department would welcome an expression of the Embassy’s
                            opinion in regard to the possibility that the officers of the company
                            might give further consideration to the claims in question if they were
                            made aware of the likelihood that their present attitude, in the event
                            that it became generally known in American financial circles, might
                            prejudice the business standing of the company in this country to an
                            extent out of proportion to the small sums involved in these claims. If,
                            in the Embassy’s opinion, a discreet intimation along these lines to the
                            appropriate Japanese authorities either by the Embassy, or by the Consul
                            at Dairen, or by both, would be likely to serve a useful purpose, you
                            are authorized in your discretion to make such an approach and to
                            instruct the Consul at Dairen <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0457"
                            />to make a similar approach to the head office of the South Manchuria

                        <p>These drafts were prepared by Japan–Manchuria and were presumably
                            presented to the Italian commercial mission as a basis for discussion.
                            We do not know what changes have been agreed upon. According to the most
                            recent press reports, the chairman of the mission returned to Hsinking
                            on June 21 to propose certain textual changes in the agreed upon drafts,
                            and he is to return to Tokyo for further discussions, after which the
                            agreements are to be signed.</p>

                            standard form for treaties of commerce and navigation. Among the points
                            which might be specially noted are: <list>

                        <p>3. Draft (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) provides that all commercial

                            regulated by the agreement, which is to run for a period of 1 year,
                            subject to extension for a further period of 1 year. The draft
                            contemplates a balancing of trade between Japan–Manchukuo and Italy, and
                            requires to that end <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0458"

                            statistical summary attached to draft (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                            indicates that Japan–Manchuria were prepared to accept Italian goods to
                            the total value of yen 34,000,000 including yen 19,000,000 for arms and
                            munitions and yen 3,000,000 for motor vehicles, and that Japan–Manchukuo
                            proposed exports to Italy, largely of primary and semimanufactured
                            commodities, to the value of lira 200,000,000, as against lira
                            150,000,000, acceptable to Italy.</p>
                        <p>4. The other two drafts are not of exceptional interest.</p>
                        <p>5. Our informant states that the discussions included the possible
                            purchase by Japan from Italy of airplanes to the value of 30,000,000
                            yen, but that this transaction has fallen through.</p>

                                <p>“25, July 19, 11 a.m. The Acting Soviet Consul General minimizes
                                    the importance of the recent incident on the eastern border, and
                                    asserts that it is ‘another Japanese bluff’. He said that he
                                    refused to accept the protest and demand for evacuation of
                                    Soviet troops lodged with him by the Harbin delegate of the
                                    Foreign Office because it was done by telephone at 10 p.m., July
                                    14, and because Russian troops had not crossed the border
                                    anyway. This probably explains why the Manchukuo government has
                                    received no reply to the protest, as stated in the press. He
                                    departed today on home leave as scheduled.</p>
                                <p>The hill, said to have been occupied by Russian soldiers, has not
                                    been occupied before, according to a report to Soviet and to
                                    Manchukuo officials, and hence probably is not as important
                                    strategically as reported in the Japanese press. This office
                                    feels that perhaps the incident is being played up by the
                                    Japanese because no satisfactory news is coming out of
                                    China.</p>

                                        considerable thought to the question of whether military
                                        operations subsequent to the fall of Hankow should be pushed
                                        to the extent of attempting the actual physical destruction
                                        of the Chiang Kai Shek regime, or whether the situation
                                        could be better handled by a relative suspension of
                                        offensive operations after the fall of Hankow and a
                                        resumption of political activity directed toward a
                                        reorganization of Central China along political lines on the
                                        assumption that, with the fall of Hankow, the Chiang
                                        government will in this event have been crushed.</item>
                                    <item>2. It has also been reported that there is a relation
                                        between the above question and the recent border incidents,
                                        the most important of which is the occupation of the hill at
                                        Changkufeng by Russian troops. In regard to this incident,
                                        it is reported that there are two factions in the
                                        Government, one advocating positive action with a view to
                                        actually forcing the Russian troops out of the occupied
                                        position, and the other advocating caution and the adoption
                                        of a watchful policy to be accompanied however by certain
                                        precautionary moves on the part of Japanese troops in the
                                        vicinity.</item>
                                    <item>3. In other words, viewing the two questions as related,
                                        one school of thought advocates the suspension of military
                                        operations beyond Hankow and a strong handling of the border
                                        situation while attempting the political downfall of Chiang
                                        Kai Shek, while the other leans toward avoiding border
                                        operations in order to operate more vigorously toward a
                                        complete destruction of the Chiang government, and with it
                                        the likelihood of future Russian operations in support of
                                        that government.</item>
                                    <item>4. While it is difficult to determine what may be the
                                        Japanese course of action in the present situation, as that
                                        course will obviously be determined by Japanese estimates as
                                        to Russian motives in the present border activities, it is
                                        none the less apparent that these activities have
                                        constituted a sort of diversion which demands careful
                                        consideration in its relation to operations in
                                        China”.</item>

                            done nothing further than to pursue a policy of what our informant
                            termed “watchful waiting”. According to our informant, a popular version
                            of the affair is that the Russians <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458"
                                facs="0462"/>in occupying the position at Changkufeng were sounding
                            out the Japanese with a view to ascertaining whether they were prepared
                            for hostilities on a grand scale, which he added was similar to the
                            assertion made at the time last year when the Japanese occupied the
                            islands in the Amur River that Japan was sounding out Russia with a view
                            to ascertaining whether it was prepared for hostilities on a grand
                            scale.</p>

                        <p>202. My telegram No. 199, July 24, 4 p.m.,<note n="15" xml:id="d449fn15"
                                >Not printed.</note> and previous. In the course of a conversation
                            last night Litvinov discussed briefly the present Soviet-Japanese
                            controversy. He said that the Soviet soldiers had every right to occupy
                            the position to the west of Lake Khasan, that maps of long standing in
                            the possession of Soviet Government proved definitely the Soviet
                            contention and that, therefore, there was no reason why the soldiers
                            should be withdrawn as the Japanese had requested. However, he said that
                            he did not believe that this incident would result in hostilities, that
                            the Soviet Union had no intention of “attacking” the Japanese and that
                            he was informed that the Japanese military authorities were opposed to
                            precipitating a conflict with the Soviets. Litvinov added that he had
                            told the Japanese Ambassador that he would examine any proofs of the
                            Japanese contention that the Ambassador might care to submit (see my
                            195, July 22, noon”) and that he supposed that the Japanese Government
                            was now working on further representations to the Soviet Government
                            which would encourage some adjustment of the controversy.</p>

                            yesterday afternoon at 4:30, lasting until 5 this morning, between the
                            Soviet troops and Japanese-Manchukuo troops at Changkufeng. The

                            positions on the hill at Changkufeng and driven off the Soviet troops to
                            the eastward. The communiqué reports approximately 200 Russian
                            casualties, 30 having been found dead on the field, as well as a number

                        <p>212. My 210, July 30, 1 p.m. Tass reports in today’s Soviet press that on
                            July 31 Japanese military forces violated the Soviet border on the
                            heights west of Lake Khasan and that Japanese troops opening unexpected
                            artillery fire during the night suddenly attacked troops of the border
                            guard of the Soviet Union stationed on the frontier. The Japanese
                            occupied Soviet territory to a depth of 4 kilometres. On the heights
                            west of Lake Khasan a clash took place which lasted for several hours.
                            The report adds that the Japanese military forces received a severe
                            repulse and the Japanese troops suffered heavy losses in men and
                            materials. The losses of the Soviet troops are being investigated.</p>

                        <p>215. Referring to my 210, July 30, 1 p.m.; and 212, August 1, 10 a.m., an
                            official of the Japanese Embassy today stated that the following
                            information has been received from Tokyo in regard to the <pb n="461"
                                xml:id="pg_461" facs="0465"/>incidents reported in the Soviet press
                            and referred to in my telegrams under reference. According to this
                            information, 10 Soviet soldiers on July 29 at 9:30 a.m. crossed the
                            Manchurian frontier about 2 miles north of Lake Khazan and were repulsed
                            by Japanese troops. The Japanese troops then withdrew behind the
                            frontier but at 4 p.m., the Soviet forces again attacked with tanks and
                            artillery and were again repulsed by the Japanese forces, who this time
                            remained in the disputed area. On July 31st, the Soviet troops in the
                            same area returned to the attack, supported by artillery fire and tanks,
                            and, after a skirmish which lasted several hours, were thrown back by
                            the Japanese troops. The Soviet losses were 60 killed and the Japanese
                            30 killed, and the Japanese captured 10 or 11 Soviet tanks. In
                            connection with this engagement the Japanese forces on the same day
                            occupied the town of Changkufeng, the original center of
                            disturbances.</p>
                        <p>The official of the Japanese Embassy added that messages from Tokyo which
                            he assumed were in relation to the foregoing developments had just
                            reached the Embassy.</p>

                        <p>217. Referring to my telegram No. 216, August 1, 8 p.m.,<note n="18"
                                xml:id="d456fn18">Not printed.</note> following statement issued
                            during the night. According to information received by Tass from
                            authoritative sources, the account of the clash between the Soviet and
                            Japanese detachments in the region of Lake Khasan has been as follows:
                            on July 29 after the Japanese detachment was ejected on the hill
                            Bezimiannya occupied by them the Japanese concentrated their troops
                            consisting of one division against Zaozernoi (Changkufeng) hill which is
                            situated in Soviet territory.</p>
                        <p>On July 31 at 3 a.m., Japanese troops under cover of artillery fire
                            suddenly attacked Soviet frontier posts and compelled them to retreat
                            from Zaozernoi hill. Simultaneously the Japanese artillery began to
                            bombard the adjacent heights and the road behind them in order to
                            prevent Soviet reinforcements from approaching. Aided by artillery
                            Japanese infantry succeeded in penetrating 4 kilometres into Soviet
                            territory. In a few hours Soviet regular troops which had come up
                            ejected the Japanese from Soviet territory. On both sides there are
                            wounded and killed. Japanese lost 400 killed and wounded. The Japanese
                            abandoned on Soviet territory 5 cannon, 14 machine gun, 157 rifles with
                            ammunition. On the Soviet side there <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462"
                                facs="0466"/>were 55 wounded, 13 killed. In addition one Soviet tank
                            and cannon also were disabled. It is assumed that a Soviet pilot who
                            parachuted from a scouting plane fell into the hands of the Japanese.
                            Both before the Japanese invasion and during the battle, Soviet troops
                            never violated the Manchurian border which deprived them of the chance
                            of encircling the invaders or taking them on the flank.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Chargé d’Affaires in Tokyo was instructed to present an
                            energetic protest to the Japanese Government and to call its attention
                            to the possible threatening consequence of the actions of the Japanese
                            militarists unwilling to respect the inviolability of Soviet territory
                            the boundaries of which have been established by Russo-Chinese
                            agreements and clearly delineated in the maps bearing the signatures of
                            representatives of China annexed thereto.</p>

                        <p>31. The Kwantung Army officially released at 2:30 last night a statement
                            to the effect that during the afternoon Soviet planes bombed the railway
                            and bridges along the Tumen River both in Manchuria and Korea and that
                            five of them were shot down.</p>
                        <p>An American visitor in Hsinking last week declared the officials there
                            were relieved when the tension appeared to be relaxing. He was certain
                            that the Russians were the aggressors. It therefore follows that the
                            present incident, if reported correctly by the Kwantung Army, is
                            undoubtedly causing great concern in Hsinking and Tokyo, as all evidence
                            indicates that the Japanese do not desire a Soviet war at the present
                            time.</p>
                        <p>It has been reliably learned that civilian movements in the affected
                            districts in Manchuria and Korea have been strictly controlled for the
                            past 10 days.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Suma called at his own request to acquaint me confidentially with
                            information he had received from his Government in regard to the
                            situation on the Siberian-Manchurian border. Most of the information was
                            a repetition of Japanese official communiqués which have already been
                            reported in the press and by our Embassy at Tokyo. Mr. Suma showed me a
                            map of the border region where the recent incidents have occurred and
                            said that when the Japanese Ambassador at Moscow protested against the
                            Russian occupation of Changkufeng the Russians produced a copy of a map
                            which they said accompanied the Hunchun Treaty of 1868<note n="19"

                            had been furnished by the Russian Government with copies of maps
                            defining the borders and that according to these maps the disputed place
                            was in Manchuria. The map which Litvinoff showed to Ambassador
                            Shigemitsu was not among the maps which had been furnished the Japanese
                            Government in 1906.</p>
                        <p>I said that our information in regard to this situation was derived from
                            official communiqués of the two sides issued in the press and that I had
                            understood from these communiqués that the Japanese did not intend to
                            take military measures to recover the disputed territory. Mr. Suma said
                            that that was the case up to the time that certain Manchurian gendarmes
                            were arrested by the Soviet authorities on the 30th which was the direct
                            cause of the subsequent fighting. Mr. Suma said <pb n="464"
                                xml:id="pg_464" facs="0468"/>that according to latest reports Soviet
                            airplanes had made incursions into Korean territory. They had gone as
                            far as Rashin and had dropped bombs at the port of Yuki. Mr. Suma said
                            that the Japanese Government was making every effort to reach a peaceful
                            settlement and had reasonable hopes that such a settlement would be
                            reached. He said that of course it was impossible to make any
                            predictions but he was hopeful of a satisfactory outcome.</p>

                        <p>I understand that the messages received by the Japanese Ambassador
                            yesterday (see my 215, August 1, 2 p.m.) instructed him to protest in
                            person to Litvinov against the violation of Manchurian territory by
                            Soviet troops and to resume discussion on the general controversy; that
                            the Japanese Ambassador considered it inadvisable for him to approach
                            Litvinov personally at the present time and sent instead a secretary of
                            the Embassy to deliver the protest to an official of the Foreign Office.
                            The Soviet official, however, is said to have declined to discuss the
                            matter with the Japanese representative stating that the matter was too
                            serious to be discussed between subordinates.</p>

                        <p>220. My 217, August 2, 8 a.m. Following Tass communiqué published in
                            Soviet press this morning: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“At dawn on August 2 the Japanese Army again launched an attack
                                    on the height of Zaozernaya [Changkufeng] situated on Soviet
                                    territory and the struggle for the possession lasted throughout
                                    the entire day. Whenever the Japanese forces penetrated into
                                    Soviet territory they were subjected to artillery fire and
                                    aerial bombardment from the Soviet side which caused them
                                    enormous losses.</p>

                                    are strongly denied by the competent Soviet circles. They point
                                    out that from the very beginning of the conflict the Soviet
                                    Government has declared that it intends to defend only territory
                                    belonging unquestionably to the Soviet Union and that the air
                                    forces as well as the infantry in strict observance of this
                                    directive have held themselves the entire time exclusively
                                    within the borders of the Soviet Union. They suggest that the
                                    above mentioned accounts have been purposely spread by the
                                    Japanese militarists in order to justify their repeated attacks
                                    on Soviet territory and the enormous losses which they are
                                    suffering. The opinion is also advanced that the Japanese
                                    authorities in their provocative actions are being encouraged by
                                    certain Japanese diplomats. In these circumstances it is
                                    considered inevitable that the further continuation of military
                                    actions is fraught with the most serious consequences.”<note

                            position referred to in my 219, August 2, 10 p.m., and has not sought an

                            in dispute is stating here that the Japanese Government has no desire to
                            acquire further territory in the region nor to bring about an
                            enlargement of the conflict. In would appear from the foregoing that in
                            so far as diplomatic negotiations in Moscow are concerned both the
                            Soviet and Japanese Governments have not advanced beyond the positions
                            assumed at the beginning of the controversy.</p>

                        <p>516. Embassy’s 508, August 2, 6 p.m., Soviet border clash.</p>
                        <p>1. The featuring by the press of reports on the Soviet border incident is
                            running a poor second to reports on the advance towards Hankow.
                            Systematic and effective use is being made of Domei reports <pb n="466"
                                xml:id="pg_466" facs="0470"/>from each important capital to the
                            effect that dominant opinion at such capital does not expect the
                            incident to develop into war. Particular interest attaches to reports
                            that Moscow is not excited and that the Soviet press appears to be
                            belittling the incident. At the same time Japanese Army releases
                            purporting to be simply factual accounts are currently published and
                            they make it clear that the scale of fighting has been dangerously
                            extensive. One release published today states that the Soviet forces in
                            the vicinity of Changkufeng include 3 battalions of infantry and 1
                            mechanized brigade with more than 200 tanks. Soviet air raids involving
                            large numbers of planes, over points in Manchuria and Korea, continue to
                            be affirmed.</p>
                        <p>2. The populace shows no desire for war against the Soviet Union and
                            appears to be calm. However, apprehension is evidenced among officials
                            and other informed Japanese, who feel that, as it is now the Soviet’s
                            turn to move, the decision for war or peace rests with Moscow.</p>
                        <p>We learn from the Foreign Office that Litvinov is evading the Japanese
                            Ambassador, which would seem to support press despatches from European
                            capitals that the Soviet Government has not as yet made its decision. It
                            was also stated at the Foreign Office that Japan will, whatever the
                            consequences, tolerate no violation of the frontier. Nevertheless, there
                            appears to be moderate optimism that war will not eventuate.</p>
                        <p>3. As there is available in Tokyo no information from sources other than
                            Japanese, we are in no position to decide whether we wish to modify our
                            views on Soviet-Japanese relations expressed in our despatch 2822 of
                            March 18<note n="22" xml:id="d463fn22">Not printed.</note> and in other
                            reports. It would appear, however, that the Soviet forces have, by
                            moving into an area the ownership of which has been for some time in
                            controversy, initiated this dangerous situation. Whether the motive was
                            to divert Japanese forces from operations against China, as has been
                            suggested, or some other, the Soviets have apparently precipitated a
                            situation which may become impossible either for the Soviet Union or
                            Japan to control.</p>

                        <p>228. Reference my telegram 223, August 3, midnight. A member of the
                            Japanese Embassy informed me today that the Japanese Ambassador acting
                            under instructions from his Government called on <pb n="467"
                                xml:id="pg_467" facs="0471"/>Litvinov this afternoon and made the
                            following proposals in the name of the Japanese Government which were
                            also presented to the Soviet Chargé d’Affaires in Tokyo.</p>

                            <item>The immediate cessation of hostilities in the area to be followed
                                by discussions through diplomatic channels in regard to the means of
                                establishing a truce.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Following the cessation of hostilities and the establishment of a
                                truce, the Japanese Government was prepared to discuss the question
                                of the frontier in that region on the basis of the merits of the
                                case, and each side would then present documentary and other
                                evidence to substantiate its claim to the region in dispute.
                                Litvinov, according to the official of the Japanese Embassy, without
                                definitely rejecting the entire Japanese proposal, stated that the
                                Soviet Government could agree to no cessation of hostilities until
                                the Japanese troops had withdrawn behind the frontier line shown on
                                the map annexed to the Hunchun Treaty, which had been published
                                yesterday in the Soviet press, but that following withdrawal behind
                                what the Soviet Government had maintained and continued to maintain
                                was the correct frontier line, the Soviet Government would then be
                                glad to bring about the immediate cessation of hostilities and
                                discuss with the Japanese Government the exact demarcation of the
                                frontier.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>My informant added that the discussion lasted over 2½ hours and consisted
                            largely of reiterations of the respective positions indicated above
                            without making any progress towards their reconciliation. He believed,
                            however, that while no progress had been made in today’s conversation it
                            did not mean that the door was shut for future conversations between the
                            two Governments. The Japanese Ambassador, I understand, is reporting to
                            his Government and does not intend to seek a further interview with
                            Litvinov pending the receipt of further instructions from Tokyo.</p>

                        <p>229. My 288, August 4, 10 p.m. Following is translation of Tass report
                            published in today’s press: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Yesterday, August 4, the Japanese Ambassador in Moscow, Mr.
                                    Shigemitsu, called on the People’s Commissar for Foreign
                                    Affairs, Comrade Litvinov, and with reference to the clash in
                                    the region of Lake Khasan, declared that the Japanese Government
                                    had the intention of resolving the ‘Incident’ by peaceful means
                                    as a local incident. Under instructions from his Government, the
                                    Ambassador therefore <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0472"/>is
                                    proposing to terminate military actions by both sides and to
                                    transfer the question to negotiations through diplomatic
                                    channels.</p>
                                <p>Comrade Litvinov replied that if in reality the Japanese
                                    Government had peaceful intentions then the activities of the
                                    Japanese military authorities are not at all in conformity
                                    thereto. The armed incursion into Soviet territory and the night
                                    attack on the Soviet frontier post accompanied by the use of
                                    artillery could only ironically be called peaceful actions. The
                                    incident had arisen only as a result of these activities and had
                                    they not occurred there would have been no incident. If the
                                    Japanese will terminate the attacks on Soviet territory and the
                                    bombardment thereof and will recall those remnants of its armed
                                    forces which may still be on Soviet territory, there would then
                                    be no reason for the Soviet forces to continue its counter
                                    military activities and then the Soviet Government will be
                                    prepared to proceed to the diplomatic consideration of those
                                    proposals which the Japanese Government may wish to make to it.
                                    However, the inviolability of the Soviet frontier established by
                                    the Hunchun Agreement and the map annexed thereto must be
                                    preliminarily guaranteed.</p>
                                <p>The Ambassador said that he had intention to renounce the dispute
                                    concerning the frontier and concerning the responsibility of one
                                    side or the other, because of the [apparent omission] there was
                                    no common views on both sides on that score. He recognizes the
                                    validity of international treaties but Manchukuo, after its
                                    separation from China, has its own data. Japan has now seen for
                                    the first time the map annexed to the Hunchun Agreement. It
                                    would be unreasonable, therefore, to decide the incident on the
                                    basis of such a map. However, the Japanese Government is
                                    prepared to proceed to concrete negotiations on the spot
                                    concerning the treaty and the map. Negotiations had already
                                    taken place previously concerning the abstract delineation of
                                    the frontier between Japan and the Soviet Union and an agreement
                                    had been reached concerning the composition of mixed
                                    commissions. If the question is based only on maps, then there
                                    would have been no reason to speak of mixed commissions. In the
                                    meantime, it is necessary to speak in a practical sense
                                    concerning the termination of military activities and of the
                                    reestablishment of the situation existing prior to July 11.</p>
                                <p>To this, the People’s Commissar declared as follows: <quote

                                        <p>‘Frontiers between states are defined exclusively by
                                            international agreements and maps and not by the
                                            subjective opinions or wishes of governments and
                                            military circles or by unofficial data. The official
                                            documents produced by the Soviet side have been
                                            countered on the Japanese side by nothing more than a
                                            declaration concerning its desire for a different
                                            frontier. The frontier between the Soviet Union,
                                            Manchuria and Korea can only be that which has been
                                            established by agreements and treaties concluded with
                                            the Chinese Government and by maps annexed thereto. The
                                            occupation of Manchuria by Japan does not give the
                                            latter the right to demand an alteration of the
                                            frontier. In any event, the Soviet Government has not
                                            agreed and will not agree to a reexamination of the
                                            frontier. It is not our fault if Tokyo has not in its
                                            possession the treaties and maps which were in the
                                            possession of the Commission and should be in that of
                                            Manchuria. But if, in fact, they are not available, then
                                            the Ambassador could, of course, have asked us to give
                                            him copies of these treaties and maps for examination.
                                            But the Japanese Armed Forces had preferred instead the
                                            path of direct action and had penetrated beyond the line
                                            indicated on the map. The Soviet Government does not
                                            withhold its consent to the creation of mixed
                                            commissions under the definite conditions stated by it.
                                            The question then did not <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469"

                                            frontier but to the demarcation (the establishment of
                                            frontier signs) or the redemarcation of the grades on

                                            Agreement, then we will be prepared to include in the
                                            work of the Mixed Commission the grades indicated
                                            therein but only for redemarcation. There can be no
                                            question of the substitution of the Hunchun Agreement by
                                            another. In regard to the termination of military
                                            activities, if there will be reestablished the situation
                                            existing prior approximately to the 29 of July, that is
                                            prior to the attempts by Japanese to force the heights
                                            of Bezymyannaya and subsequently Zaozernaya, and if the
                                            Manchurian side will cease attacks on Soviet territory
                                            lying behind the line indicated in the Hunchun Treaty
                                            and the bombardment of that territory and the remnants
                                            of the Japanese forces which may still remain on that
                                            territory will be withdrawn, then the military
                                            activities on the Soviet side will also cease for they
                                            would become without object since we need no Manchurian
                                            territory. The Japanese could have convinced themselves
                                            after the night seizure of the height of Zaozernaya that
                                            no preparations of any kind for offensive actions had
                                            been made there and that even no fortifications of any
                                            kind had been constructed. This, best of all, bears
                                            witness to the peaceful intentions of the Soviet side.
                                            The Soviet peoples, however, will not be reconciled to
                                            the presence of foreign troops on even a small piece of
                                            territory which they consider indisputably theirs, and
                                            will not hesitate before any sacrifices in order to free
                                            it from them. Therefore, as long as the attacks on
                                            Soviet territory and the bombardment thereof continue or
                                            as long as there is to be found even one Japanese
                                            soldier thereon, the Soviet Government must reserve to
                                            itself liberty of action. The Ambassador surely has
                                            understood and will accurately convey to his Government
                                            what is required in order to terminate the military
                                            activities. Later on, the Japanese Government may
                                            receive a copy or photostatic copy of the Hunchun
                                            Agreement and map and [<hi rend="italic">in order?</hi>]

                        <p>Certain foreign circles in Moscow profess to see in the above
                            conversation between Litvinov and the Japanese Ambassador evidence of
                            the possibility of some slight lessening, for the moment, of the tension
                            between the two countries. The sole basis for this belief would appear
                            to be the mere fact that after many days of an apparent interruption of
                            diplomatic contact between the Soviet and Japanese Governments, while
                            military operations continued, conversations were held yesterday both in
                            Moscow and Tokyo. While it is recognized that these conversations do not
                            appear to have marked any advance toward a solution and that both sides
                            are maintaining their original stands, there is some inclination here,
                            however, to see evidence of a weakening in the Japanese position in that
                            that Government made the initial move in yesterday’s conversations and
                            apparently refrained on that occasion from further specific protests
                            against alleged Soviet violations of Manchurian territory or from any
                            categorical claim that the territory in dispute was without question
                            Manchurian. In so far as the Embassy is aware there would appear to be
                            no evidence of any modification of the Soviet position that the portion
                            of territory in dispute is incontestably Soviet and therefore its
                            possession is not a subject for negotiation or possible compromise.</p>

                        <p>231. Referring to my telegram No. 228, August 5 [<hi rend="italic"
                            >4</hi>], 10 a.m. [<hi rend="italic">p.m.</hi>], during my interview
                            with Litvinov today he informed me that the Soviet Government “knew”
                            that Japan did not desire a war with the Soviet Union and that the
                            Soviet Government had no intention of receding from its position which
                            it felt was right. He added that such controversies would continue as
                            long as the Fascist nations existed unless combined action could be
                            taken against them and that the only manner of dealing with those
                            nations was to meet force or threat of force with the same weapons.</p>
                        <p>Soviet military circles confirm the above opinion that the Japanese will
                            not go to war over this incident and reiterate the determination of the
                            Soviet Government to take all necessary measures to force the withdrawal
                            of the Japanese troops from Soviet territory. The same circles stated
                            this morning that the struggle was still going on; that it was believed
                            that on the Japanese side one Japanese division was involved and
                            intimated that the Soviet forces consisted of border troops together
                            with some detachments of one Bed Army division hut that the total number
                            did not equal one whole division.</p>

                        <p>730. In the course of a conversation at the Foreign Office today the
                            Embassy was informed that they had no reliable information regarding the
                            Russo-Japanese hostilities on the Manchukuo border. Both parties to the
                            dispute were “such accomplished liars” and there was no satisfactory way
                            to judge the relative merits of their stories. The Foreign Office felt
                            that neither of the two Governments as distinct from their respective
                            commanders in the area under dispute desired war and the British
                            Government hoped and was inclined to believe that this dispute would be
                            settled in one way or another like the previous border disturbances.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand the Chinese were not unnaturally equally anxious that
                            the disturbances would lead to a further war and were doing whatever
                            they could toward that end by spreading alarming reports and otherwise
                            aggravating the situation.</p>

                                970.</note> the Russians contended that in the treaty of 1886
                            reaffirming the earlier one the maps attached showed Changkufeng in
                            Russian territory. The Japanese, however, state that in 1908 Russia
                            handed them copies of these maps which did not show the disputed hill in
                            Russian territory. The Japanese ask therefore why in 1938 Russia should
                            submit maps purporting to be those of the 1886 treaty which do not
                            conform to the maps given to the Japanese 30 years ago.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office said that they did not know to whom to attribute this
                            clash. One could accept any one of a number of interpretations but there
                            were too many unknown factors to weigh the interpretations with any
                            accuracy. Possibly Russia was gambling that Japan would not dare risk a
                            real fight and this disturbance would prevent Japan from sending troops
                            from Manchuria to the Chinese battle areas. By the same token the
                            Foreign Office said that Japan might be gambling that Russia would not
                            risk a real war.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> in a leading editorial on the subject
                            says: “All previous similar clashes have petered out in a drizzle of
                            diplomatic protests, rumors of troop movements and half-hearted
                            proposals for a boundary commission”, and that the odds are against the
                            Changkufeng affair departing very far from this precedent. It thinks it
                            is understandable that the desire for a settlement should be more
                            apparent in Japan than in Russia. Other puzzling features of the affair
                            are that considering the strategic importance of the hill it escaped
                            having its ownership established long ago. The <hi rend="italic"
                                >Times</hi> says Russia may have wished to make a diversion in the
                            north to relieve the pressure on the Chinese but this explanation is
                            weakened by two considerations: (1) The Japanese have for some weeks
                            past been reinforcing on the frontier, and (2) that the self-contained
                            expedition now advancing on Hankow would hardly be much affected by a
                            flurry in the north. A likely culprit or hero is a military commander on
                            the spot who took the initiative in search of glory. Two years ago it
                            would have been safe to assume that he was a Japanese but today it was
                            an even chance. But the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> believes a study of
                            the events leading to the clash suggests that the Japanese took the
                            initiative and that the ardor of the Russians in taking up the challenge
                            may well have been enhanced by the conviction that to die in battle is
                            better than to be shot against a wall. The article concludes that
                            everything considered the Japanese militarists may emerge from this
                            scrape in a slightly chastened frame of mind.</p>

                                >Not printed.</note> A member of the Japanese Embassy confirms the
                            report that the Japanese Ambassador has been instructed by his
                            Government to seek an interview with Litvinov and that the meeting would
                            probably take place today. He was unable to divulge the purport of the
                            instructions or state whether they related to a protest on the part of
                            the Japanese in regard to the bombardment of Korean villages or to the
                            general subject of the conflict.</p>
                        <p>The same official said that a few days ago the local Soviet authorities
                            in Khabarovsk had demanded the closing of the Japanese Consulate General
                            in that city and had requested the Consul General to leave immediately
                            and that the Consul General had left under protest on August 6 for
                            Vladivostok. He added that the closing of the Khabarovsk Consulate had
                            been under consideration in connection with the request of the Soviet
                            Government for the closing of several Japanese Consulates in the Far
                            East, as has been previously reported, but that the present action of
                            the local authorities had been taken without previous warning and in
                            entirely arbitrary fashion.</p>

                        <p>237. My 236, August 7, 5 p.m. In a communiqué issued tonight entitled
                            “Staff Report of the First (Primoria) Army” it is stated that 1 day
                            following the so-called peaceful offer of the Japanese Ambassador on
                            August 4th the Japanese troops opened an intensive fire on Soviet
                            territory from the heights behind Lake Khasan. Artillery fire from
                            Manchurian territory covered the offensive operations of the Japanese
                            infantry against the Soviet troops who responded with artillery fire.
                            The communiqué continues that after 3 or 4 hours the Japanese artillery
                            was silenced and the Soviet detachment aided by aviation cleared the
                            remaining Japanese troops from Soviet territory and Soviet troops
                            occupied frontier points.</p>

                            conference this evening lasting for more than 3 hours. According to a

                            to a foreign press correspondent which is the only account of the

                            Governments and the basis on which each maintained some solution might

                        <p>[Here follows a lengthy report of conversation between the Japanese
                            Ambassador and the Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs on August 7, in
                            which the positions stated by each were substantially a reiteration of
                            those reported in previous telegrams.]</p>
                        <p>The [Japanese] Ambassador promised to consider the contents of the
                            conversation which had taken place and to revert thereto. Thereupon
                            Comrade Litvinov made the following declaration to the Ambassador:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    regions of Grodekovo a Japanese company with three machine guns
                                    suddenly attacked the Soviet border detachment guarding height
                                    588.3 situated on Soviet territory and occupied it. The Soviet
                                    reinforcements which came up were fired upon by machine guns on
                                    the part of the Japanese company, which having fled to Manchuria
                                    territory left on the height 10 Japanese grenades and 50 used
                                    grenade cases. During the fight several Red Army men were killed
                                    and wounded. There were obviously killed and wounded also on the

                                    artillery and aviation. Let the Japanese Government oblige the
                                    Kwantung and Korean Armies to respect the existing frontier. It
                                    is time to put an end to the endless “incidents” and dashes on
                                    the frontier.</p>

                            account of the incident in the vicinity of Grodekovo referred to by
                            Litvinov in the above communiqué.</p>
                        <p>Today’s <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> prints under the title “Japan’s
                            Militarism is Drawing Japan into a War with the Soviet Union” the first
                            important editorial which has appeared in the Soviet press devoted
                            exclusively to actual conflict in the Far East. This editorial after
                            reviewing the course of events since the 29th or improving the Soviet
                            version thereof and the diplomatic conversations which have taken place
                            between Shigemitsu and Litvinov since that date reiterates the Soviet
                            position as outlined in the above communiqué. After announcing that
                            Soviet territory has been cleared of the remnants of the Japanese
                            forces, the editorial inquires rhetorically what guarantees there are
                            that the Japanese militarism will not renew its attack and states
                            “therefore if the Japanese Government is in fact animated, as the
                            Japanese Ambassador declared on August 4th, by peaceful intentions, then
                            it must give clear and precise guarantees that the attacks on Soviet
                            territory will not be repeated.” After repeating the Soviet conditions
                            for a solution of this conflict the editorial emphasizes that the Soviet
                            Government however has not consented and will not consent to a
                            reexamination of the frontier. In conclusion the editorial states <hi
                                rend="italic">inter alia</hi> that “there can be no doubt but that
                            the popular masses of Japan and also those elements of the ruling camp
                            who soberly evaluate the international and internal situation of their
                            country are not interested in war with the Soviet Union. One must
                            believe that the Japanese militarists know this well. But evidently
                            precisely for that reason the adversaries who are striving at all costs
                            to involve Japan in a war with the Soviet Union are proceeding further
                            and further in provocative activities.”</p>

                        <p>243. My telegram No. 239, August 8, 11 a.m. I understand that the
                            Japanese Ambassador is manifesting greater pessimism following <pb
                                n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0479"/>his last conversation with
                            Litvinov and professes to be unable to understand Litvinov’s attitude
                            toward the Japanese proposal for cessation of hostilities in view of the
                            fact that Litvinov stated that there were no Japanese troops at that
                            time on Soviet territory and consequently the Soviet insistence on the
                            removal of Japanese troops from territory claimed as Soviet as a
                            condition precedent to any agreement had, on the basis of this
                            admission, been met. I understand further that the Ambassador states
                            that the communiqué of the interview while substantially correct failed
                            to mention that the Japanese Ambassador had refused to accept Litvinov’s
                            version that Japanese troops had attacked on August 5 and that Japanese
                            forces had provoked the incident at Grodekovo and had said that in both
                            instances Soviet troops had taken the initiative. It is furthermore
                            reported that the Japanese Ambassador admitted yesterday that the
                            Russian troops were believed to be in occupancy of some part but not all
                            of the Height Changkuf eng.</p>
                        <p>The declaration, as published in the communiqué of August 8 to the effect
                            that Litvinov after stating that no Japanese troops were on Soviet
                            territory did not meet the Japanese proposal for an immediate cessation
                            of hostilities, has given rise to speculation in foreign circles as to
                            the possible motives actuating this stand. The following opinions have
                            been suggested possible explanation: (1) That Litvinov’s statement and
                            the military communiqué were not in accordance with the facts and that
                            Japanese troops were still in occupancy of what the Soviet Government
                            considers to be Soviet territory; (2) that as fighting was presumably
                            still continuing Litvinov envisaged the possibility that before the
                            cessation of hostilities could be actually effected the military
                            situation might alter in favor of the Japanese and that contrary to his
                            previous stand he would then be in the position of having agreed to a
                            cessation of hostilities while Japanese troops were actually in
                            occupation of Soviet territory, or (8) that the Soviet Government or
                            Litvinov in the hope of exacting further concessions from the Japanese
                            in regard to the general question of border incidents along the entire
                            frontier is not desirous at the present time of terminating the
                            incident. In support of the last explanation, it may be pointed out that
                            the last paragraph of the Soviet communiqué on the conversation
                            introduced an element heretofore not present in the Soviet demands,
                            namely, that some general assurance will be sought from the Japanese
                            against the recurrence of similar frontier incidents in the future.</p>
                        <p>Up to the present, at least from the published communiqués of the Soviet
                            Government and from other information available to the Embassy, there
                            appears to be no evidence that the Soviet Government intends to recede
                            from the position which it has maintained since the beginning of the
                            controversy and there is an intimation in <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476"
                                facs="0480"/>the request for a general assurance as indicated above
                            that the Soviet Government may even be broadening its original position.
                            In this way the Soviet Government, on the supposition that the Japanese
                            do not intend to engage in a general war with the Soviet Union at the
                            present time, may be endeavoring to secure as complete a diplomatic
                            victory as possible in the present instance and may be manifesting an
                            uncompromising attitude in this controversy with a view to enhancing
                            Soviet prestige in general throughout the world at this particular
                            moment. As regards Litvinov’s personal role in the present controversy,
                            the consideration should not be excluded that the firm attitude which he
                            has displayed may be motivated by a desire for the maximum of success
                            with a view to enhancing his own standing with the Kremlin and his
                            personal reputation abroad.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador<note n="26" xml:id="d473fn26">Hirosi
                                Saito.</note> called on his own request. He said he and his wife
                            were down from Hot Springs, Virginia, for a few days and that while here
                            he desired to call, both to pay his respects and to point out the
                            Japanese position with respect to the controversy between Japan and
                            Soviet Russia over the frontier near the Tumen River. The Ambassador
                            said that there had been a Treaty of 1860 and later a Treaty of 1886,
                            that the Treaty of 1886 left the Changkufeng mountain or hill on the
                            Japanese side; that the Soviets claim it to be on their side of the
                            line; and that the Soviet claim is based on a change in the bed of the
                            river. He said that early in July the Soviets moved some troops to
                            Changkufeng hill and occupied it; that there has been desultory fighting
                            since that time; that on yesterday the press reported the Soviets in
                            possession of this hill, while today the Ambassador understands the
                            Japanese are in possession of it. He said that this hill affords an
                            artillery range not only across the Tumen River but to and beyond the
                            railroad running from Kashin on the coast to Hsinking, which is the
                            chief inlet and outlet of Japan into Manchuria and on into North China.
                            The Ambassador two or three times emphasized the view that his country
                            is very desirous of making this a local incident and nothing more; that
                            to this end his Government has proposed to the Soviet Government that
                            the two governments agree that, as a first step, fighting shall be
                            stopped; that they then agree on the withdrawal of troops from a given
                            area to be decided upon; that finally a commission be agreed upon which
                            would set about to solve the trouble. The Ambassador several times
                            repeated <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0481"/>his statement that
                            Litvinov is very incorrigible in effect; that he insists that before any
                            steps towards a cessation of clashes and fighting shall take place the
                            Japanese must withdraw from Changkuf eng hill and back beyond what the
                            Soviets claim is the present border line between the two countries. The
                            Ambassador said that he cannot fathom the mind of Litvinov in thus being
                            so disturbing. He then said that Litvinov might, of course, think that
                            the closer alliance between Great Britain and France would be calculated
                            to sever the alliance between France and Soviet Russia and therefore
                            they would make this demonstration in order to stimulate and unify and
                            encourage the Soviet people. He then said that Litvinov, of course,
                            might be prompted upon the theory that he would divert Japan from its
                            movements toward Hankow and other points in southern and central China;
                            that this idea could only be based upon the theory that Japan is more or
                            less worn down in her military strength and power.</p>
                        <p>I inquired as to how many troops the Russians have in this Pacific area
                            and he replied that they already had 250,000, have since increased the
                            number to 300,000, and are bringing in more troops from the interior of
                            the Soviet Union. I inquired how many aeroplanes the Soviets have in
                            this area, and he replied 1000. He then answered another question by
                            saying that the Soviets have a number of submarines near Vladivostok.
                            The Ambassador said that several Soviet aeroplanes have flown over Korea
                            up to Rashin and Yuki and have dropped some bombs, including some on an
                            interior point between; but that Japan has declined to send up a single
                            aeroplane thus far. The Ambassador appeared very much worried about the
                            offensive attitude of the Soviets. He did not say whether the Japanese
                            would go on in an effort to hold the Changkuf eng hill or whether they
                            would give way in the interest of peace. He only repeated more than
                            twice Japan’s extreme desire to restrict this clash to a local
                            incident.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Shigemitsu accepted in full the first two proposals having
                            refused arbitration. Litvinov pointed out that the most effective
                            guarantee of the achievement of an agreement for redemarcation would be
                            the presence on the Commission of an unbiased disinterested umpire but
                            in view of the objection of the Ambassador he did not insist upon
                            arbitration. This agreement is considered to have been reached on the
                            third point also.</p>
                        <p>An agreement was not reached on the question of the basis of the work of
                            the Commission for Redemarcation. Ambassador Shigemitsu proposed to use
                            as a basis also other material which up to the present time had not been
                            presented to the Soviet Union and concerning which it therefore had no
                            knowledge. Mr. Shigemitsu promised however to inquire of his Government
                            on this question and to amicably answer at the earliest possible
                            moment.</p>

                        <p>254. My telegram No. 245, August 10, 3 p.m.<note n="29" xml:id="d477fn29"
                                >Not printed.</note> There has been no further editorial comment on
                            the Japanese conflict and reference thereto in the Soviet press has been
                            confined to the publication of favorable foreign comment. This favorable
                            reaction is also reflected in Soviet circles.</p>
                        <p>Although judging from the communiqué issued on August 11 the conclusion
                            reached in the conversation between Litvinov and the Japanese Ambassador
                            wherein the cessation of hostilities was agreed upon represented to some
                            extent a compromise on both sides, it is generally regarded that
                            Litvinov’s proposal constituted at least a diplomatic recession from the
                            position which he had maintained up to that moment.</p>
                        <p>Litvinov had firmly insisted upon the withdrawal [of] the Japanese troops
                            from the territory under contention and upon the recognition by the
                            Japanese of the line drawn on the map annexed to the Hunchun Treaty. On
                            the basis of the Soviet military communiqué (see my 237, August 7, 11
                            p.m., and 247, August 11, 10 [<hi rend="italic">9</hi>] a.m.) it would
                            appear that the tactical position of the Soviets was less favorable on
                            August 10 than on August 7 inasmuch as Japanese troops were admitted to
                            be on Soviet territory on the former date. Litvinov however agreed on
                            August 10th to a cessation of hostilities without apparently insisting
                            upon complete satisfaction as to the conditions hitherto maintained by
                            him. The query therefore arises as to the reasons which prompted this
                            modification of the former position.</p>
                        <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0484"/>
                        <p>In foreign circles here the opinion is prevalent that military
                            developments constituted an important factor in the final negotiations.
                            According to this view, Litvinov had been instructed by the Kremlin, on
                            the assumption that the Japanese did not want war, to adopt a firm stand
                            in his conversations with the Japanese Ambassador and, even in the face
                            of the serious possibilities inherent in such tactics, not to deviate
                            from that stand, during the course of the military operations, unless so
                            instructed. On August 10th, however, notwithstanding the implications of
                            the communiqués, the military situation was apparently found to be in
                            fact favorable to the Soviets with the added possibility that reinforced
                            opposition from the Japanese side might jeopardize that advantage and
                            therefore a cessation of hostilities was regarded as acceptable or
                            desirable from the Soviet point of view. Litvinov therefore was ordered
                            by the Kremlin to bring about a quick termination of the deadlock in the
                            dispute although it involved a certain compromise of the diplomatic
                            position heretofore maintained by the Soviet Government and accordingly
                            the accord outlined in the communiqué of August 11 was reached. In
                            support of this view attention is called to the rapidity in which the
                            decision was apparently put into operation as evidenced by the lack of
                            information in military circles as to the actual termination of
                            hostilities on August 11 (see my 249, August 11, 11 a.m.<note n="30"
                                xml:id="d477fn30">Not printed.</note>).</p>
                        <p>In regard to the controversy as a whole, aside from the simple
                            explanation that the incident arose from and was developed on the basis
                            of the local issues involved, with special reference to the strategic
                            importance of the disputed position, the possibility is also suggested
                            that the Political Bureau was interested in exploiting the effect
                            throughout the world and in Central Europe in particular of a
                            demonstration of force on the part of the Soviet Union. On the other
                            hand, it is suggested that as the incident developed the Japanese were
                            not averse to making a reconnaissance of the present fighting ability
                            and morale of the Red Army at the present time and that furthermore the
                            Kwantung Army for its part was ready to engage in a reconnaissance of
                            this nature on the Far Eastern front. These factors may be more clearly
                            developed in the course of the process of negotiating the concrete
                            questions as to frontier and treaty matters which are still involved in
                            a final settlement of the present controversy.</p>
                        <p>A more comprehensive evaluation however of the various considerations
                            which may have prompted the Soviet Government throughout this
                            controversy would depend upon a clearer definition of the policy of the
                            Japanese Government than the negotiations here have so far revealed and

                        <p>255. My 254, August 14, 2 p.m. The following is translation of a Tass
                            communiqué entitled “Concerning the Events in the Region of Lake Khasan”
                            published today.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>At the first meeting of the military representatives of the Soviet
                                Union and Japan on August 11 of this year the military authorities
                                of the Soviet Union declared that despite the cessation of military
                                activities on August 11 at 1:30 p.m. local time a unit of Japanese
                                forces had violated the agreement concerning the truce and taking
                                advantage of the truce had advanced forward 100 meters and occupied
                                a portion of the northern slope of the Height Zaozernaya
                                (Changkufeng). Despite the protest of the military representatives
                                of the Soviet Union and their demand for the immediate withdrawal of
                                the Japanese forces to their previous position Japanese military
                                representatives categorically refused to carry out this legal
                                demand. In view of the fact that on the sector indicated the forces
                                of both sides are perhaps within 4 or 5 meters of each other and
                                that armed conflict might spontaneously be renewed at any moment,
                                the military representatives of both sides on the spot decided
                                mutually at this place to withdraw the forces of each side to a
                                distance of 80 meters. On receiving information to this effect the
                                Soviet command in the Far East in conformity with the agreement
                                concluded concerning a truce issued orders for the immediate return
                                of our units to their previous positions which they occupied at
                                midnight on August 10 with instructions to demand from the Japanese
                                authorities the withdrawal of the Japanese forces. This instruction
                                was carried out by our command.</p>
                            <p>At the same time Litvinov brought this violation of the truce by the
                                Japanese forces to the attention of the Japanese Ambassador and
                                demanded that they withdraw in this sector not less than 100 meters
                                and warned that unless this was carried out then the Government of
                                the Soviet Union would consider the truce had been violated through
                                the fault of Japan.</p>
                            <p>At the moment the Japanese forces have been withdrawn from the above
                                mentioned point.</p>
                            <p>On August 12 and 13 meetings again took place between the military
                                representatives of the Soviet Union and Japan who fixed the
                                disposition of the forces of both sides. However, the proposal of
                                the military representatives of the Soviet Union on August 13 to
                                sign a protocol and map fixing the disposition of the forces of both
                                sides was refused by the Japanese military representative who
                                declared that they were <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0486"
                                />awaiting instructions from their high authorities and that another
                                more authoritative commission will probably arrive for that
                                purpose.</p>
                            <p>Thereupon the military representatives of both sides separated. No
                                new meetings took place on August 14. The region of the conflict is
                                quiet at the present time. On August 13 at the request of the
                                Japanese military representatives and with the agreement of the
                                military representatives of the Soviet Union a mutual exchange of
                                dead took place. According to the calculations of the command on the
                                Soviet side, there were 236 dead and 611 wounded. According to the
                                estimation of our command the losses of the Japanese forces amounted
                                to 600 dead and 2500 wounded.</p>

                        <p>501. 1. American correspondent of the Associated Press who has just
                            returned from Changkufeng area states that: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                            Following minor skirmishes the first serious fighting occurred July 29,
                            when Soviet planes bombed the railway along the Tumen River; (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) Soviet troops which had momentarily occupied
                            Changkufeng Hill were subsequently driven off the hill by Japanese under
                            instructions; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Soviet troops who had taken the
                            hill and succeeded at least once and possibly twice in reoccupying a
                            part or all of the hill temporarily; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Japanese
                            troops were in occupation of the crest of the hill when hostilities
                            ceased which made them victors in a military sense; (<hi rend="italic"
                                >e</hi>) the Japanese also gained a diplomatic victory in that,
                            although the original Russian contention was that the boundary went
                            through the crest of Changkufeng, by the truce arrangements the boundary
                            accepted by the respective forces was east of Changkufeng Hill and
                            between the hill and the lake which is east of the hill. He said he
                            thought that Soviet casualties were, as stated by the Japanese, far
                            greater than Japanese casualties because the Soviet troops made several
                            attacks over difficult terrain including swamps at either end of the
                            lake, but Japanese statements concerning bombing of Korean villages were
                            questionable as there was little actual damage to civilian life and
                            property. Three disabled Soviet tanks were visible on the hill but no
                            facilities were provided to enable a view of Soviet planes stated to
                            have been brought down, which he believed to have been three in number.
                            He said that the accuracy of Soviet artillery and the speed of Soviet
                            planes were remarkable and that both could easily have done more damage
                            to the Japanese side if the Soviet had evidently not wished to aggravate
                            the situation too greatly.</p>

                        <p>2. He said (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the fighting on the Japanese side
                            was done by the Korean Army; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the Kwantung
                            Army was now massing large numbers of troops near the border and
                            expected further trouble; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) military and
                            civilian Japanese in Manchuria generally did not connect the border
                            incidents with the hostilities in China but considered them as a
                            separate problem arising from the General Lyushikov<note n="31"

                            is, the alleged Lyushikov’s statements derogatory of the Soviet military
                            establishment made it seem necessary to the Far Eastern Soviet
                            commanders (1) to demonstrate to Stalin that they were loyal to him and
                            prepared to defend Soviet territory, and (2) to demonstrate to the
                            Japanese that the report of their weakness was false and that they were
                            prepared for any contingencies.</p>
                        <p>3. He said that in his opinion further serious friction between Soviet
                            and Japanese troops were inevitable.</p>

                        <p>260. My 255, August 15, noon. Tass report published in Soviet press today
                            stated that the Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Moscow has informed
                            the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs that the agreement for a
                            truce in the region of Lake Khasan has been put into effect and that the
                            forces of both sides at the present time are at some distance from each
                            other. The communiqué adds that, in view of the foregoing, the Japanese
                            Embassy had proposed that should further questions arise which require
                            meetings between the representatives of the Japanese and Soviet military
                            commands, such meetings should be arranged through diplomatic
                            conversations between Moscow and Tokyo and that the Counselor of the
                            Japanese Embassy was informed that this proposal was acceptable.</p>

                        <p>267. My 260, August 18, 11 a.m. I understand that in the course of the
                            negotiations between Litvinov and the Japanese Ambassador <pb n="484"
                                xml:id="pg_484" facs="0488"/>during the past few days an agreement
                            was reached as to delegates of the Boundary Commission to discuss the
                            frontier in the region of Lake Khasan. The question however of the
                            nature of the documents and other evidence admissible as a basis of the
                            work of the Commission is apparently still pending as Litvinov insists
                            that the accords concluded between Russia and China with the maps
                            annexed thereto should be the sole basis for negotiation whereas the
                            Japanese Ambassador maintains that other material should be considered
                            as well.</p>

                            despatch No. 1577 of August 18, 1938,<note n="32" xml:id="d482fn32">Not
                                printed.</note> and to previous correspondence regarding the recent
                            Soviet-Japanese hostilities in the vicinity of Changkufeng on the
                            Soviet-Manchurian border, I have the honor to inform the Department that
                            no further information has been published in the Soviet press regarding
                            the appointment of the members of the commission agreed upon for the
                            demarcation of the area in dispute, nor regarding the still moot point
                            as to the data which the commission is to take into consideration in the
                            performance of its task. The Embassy has been reliably informed,
                            however, that conversations on this subject, which have been progressing
                            between the Japanese Ambassador, Mr. Shigemitsu, and Mr. Litvinov, have
                            been interrupted by the departure of Mr. Litvinov on September 5 for
                            Geneva. It has been learned from the Japanese Embassy here that
                            substantial agreement has been reached concerning the personnel of the
                            commission and that announcement with regard thereto will shortly be
                            made. It would appear, however, that the matters affecting the
                            composition of the commission and its work have been relegated for the
                            time being at least to a place of relative unimportance and that little
                            publicity regarding the functioning of the commission need be
                            expected.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of information which has been made available here the
                            attitude of Germany has been made more clear in relation to the
                            hostilities which recently ceased and in particular with regard to the
                            scope of any obligations which might have been expected of it by <pb

                            appears that the German Foreign Minister, Herr von Ribbentrop, during
                            the earlier stages of the hostilities avoided seeing the Japanese
                            Ambassador owing to the German Government’s unwillingness to define too
                            closely its attitude toward the controversy. The Japanese Ambassador,
                            however, sought an interview so insistently that he was at last received
                            by Herr von Ribbentrop at his country place and given merely
                            non-committal expressions of the sympathetic attitude of Germany toward
                            Japan. According to the Embassy’s information the Ambassador
                            subsequently conveyed to representatives of the press that the Foreign
                            Minister had given him assurances of more than moral support for Japan
                            on the part of Germany. When word of this reached Herr von Ribbentrop he
                            is stated to have sent for the Ambassador and informed him that the
                            press reports were at variance with the facts of their conversation and
                            that Germany would not only not render material assistance but counseled
                            Japan’s moderation in relation to the incident.</p>
                        <p>The Changkufeng incident has received no attention from the Soviet press
                            since the date of my despatch above mentioned other than an occasional
                            article containing comment laudatory of the Soviet troops and giving
                            details of some of the fighting.</p>

                        <p>387. Voroshilov, People’s Commissar for Defence, in a speech delivered on
                            Red Square November 7 published in <hi rend="italic">Izvestiya</hi>
                            today in referring to the Lake Khasan incident characterized the
                            Japanese as “our stupid neighbors” and reminded them and “all other
                            restless and impertinent enemies” that the next time they attempted to
                            violate Soviet territory the Red Army would not be obligated to confine
                            military action to the area attacked by the enemy but that it “is more
                            convenient and easier for us to crush the enemy on his own territory.”
                            This warning was also contained in the <hi rend="italic">Pravda</hi> and
                                <hi rend="italic">Izvestiya</hi> editorials today. Voroshilov
                            continued that the fighting forces of the Soviet Union were fully aware
                            of the present situation and that consequently they were continually
                            perfecting their defence.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to forward herewith a
                            copy of the Warsaw <hi rend="italic">Monitor Polski</hi>, the official
                            journal of the Polish Republic, dated December 7, 1938, which contains
                            on pages 2–4 the text in the English language of the notes exchanged at
                            Tokyo on October 19, 1938, between <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487"
                                facs="0491"/>the Polish and the Manchukuoan Ambassadors at that
                            capital providing for consular relations and regulating right of
                            establishment and trade between Poland and “Manchukuo”.</p>
                        <p>Competent officials of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated to
                            the Embassy that this exchange of communications “is not regarded as
                            constituting formal recognition of ‘Manchukuo’ by Poland, but rather as
                            meeting in a practical way the problems inevitably arising out of the
                            residence in ‘Manchukuo’ of numerous Polish nationals and the trade
                            between Poland and ‘Manchukuo’.” I understand that the British Embassy
                            at Warsaw inquired of the Polish Foreign Office whether this exchange
                            amounted to recognition and was informed that it did not in words
                            somewhat similar to those used in the later comment to a member of my
                            staff and quoted above. Officials of the Foreign Office likewise
                            observed that this exchange had been improperly interpreted in some
                            circles in implying to Poland the intent to recognize “Manchukuo”
                            thereby.</p>
                        <p>It is, however, quite generally accepted at Warsaw, as pointed out in my
                            despatch No. 741 of October 19, 1938,<note n="36" xml:id="d485fn36">Not
                                printed.</note> that Poland by this exchange has paved the way for
                                <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> recognition of “Manchukuo” and that
                            such recognition will take place in the not too distant future unless
                            unforeseen events of political character interfere to make such action
                            highly undesirable from the Polish point of view.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to the Department’s
                            instruction 1509 of May 28, 1938 on the subject of the failure of the
                            South Manchuria Railway and its subsidiary organizations to discharge
                            certain obligations to American nationals and firms, I have the honor to
                            enclose herewith translation of a note from the Japanese Foreign Office
                            under date of December 15, 1938<note n="37" xml:id="d486fn37">Not
                                printed. The note stated that the pensions in question were
                                discontinued under a regulation that pensions would be terminated if
                                the recipient resided over a year in any place outside the Soviet
                                Union or China and that the decision of the courts mentioned in the
                                Embassy’s note was given in 1927 prior to the application of this
                                regulation and therefore was considered to have no connection in
                                this case.</note> in response to the Embassy’s inquiry of June 16,
                            1938.</p>
                        <p>When the Embassy received the Department’s instruction, information with
                            regard to failure of payment of pensions had already come <pb n="488"
                                xml:id="pg_488" facs="0492"/>to the Embassy from the Embassy at
                            Peiping, on the basis of which this Embassy had addressed a third person
                            note to the Japanese Foreign Office on June 16, 1938. The discretionary
                            authorization contained in the Department’s instruction was therefore
                            not immediately availed of, the Embassy deciding instead to await reply
                            of the Japanese Foreign Office. In the months which have intervened, the
                            Foreign Office has repeatedly assured the Embassy that a reply would be
                            received within a week’s time, and in consequence further action was
                            postponed.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office’s reply raises a question of fact with regard to the
                            court decision cited, and the Embassy will make inquiry into the matter
                            before taking further action.</p>

                        <p>3. During my conversation this morning with the Foreign Secretary,<note
                                n="39" xml:id="d487fn39">Anthony Eden.</note> he mentioned that he
                            had seen the Chinese Ambassador last night and that with reference to
                            the forthcoming meeting of the League Council the Ambassador had asked
                            for his views regarding the Committee of Twenty-three. Mr. Eden told the
                            Chinese Ambassador that he felt there was no real work under present
                            circumstances for the Committee to do and that it would be a mistake for
                            it to be convened without the interested governments having been sounded
                            out beforehand. Mr. Eden suggested in particular to the Chinese
                            Ambassador that he get in touch with his own colleagues at Washington
                            and Paris with a view to ascertaining the views of the United States and
                            French Governments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Eden will leave Monday for a holiday in the south of France and
                            possibly may not return to England until after the meeting of the League
                            Council on January 17 which he will attend. It is understood that in his
                            absence the Prime Minister<note n="40" xml:id="d487fn40">Neville
                                Chamberlain.</note> will be in direct charge of the Foreign

                        <p>6. My 3, January 1, 5 p.m. A conversation at the Foreign Office last
                            evening threw some additional light on the rather general statement made
                            to me by the Foreign Secretary on January 1st regarding his conversation
                            with the Chinese Ambassador. It seems that the Chinese Ambassador had
                            spoken to Mr. Eden of the forthcoming meeting of the League Council and
                            had asked for his view regarding the advisability of calling for a
                            meeting of the Advisory Committee of Twenty-three which the delegations,
                            it was said, obviously desired should take place. The Chinese Ambassador
                            had made it sufficiently clear that the object of a meeting of the
                            Advisory Committee in his view was that it should serve as a preclude
                                [<hi rend="italic">prelude?</hi>] to a proposal for imposing
                            sanctions on Japan and specifically sanctions on oil. He evidently hoped
                            for favorable reaction from Mr. Eden. As stated at the Foreign Office,
                            Mr. Eden’s reply to the Ambassador was definitely intended to discourage
                            him from any such idea, for he pointed out to him the impracticability
                            of raising such a question at this time and the serious complications
                            which might result therefrom in Anglo-American, Anglo-French and
                            Anglo-Dutch relations. He also advised the Chinese Ambassador that in
                            his opinion there was no real work which the Advisory Committee could do
                            to good purpose at this time and that before the Ambassador considered
                            such a step as requesting the Committee to convene he should be very
                            sure what the reaction of the principal interested powers would be. It
                            was to this end that Mr. Eden suggested to him that he should, through
                            his colleagues in Washington and Paris, endeavor to ascertain the views
                            of the United States and French Governments.</p>
                        <p>I was told also that the Soviet Ambassador recently informed Mr. Eden
                            that his Government has been able to provide a certain amount of war
                            material for China but not very much and that he, the Soviet Ambassador,
                            supposed that Great Britain, France and the United States were doing
                            likewise within certain limits. The Ambassador expressed his opinion
                            that unless aid in war material could reach China from foreign sources,
                            her struggle against Japan was a hopeless one. Mr. Eden, it seems,
                            concurred in this opinion. The Foreign Office pointed out to me,
                            however, that in fact there are no supplies of war material except
                            rifles and a certain number of Lewis guns, which are available for
                            export from this country; that it was impossible for British sources to
                            furnish Chinese requirements in aircraft <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490"
                                facs="0494"/>or submarines which had been requested by the Chinese
                            Ambassador. The present scale and progress of British rearmament make
                            the prompt supply of any such material impossible.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing was given me simply as confidential information which might
                            possibly be of interest to the Department.</p>

                        <p>13. Having heard a report that the Chinese were considering making a
                            request for the reconvening of the Advisory Committee I took occasion to
                            inquire of Hoo<note n="41" xml:id="d489fn41">Victor Chitsai Hoo, Chinese
                                Minister in Switzerland.</note> regarding this possibility. He told
                            me in confidence that the representatives of certain governments were in
                            favor of reconvening the Advisory Committee while others were suggesting
                            the possibility of a further meeting of the Brussels Conference.<note

                            He added, however, while he could not say definitely what action would
                            be decided upon, in his personal opinion he did not think the Committee
                            of Twenty-three would be convened since it was difficult to see what
                            could be obtained from this action nor did he see at the moment the
                            probability of a reconvening of the Brussels Conference. He also said
                            that Litvinoff,<note n="43" xml:id="d489fn43">Maxim Litvinov, Soviet

                        <p>He concluded by saying that China was anxious to obtain some form of
                            assistance and that Koo would probably make a declaration before the
                            Council, the tenor of which has not yet been decided and may depend on
                            the result of the meeting this afternoon. Hoo promises to keep me

                        <p>18. Lord Cranborne<note n="46" xml:id="d490fn46">British Parliamentary
                                Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.</note> having
                            expressed the desire to see me, I called on him this afternoon. He was
                            with Mr. Stevenson of the British delegation.</p>
                        <p>Lord Cranborne said that he was terribly sorry to hear that the
                                Minister<note n="47" xml:id="d490fn47">Leland Harrison.</note> was
                            ill and therefore was not in Geneva and said that he would be glad if I
                            would give him a message on his behalf. He said that the British,
                            French, Russians, and Chinese had had a meeting this morning and that
                            the Chinese were pressing for some further action on the part of
                            League.</p>
                        <p>He said that it was pretty definite that a Council resolution would be
                            presented reaffirming the resolution adopted by the Committee of
                            Twenty-three and by the Assembly and in addition calling upon states to
                            collaborate in the action recommended by that Committee of necessity of
                            “refraining from taking any action which might have the effect of
                            weakening China’s power of resistance.”<note n="48" xml:id="d490fn48"

                            out that such collaboration would mean the end of efforts of
                            conciliation. He said that the Chinese had been anxious to apply article
                                17<note n="49" xml:id="d490fn49">Of the League Covenant, <ref

                            regalia” which would, of course, pave the way toward sanctions. This,
                            Lord Cranborne felt, was difficult and perhaps dangerous since Japan
                            would in all probability refuse an invitation to appear and state her
                            case and would probably not be favorably received. The Chinese finally
                            pressed for “one small step in advance,” that is, consultation regarding
                            such collaboration.</p>
                        <p>The question of possible consultation remained to be considered. He
                            emphasized the fact that no decision had been reached in this respect
                            although he felt that in the event a resolution calling for
                            collaboration of states to refrain from hindering China was adopted the
                            Chinese would immediately press for the further step to consult as to
                            what means this collaboration should take.</p>
                        <p>Such consultation could take one of four forms: (1) By a reconvening of
                            the Committee of Twenty-three which Cranborne thought was unwise since
                            he did not feel that very much could be accomplished by this means; (2)
                            a reconvening of the Brussels Conference which he thought was perhaps a
                            better move; (3) a private and informal meeting <pb n="492"
                                xml:id="pg_492" facs="0496"/>of interested governments which would
                            presumably include the United States; and (4) some committee set up by
                            the Council.</p>
                        <p>He said that Eden was anxious at all costs to avoid embarrassing the
                            United States and that he felt it wise to inform Harrison of the
                            situation in order that Washington might be “tipped off.” He said that
                            the British position had always been at Brussels and elsewhere that they
                            were prepared to take such action as they felt would be effective but
                            were not prepared to take action which they felt would not be
                            effective.</p>
                        <p>He said that while one object of the Chinese was to obtain a political
                            gesture another was perhaps that the Chinese wanted to line up the
                            various interested powers to see to what extent they could receive aid
                            from each, that is, that they would say that they needed so many guns,
                            so many tanks, so many airplanes, et cetera, and would then ask each
                            power what it could supply although he thought that inquiries of this
                            kind had already been addressed to those governments.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the conversation Cranborne was evidently anxious to obtain any
                            indication of what the American attitude would be with regard, to the
                            new Chinese move. I refrained from saying anything more than that I
                            would be glad to transmit the information to Mr. Harrison.</p>
                        <p>Cranborne concluded by saying that he was most anxious to keep the United
                            States Government fully informed and to avoid in any way embarrassing it
                            and that he would continue to keep it informed of any developments.</p>
                        <p>I telephoned the above information to the Minister in Bern who asked me
                            to telegraph it to the Department and to explain that he has been ill
                            with sinus but hopes to be able to get about within the next few
                            days.</p>
                        <p>Department’s instructions are requested.</p>
                        <p>Later in the afternoon Stevenson informed me that Cranborne wished to
                            speak to me again and I was received by Eden and Cranborne.</p>
                        <p>Eden said that following Cranborne’s conversation with me there had been
                            another meeting later this evening and that after an extended discussion
                            particularly with regard to the last paragraph the following draft
                            resolution was agreed upon subject to approval of the British and French
                            Governments: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    weakening China’s power of resistance and thus of increasing her
                                    difficulties in the present conflict and should also consider
                                    how far they can individually extend aid to China;</p>

                        <p>Eden remarked that if this draft was approved by the governments it would
                            be passed at the meeting of the Council tomorrow morning. Following this
                            action one of the two following procedures would be adopted: (1) the
                            three powers, Great Britain, France and Russia would consult and then
                            make some joint approach to other interested powers, principally
                            intervening [<hi rend="italic">interviewing?</hi>] United States and
                            Holland, or (2) that these two governments would be approached through
                            the usual diplomatic channels. He said that for himself he very much
                            favored approaching the governments through diplomatic channels since
                            the first alternative had too much the flavor of presenting an agreed
                            upon program by joint or concerted action. He inquired what I thought my
                            Government would prefer. I replied that I was unfortunately not in a
                            position to express an opinion whereupon he said that he thought he
                            would take it upon himself to say in the private Council meeting
                            preceding the public session tomorrow that in his opinion the second
                            alternative would be much more agreeable to the United States
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>In discussing the draft resolution he said that he thought that on the
                            whole it was not a bad draft and laughingly remarked that no punitive
                            measures of any kind were mentioned and that the action contemplated
                            might even take the form of consultation with Japan for example or any
                            other of a dozen different procedures. He said that Delbos had remarked
                            that the resolution meant in fact that they were afraid to shake the bad
                            boy out of the tree but that if they could get another and powerful
                            partner they would shake him out very quickly. I received the impression
                            that the draft resolution was more agreeable to the English than to the
                            French who apparently preferred certain changes. Eden said that he
                            thought that the present plan would rather wipe out the other
                            possibilities of consultation described to me by Cranborne and set forth
                            in the first part of this telegram.</p>

                        <p>20. My 18, January 28, 9 p.m. The Polish permanent delegate telephoned
                            this morning and asked me to come around as soon as possible. He said
                            that he wanted to speak very privately and unofficially and asked if I
                            could say whether the attitude of the United States Government with
                            regard to the Sino-Japanese dispute had grown any stronger since the
                            Brussels Conference and if they were now prepared to take a stronger
                            line. He said that the British delegation were telling him that this was
                            the case but that his own information did not support this.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I regretted that I was not in a position to express any
                            opinion with regard to any change in the attitude of the American
                            Government which has been consistent all along.</p>
                        <p>Komarnicki then went on to say that he objected very much to the way the
                            British, French, and Russians were attempting to put over the draft
                            resolution in the Council, which he considered not only objectionable
                            but highly dangerous. If it was decided to apply article 16, well and
                            good, but to ask him to agree to and give his blessing to Soviet aid to
                            China which might reach dangerous proportions was something that he did
                            not feel he could do. Such a resolution would be subject to many
                            interpretations and he felt that some of these interpretations might be
                            exceedingly dangerous. His attitude would probably be greatly changed if
                            he had any assurance that the United States Government were in favor of
                            or interested in such a resolution and its implications but failing this
                            he opposed it bitterly.</p>
                        <p>He went on to say that the British-French-Russian move was pure bluff;
                            that Eden, Beylard [<hi rend="italic">Litvinov?</hi>], Delbos were
                            anxious to achieve a personal triumph in the Council so that they could
                            go home to their governments and point with pride to what they had
                            achieved here but that for his own part he did not feel that conference
                            of [<hi rend="italic">or?</hi>] his Government should or could
                            contribute to such a bluff. It was impossible for Poland to be a pawn in
                            a political game which did not concern her and which contained such
                            dangerous possibilities.</p>
                        <p>Poland he said objected to having three powers sit down in secret, decide
                            upon a draft and then present it to the other members of the Council for
                            them simply to accept whether they liked it or not. On what article of
                            the Covenant was this draft resolution based? What was hoped to be
                            accomplished by it? Poland had the greatest moral sympathy for China but
                            a war between China and Japan did not directly affect Poland. He had no
                            intention of voting for a resolution which might bless a Russian
                            adventure with Japan.</p>
                        <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0499"/>
                        <p>I repeated that I was not in a position to express any opinion on the
                            subject of either the draft resolution or of any change in the American
                            French [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].</p>
                        <p>Council meeting has been postponed until 5 this afternoon.</p>

                        <p>6. The Chinese Ambassador<note n="50" xml:id="d492fn50">C. T.
                                Wang.</note> has just called and asked what our attitude would be
                            toward a further Nine Power Treaty Conference. I told the Ambassador
                            that the answer to this question was self-evident. I added, however,
                            that of course if there should be called a duly constituted meeting of
                            the parties to the Nine Power Treaty<note n="51" xml:id="d492fn51"

                            by way of illustration there should be called in a duly constituted way
                            a meeting of the Advisory Committee, the American Government would
                            follow its previous practice. I then emphasized to the Ambassador that
                            the really important consideration in connection with matters of this
                            sort was whether any useful purpose would be served by the calling of a
                            conference or a meeting, and whether the interests of peace in general
                            as well as the interests of China would be furthered. I said that the
                            Ambassador knew the importance of those preliminary questions as well as
                            I. I pointed out that assembling of conferences or committees with
                            achievement of nothing definite or constructive serves only to harm the
                            cause of peace. I referred to a press report from Geneva that various
                            foreign governments contemplate approaching the American Government in
                            regard to a proposal to extend credits to China for the purchase of arms
                            and munitions. I said to the Ambassador that he knew the situation in
                            this country in regard to a question of that sort and that I of course
                            assumed that the representatives of any governments which might have
                            presented to them for consideration any such plan would have knowledge
                            and understanding of the situation here in this regard.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that the Chinese Ambassador here may cable a report of his
                            conversation with me to the Chinese representative at Geneva and that as
                            a result you may be approached by the representative of some government
                            interested in the matter. In such event you should be guided by the
                            foregoing and discreetly discourage any impression that this Government
                            feels that any useful purpose would be served by a reconvening of the
                            Brussels Conference at this time.</p>

                        <p>22. My telegram No. 18, January 28, 9 p.m. Stevenson of the British
                            delegation has just informed me that following extended discussion this
                            morning the last paragraph of the draft resolution has now been changed
                            to read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Is confident that those states represented on the Council for
                                    whom the situation is of special interest will lose no
                                    opportunity of examining, in consultation with other similarly
                                    interested powers the possibility of any further steps which may
                                    contribute to a just settlement of the conflict in the Far
                                    East”.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Stevenson said that this change had been largely due to the insistence of
                            the French although the British had also accepted it. Koo was apparently
                            rather unhappy at the change which he considers weakens an already weak
                            statement. The amended resolution will now be referred to the Chinese
                            Government for approval. It is expected that opposition will continue in
                            the Council to the resolution even as amended. The principal opposition
                            it is thought comes from the Pole.</p>
                        <p>Stevenson explained that the object of the above change was to make the
                            resolution “less imperative” as far as the United States was
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>In view of the above the Sino-Japanese conflict will not be considered at
                            this afternoon’s session of the Council and will be postponed at least
                            until Monday and perhaps even later if no agreement can be arrived at by
                            that time.</p>

                        <p>23. My January 29, 4 p.m. Hoo, the Chinese permanent delegate, said this
                            evening that he presumed that I had read both the first draft of the
                            proposed Council resolution and the amendment. <pb n="497"
                                xml:id="pg_497" facs="0501"/>I said that I had. He asked if I could
                            express any opinion as to the reaction of my Government. I explained
                            that I was not in a position to express any opinion whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>Hoo then went on to say that the French had been insistent upon weakening
                            the draft resolution and as far as he could see were not willing to do
                            anything at the moment due to the fact that they feared an Italian
                            belligerent act sometime in March. He said that as an excuse they kept
                            repeating that they could not do anything because the United States was
                            unfavorable toward any action and would be unwilling to cooperate in any
                            way but that he was convinced that the real reason was that they were
                            anxious about the European situation.</p>
                        <p>He said that Litvinoff had been very favorably disposed toward the
                            Chinese case and that even the British had appeared disposed to do at
                            least something but the French had been making all sorts of excuses and,
                            in addition to saying that they were unable to move because of the
                            United States’ attitude, had warned about the intransigent attitude that
                            the Poles would adopt if any strong resolution were agreed upon.</p>
                        <p>He promised to keep me informed of any developments.</p>
                        <p>Eden is expected to leave Geneva tonight.</p>
                        <p>With reference to my telegram 20, January 29, noon, I am informed by a
                            usually reliable source that Beck<note n="52" xml:id="d494fn52">Polish
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> has left Geneva and that when
                            the resolution is presented to the Council the Poles will abstain but
                            will take the opportunity to protest against a procedure whereby the

                        <p>26. Department’s telegram No. 6, January 29, 2 [<hi rend="italic">1</hi>]
                            p.m., my telegram No. 23, January 29, 4 [<hi rend="italic">7</hi>] p.m.
                            Stevenson of the British delegation informed me today that the status of
                            the Chinese Council resolution remained unchanged from yesterday. He
                            went on to say that as he had pointed out in our last conversation (see
                            my 22, January 29, 4 p.m.) the Chinese were rather unhappy over the
                            amendment of the last paragraph of the resolution but had referred it to
                            the Chinese Government from which no reply had yet been received. <pb
                                n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0502"/>He hoped and expected that the
                            Chinese would agree to it and would not be so “silly” as to attempt to
                            press an appeal under article 17 which procedure in his opinion would be
                            ill-advised. He continued that in the event a favorable Chinese reply
                            was received in time another Council meeting would probably be held
                            tomorrow afternoon. If the resolution was adopted by the Council he
                            expected that the next step would be for Moscow, London, and Paris to
                            consider what steps they were in a position to take which would most
                            likely be followed by an approach to Washington through diplomatic
                            channels to ascertain whether or not the American Government would join
                            in such steps as had been regarded as possible by the other three
                            governments.</p>
                        <p>Having previously discussed the Department’s 6, January 29, 2 [<hi
                                rend="italic">1</hi>] p.m., with the Minister in Bern, I took
                            advantage of an opportunity during the course of my conversation with
                            others to refer to the Secretary’s conversation with the Chinese
                            Ambassador saying that the Secretary in referring to our attitude toward
                            a further Nine Power Conference had said that he felt that the really
                            important thing was whether any useful purpose would be served by
                            further conferences or meetings and whether the interests of peace in
                            general as well as the interests of China would be thus furthered. I
                            added that the Secretary had pointed out that assembling of conferences
                            or committees with achievement of nothing definite or constructive
                            serves only to harm the cause of peace. Stevenson remarked that this
                            appeared to be a remarkably sound view of the matter.</p>

                                Ambassadors in the United Kingdom and France, respectively.</note>
                            informed me this morning that the amended Council resolution was
                            unacceptable to their Government. They said that the first resolution
                            was bad enough but that the second one was impossible; there would be
                            another meeting this afternoon of the representatives of China, Great
                            Britain, France and Soviet Russia. The Chinese were somewhat despondent
                            about what could be accomplished and said that they were in a most
                            difficult position and that perhaps it would be better to have no
                            resolution <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0503"/>at all if this was
                            the best that could be obtained. The French, they said, had consistently
                            tried to hold back the British from agreeing to any strong action saying
                            in effect that if the British were involved in the Far East what would
                            happen to poor France all by herself in the Mediterranean? They said it
                            was evident that France was greatly concerned with regard to possible
                            trouble with Italy.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese had been greatly concerned regarding press report from the
                            United States to the effect that France, Great Britain, Soviet Russia
                            and China were trying to cook up some program of furnishing money and
                            munitions to China which these states would attempt to force upon the
                            United States. These reports they described as completely without any
                            foundation.</p>
                        <p>They said that the American attitude was very well known and that there
                            was not and would not be any attempt to force the victim’s hand. They
                            said that the British had consistently insisted that nothing be done to
                            embarrass or displease the American Government. The Chinese also
                            described as fantastic reports that the Council had consulted the United
                            States Government with regard to the resolution and said that the facts
                            of the case were that all of the four powers now holding discussions on
                            the subject in Geneva had agreed that the United States Government
                            should be kept fully advised of any developments here purely for their
                            information and in the hope that we might be in a position to take some
                            parallel or independent action along the lines of anything that was
                            finally decided by the other three powers.</p>
                        <p>They asked me if I had received any reaction from my Government with
                            regard to the Council resolution or other developments in Geneva. I then
                            asked if they had had any report of the conversation that the Chinese
                            Ambassador in Washington had with the Secretary of State on Saturday.
                            They replied in the negative and I then explained that the Chinese
                            Ambassador had asked the Secretary what our attitude would be toward a
                            further Nine Power Treaty Conference and that the Secretary had replied
                            that if there should be called a duly constituted meeting of the powers
                            to the Nine Power Treaty the American Government would attend and if by
                            way of illustration there should be called a meeting of the Advisory
                            Committee the American Government would follow its previous practice. I
                            explained that the Secretary had emphasized that the really important
                            consideration in connection with matters of this sort was whether any
                            useful purpose would be served by the calling of conferences or a
                            meeting and whether the interests of peace in general as well as the
                            interests of China would be furthered. I concluded that the Secretary
                            had pointed out that assembling of conferences or committees with the
                            achievement of nothing definite or constructive serves <pb n="500"
                                xml:id="pg_500" facs="0504"/>only to harm the cause of peace. They
                            thanked me for telling them this and said that it seemed quite evident
                            that under present circumstances the Secretary felt that it would be
                            useless to have another meeting of the Nine Power Conference or a
                            further meeting of the Committee of Twenty-three.</p>
                        <p>A Council meeting is scheduled for 6 p.m., today.</p>

                                    aggression in China, the Chinese Government has been pursuing a
                                    legitimate and logical course in accordance with the Covenant of
                                    the League of Nations.</p>
                                <p>The efforts of the Chinese delegation at Geneva have been so
                                    directed and it is ridiculous to attribute to it the intention
                                    of maneuvering for the intervention of the United States of
                                    America. It is equally grotesque to say, as was reported in the
                                    press, that the Chinese delegation, or for that matter, any
                                    delegation attempted to involve France and the United States in
                                    the war in connection with the Sino-Japanese conflict.</p>
                                <p>During the deliberations of the members of the Council it was
                                    suggested—and the suggestion was an agreeable one to the Chinese
                                    delegation—that Washington should be informed as before of the
                                    discussions at Geneva as undoubtedly the United States have a
                                    very deep interest in the Far East. Such a step was considered
                                    all the more necessary as the results of the Geneva discussions
                                    would, it was hoped, furnish the American Government with useful
                                    elements for exercising its own judgment.</p>
                                <p>It is unnecessary to emphasize that the American policy of
                                    independent judgment and parallel action is well known here.
                                    Therefore recent reports which have appeared in the press
                                    implying or alleging that certain delegation or a group of
                                    delegations has been maneuvering to force the American
                                    Government to concerted action with the League are entirely
                                    unfounded.”</p>

                        <p>31. My 27, January 31, 1 p.m. I saw Cranborne immediately after the
                            Council meeting this afternoon and he referred to a reported statement
                            that the Secretary had given to the press regarding the American
                            attitude toward furnishing arms and munitions to China alone. I told him
                            that I had no knowledge of such statement. He said that he hoped that
                            the Chinese would now adopt the amended resolution and that he would let
                            me know as soon as any decision was arrived at.</p>
                        <p>Stevenson has just telephoned and informed me that at the meeting this
                            afternoon the four interested powers had after wrangling for 2 hours
                            agreed to a resolution. The first two paragraphs are the same as
                            reported in my No. 18, January 28, 9 p.m. The third paragraph has been
                            changed to read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Deplores the deterioration of the situation the more in view of
                                    the efforts and achievements of the National Government of China
                                    in her political and economic reconstruction”.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The fourth paragraph remains the same. A new fifth paragraph reads:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Calls the most serious attention of the members of the League to
                                    the terms of the above-mentioned resolution”.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The last paragraph remains practically the same except that the word
                            “feasibility” has been inserted in the place of “possibility” in the
                            last sentence.</p>
                        <p>Stevenson described the change in the third paragraph as a little bouquet
                            for the Chinese but said that the changes agreed upon made no difference
                            whatever in substance. The resolution is being circulated confidentially
                            tonight and will be considered by the Council at its meeting tomorrow
                            afternoon.</p>

                        <p>34. My 31, January 31, 10 p.m. The Council met in private session this
                            morning to discuss the Council resolution in the matter of the <pb
                                n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0506"/>Chinese appeal. Peru and
                            Ecuador objected to the resolution at some length, Ecuador in regard to
                            the last paragraph, saying that he must refer to his Government before
                            he could accept it and Peru protested against a few powers agreeing upon
                            such an important declaration and then submitting it for the acceptance
                            of the other members of the Council. It is now thought that Peru will
                            probably join Poland in abstaining when the matter is put to a vote in
                            public session while Ecuador’s position will depend upon the attitude of
                            his Government. A public meeting of the Council has been set tentatively
                            for 6 o’clock this evening but in the event that Ecuador’s position has
                            not been cleared up by that time it is possible that the meeting may be
                            postponed until noon tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the reported statement that the Secretary was supposed
                            to have given to the press regarding the American attitude towards arms
                            and ammunition to China mentioned in the first paragraph of my telegram
                            referred to above, it appears that the French stated that they had
                            received a telegram to the effect that the Secretary had made a very
                            strong statement to the press that the United States Government would
                            not in concert or alone furnish arms and ammunition to only one side in
                            the Sino-Japanese conflict. This the Secretary was supposed to have done
                            on Saturday.<note n="54" xml:id="d499fn54">January 29.</note> Since Lord
                            Cranborne had asked me to give him any press statement on this subject
                            that I might receive, I gave him a copy of the Secretary’s reply at his
                            press conference on Saturday to a question contained in Radio Bulletin
                            24, January 29 with regard to press reports from Geneva to the effect
                            that Great Britain, France and the Soviet Union had consented to help
                            arm China and were going to consult the United States on such a
                                decision.<note n="55" xml:id="d499fn55">From Department of State
                                press conference report: “The Secretary replied that no
                                communications had been received from any of these Governments on
                                this subject any more than we have any new foreign policy on this
                                subject.”</note> Cranborne commented that the French seemed rather
                            to have overdrawn the matter but that he hoped that the resolution as
                            agreed upon last night would go through without difficulty since he felt
                            that this would be agreeable to the United States Government. He asked
                            if I did not agree with him and I replied that I was not able to express
                            any opinion with regard to the matter.</p>

                            in my 31, January 31, 10 p.m., and declared the present session
                            closed.</p>
                        <p>Peru and Poland abstained largely because, they said, of the procedure
                            whereby a declaration of this nature was prepared in secret by a small
                            number of the members of the Council and then presented for their
                            acceptance without sufficient time to consider it or its
                            implications.</p>
                        <p>Ecuador accepted the resolution upon instructions from his Government. He
                            said that he had referred the matter to his Government because the
                            implications in the last paragraph had not been clear as to what
                            responsibilities might devolve upon Ecuador if she accepted it.</p>
                        <p>Koo brought the Chinese position up to date from the time of his last
                            summation to the Council and enumerated a list of Japanese atrocities
                            directed not only against the Chinese people but also the citizens and
                            interests of foreign powers in China. He also pointed to the fact that
                            unchecked Japanese aggression in China could only serve detrimentally to
                            affect the cause of peace in Europe. In accepting the resolution he said
                            that he did so confidently believing that greater effect than heretofore
                            will be given to the terms of the Assembly resolution referred to and
                            that the proposed examination will be pursued with energy and
                            promptness. He reserved his right to ask the League to adopt positive
                            measures under the Covenant and further stated that his acceptance was
                            also based upon the understanding that the Council remained seized of
                            the appeal of the Chinese Government invoking articles 10, 11 and 17 of
                            the Covenant.</p>
                        <p>Cranborne explained that the procedure followed had been adopted merely
                            to save time and that no one had any thought of disregarding the views
                            of any member of the Council.</p>

                            protesting against renewed indiscriminate bombing by Japanese planes of
                            open villages around Canton. The communication states “These continued
                            air bombings appear to us not only cruelty to humanity but also flagrant
                            defiance of League resolution as well as present strong world opinion

                            bringing up the nature of Japanese outrages in Sino-Japanese conflict.
                            Hoo asks that this be circulated to members of the League and to members

                        <p>93. I am reliably informed that in a secret session of the Council this
                            morning Koo pressed for mutual assistance to China and also asked that
                            an international commission be sent to the northern front to investigate
                            Chinese charges concerning the use of poison gas. The British are
                            understood to have demurred at the appointment of a commission of
                            inquiry but a committee of the Council has been appointed to draft a
                            resolution referring to the previous resolution on assistance to China
                            and urging both sides to refrain from the use of poison gas. It may also
                            contain some reference to recent Chinese successes. In this connection
                            the Japanese delegation has issued a press statement denying the Chinese
                            charges respecting poison gas and accusing the <pb n="505"
                                xml:id="pg_505" facs="0509"/>Chinese of making preparations for its
                            use. It is rumored that the British have agreed to discuss privately in
                            London a Chinese request for commercial credits.</p>

                        <p>95. The Council this evening in public session passed unanimously (Poland
                            abstaining) the following resolution: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>[“]The Council,</p>
                                <p>Having heard the statement by the representative of China on the

                                <p>I. Earnestly urges members of the League to do their utmost to
                                    give effect to the recommendations contained in previous
                                    resolutions of the Assembly and Council in this matter, and to
                                    take into serious and sympathetic consideration requests they
                                    may receive from the Chinese in conformity with the said
                                    resolution;</p>

                                    threatened by the Japanese invasion, and in the suffering which
                                    is thereby inflicted on her people.</p>
                                <p>II. Recalls that the use of toxic gases is a method of war
                                    condemned by international law, which cannot fail, should resort
                                    be had to it, to meet with the reprobation of the civilized
                                    world; and requests the governments of states who may be in a
                                    position to do so to communicate to the League any information
                                    that they may obtain on the subject.”</p>

                        <p>Koo said he accepted the resolution on the understanding that the Council
                            remain seized of the Chinese appeal under articles 10, 11 and 17 of the
                            Covenant. He made an appeal for “financial and material aid and
                            facilities for purchase, transport and transit of arms and military
                            supplies, facilities which should in no case be less than those which
                            she enjoyed before the commencement of the present hostilities with

                            “acting in accordance with the Assembly resolution and with the
                            resolutions of the Council, France has so far as was possible endeavored
                            to give her aid to China and any recommendation which the Council may in
                            this connection make to states members will be taken into very serious
                            and sympathetic consideration by France”. He then referred to the
                            intention <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0510"/>of the French
                            Government to make a considerable contribution to the anti-epidemic work
                            in China and called attention to the protection already accorded Chinese
                            refugees in the French Concession[s?].</p>

                            the United Kingdom imposes upon them to implement to the full their
                            obligations to China under these resolutions. I can assure Mr. Koo that
                            His Majesty’s Government will continue as they have done in the past to
                            give, in the words of our resolution today, serious and sympathetic

                            expressed themselves as pleased with the result of the Council’s action,
                            feeling that an advance had been made in their favor as compared with
                            previous sessions, particularly as regards the statements of Bonnet and
                            Halifax.</p>
                        <p>Koo informed Minister that Halifax had just told him that arrangements
                            for credits mentioned in my No. 93, May 13, 6 p.m., would be concluded
                            “in a manner satisfactory to the Chinese”.</p>

                            further communication to Secretary General containing additional
                            information concerning alleged use of poison gas by Japanese troops in
                            China. Communication states that after the first use of gas at Matang
                            gas has continued to be used on many occasions up to and including
                            present drive on Hankow. Note asks that communication be circulated to

                        <p>182. Hoo informs me that Chinese delegation has been instructed to press
                            for immediate application of article 17 of the Covenant probably at
                            meeting of new Council to be elected during Assembly. (The Council
                            remains seized of Chinese appeal under articles 10, 11 and 17.) He said
                            that China up to present had been persuaded not to press for application
                            of this article on grounds that they would receive help from individual
                            countries. This help had not been forthcoming and the Chinese were now
                            determined to insist upon immediate application of article 17.</p>
                        <p>He added that it had not yet been decided whether China would again raise
                            the question of Japanese aggression before the Assembly.</p>

                        <p>192. My telegram 182, September 8, 5 p.m. In a conversation with Quo
                            Tai-chi concerning the Chinese request for immediate application of
                            article 17 which has now been embodied in a formal note to the League,
                            he explained that China had so far refrained from insisting upon the
                            application of article 17 as a result of pleas of various members of the
                            League to save them from embarrassment and of promises of individual aid
                            for China. Now, however, since with the exception of Russia these
                            promises of aid had not been carried out, public opinion in China was
                            insisting upon some direct action on the part of the League and the
                            delegation had accordingly been instructed to press for the immediate
                            application of article 17.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that under present circumstances it would be highly
                            embarrassing for the League to agree with the Chinese request for an
                            application of article 17, which would automatically lead to article 16,
                            and equally embarrassing to the Chinese to have such a request refused,
                            it may well be that the present Chinese move is designed for bargaining
                            purposes and that they hope that by their insistence upon the
                            application of article 17 that Great Britain and France particularly may
                            be forced into more concrete measures of assistance to the Chinese
                            Government.</p>

                            various aspects of the war in China, Koo, in addition to requesting
                            financial and material aid to China, urged (1) the immediate application
                            of article 17; (2) an embargo against Japan of arms, munitions,
                            airplanes, oil, essential raw materials, and financial credits and (4)
                                [<hi rend="italic">3</hi>] measures to deter Japan from the use of
                            poison gas and the bombing of the civilian population. As regards the
                            third point he asked for the despatch of a commission of neutral
                            observers to watch the situation on different fronts and report to the
                            League for consideration.</p>

                        <p>208. My 192, September 13, 4 p.m. At a private meeting of the Council
                            today China requested early consideration of the Chinese appeal under
                            article 17. A reliable Secretariat official said he considered the
                            Chinese move as motivated partly for bargaining purposes and partly to
                            satisfy a growing anti-League sentiment in Government circles in China.
                            He considered it would be difficult for the Council to refuse to give an
                            invitation to Japan. Japan would almost certainly not accept but he felt
                            certain that no serious demand would be made for the application of
                            article 16. He did not know however what formula would be used to avoid
                            its automatically coming into effect. It will be noted that in
                            accordance with paragraph 3 of article 17, article 16 would be
                            applicable only after a formal recognition that Japan had resorted to
                            war. An allusion to this was made by Hoo in a recent conversation with
                            me who suggested that if formal recognition of a state of war should be
                            made it might have some bearing upon the application of the American
                            neutrality law.<note n="62" xml:id="d511fn62">As amended May 1, 1937; 50

                        <p>211. The Council today agreed to telegraph an invitation to the Japanese
                            Government in accordance with paragraph 1 of article 17. It was agreed
                            that no action in accordance with paragraph 2 of that article was
                            necessary at this time in view of the fact that an inquiry into the
                            circumstances of the dispute had already been made by the League.</p>

                        <p>212. My telegram 211, September 19, 7 p.m. I learn that at the private
                            meeting of the Council this afternoon no opposition was made to the
                            Chinese request for the application of article 17. Poland was not
                            represented on the Council on the ground it is understood that Poland’s
                            term has expired. It is believed here that the real explanation of
                            Poland’s taking this position is a desire to avoid being represented on
                            the Council in the event of a Czech appeal or protest to the League.</p>

                        <p>610. 1. No authoritative Japanese comment on the action of the Council of
                            the League in inviting Japan to accept the obligations of members in
                            settling its dispute with China is available. There is unanimous
                            expectation that the Cabinet, which will probably meet tomorrow, will
                            decide to reject the invitation.</p>
                        <p>2. Reports of the action by the League have not been prominently
                            displayed. First impressions here are that economic sanctions will not,
                            in the anticipated event of Japan’s refusal, be carried out and that the
                            action under reference is primarily a gesture calculated to mollify
                            China.</p>

                                Chung-hui.</note> invited me to see him this morning to tell me that
                            in view of probability that Japan would refuse invitation which League
                            is extending under article No. 17 of the Covenant, China would request
                            the League to apply article 16 which calls for sanctions. He said he was
                            anxious to know attitude of United States. Said China was looking to the
                            United States to take a leading and important part befitting its known
                            stand in any ultimate settlement of Far Eastern situation and expressed
                            belief that application by the League of sanctions against Japan under
                            article 16 would offer an opportunity to the United States to back up
                            action of the League by such parallel action as might be possible for
                            us. I attempted to explain legal difficulties involved but said that I

                        <p>Mr. Ing called by appointment. He said that the Ambassador had asked him
                            to call to inquire whether the American Government would be willing to
                            support the League action in invoking article 17 of <pb n="512"
                                xml:id="pg_512" facs="0516"/>the Covenant and whether the American
                            Government would take parallel action with members of the League to
                            impose sanctions to restrain aggressors and maintain the peace of the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>In reply, I said to Mr. Ing that the situation was not quite that which
                            one would take it to be from his questions; that according to our
                            information the League had, pursuant to Article 17 of the Covenant,
                            extended an invitation to Japan to accept the obligations of membership
                            in the League for the purposes of the Sino-Japanese dispute and that
                            newspaper reports stated that Japan had decided to decline this
                            invitation. I said further that, as Mr. Ing knew, questions relating to
                            Article 17 of the League Covenant were matters for consideration and
                            determination by the League and that this Government was not a member of
                            the League. I said that the general attitude and policy of this
                            Government had been made clear repeatedly; that they were known to the
                            Ambassador and to the Chinese Government and that I would therefore not
                            undertake to elaborate in regard to them. I mentioned several times that
                            the only action taken by the League so far was to address an invitation
                            to Japan pursuant to Article 17 of the Covenant. (My purpose in calling
                            attention to this fact was to indicate that until the League had decided
                            on the question of further action there existed only a hypothetical
                            basis for the questions which Mr. Ing had asked.) I said that I could
                            make no comment other than as indicated above. I said that I would,
                            however, make note of the questions propounded by the Chinese Government
                            and would bring those questions, together with the comments which I had
                            made, to the attention of higher officers of the Department.</p>
                        <p>Toward the end of his call Mr. Ing told me that he was asking these
                            questions under instruction from the Chinese Government. I then repeated
                            the statements which I had previously made, as set forth above.</p>

                        <p>The Chinese Ambassador called to say goodbye. He pointed out that China
                            was appealing for League assistance against Japan under Article 17 of
                            the Covenant, and added that he had received instructions to try and
                            persuade the American Government either through approaching the British
                            and French Council Delegates at Geneva, or the British and French
                            Foreign Offices to support the Chinese position <pb n="513"
                                xml:id="pg_513" facs="0517"/>at the League. I told the Ambassador
                            that while I would, of course, report his request to my superiors
                            nonetheless I saw little chance of its being favorably acted on as we
                            were not members of the League and had always made it a point carefully
                            to refrain from advocating any procedure on a member of the League under
                            the Constitution of that body. He asked if Mr. Harrison were not sitting
                            with the Council as observer. I told him no, that he was in Geneva, that
                            he was a member of the Committee of twenty-eight, that his Deputy was a
                            member of the Committee on Technical Aid to China but that he did not
                            sit with the Council in any way except on one occasion when he would
                            meet with them to cast his vote on the composition of the Permanent
                            Opium Board.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he was also going to mention his plea to other
                            officials in the Department but had brought it up with me also as the
                            League of Nations fell within the purview of the Division of European
                            Affairs.</p>

                        <p>The Chinese Ambassador called and said that he had come to say goodbye.
                            Mr. Hornbeck expressed regret that the Ambassador was leaving.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador brought up—as he had brought up with Mr. Moffat and Mr.
                            Hamilton—the subject of China’s appeal to the League under Article 17.
                            He expressed the hope that the American Government would volunteer to
                            the League a suggestion that the League act vigorously, with an
                            indication that the United States would give such action support (by
                            concurrent or parallel action). Mr. Hornbeck referred to the tremendous
                            preoccupation of the leading powers members of the League with the
                            European situation and to the embarrassments of those among them that
                            are most friendly to China.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then suggested that the United States might ask for a
                            reconvening of the Brussels Conference under the Nine Power Treaty. Mr.
                            Hornbeck asked whether the Ambassador had considered the probabilities
                            with regard to the responses that would be made by the various powers,
                            especially the more important of them, to an inquiry or invitation
                            toward that end; also, whether any advantage would accrue either to the
                            cause of peace in general or to <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0518"
                            />the cause of China in particular through the making by the American
                            Government of such a gesture, with the probable immediate consequences
                            thereof. The Ambassador indicated that consideration of those questions
                            would lead to a not very optimistic conclusion.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then made some pleasant observations on the subject of his
                            sojourn in Washington as Ambassador. Mr. Hornbeck inquired whether the
                            Ambassador would go, in China, to Chungking. The Ambassador replied in
                            the affirmative.</p>
                        <p>With exchanges of appropriate amenities the conversation was brought to a
                            close.</p>

                            presents a new legal situation; (2) it will refer to the resolution

                        <p>245. I am reliably informed that in a secret meeting of the Council this

                            September 27, 5 p.m., was opposed by Belgium and Sweden on the ground
                            that it was inconsistent with their declared policies respecting article
                            16. The resolution has again been referred to a <pb n="515"

                        <p>259. Your 459, September 22, noon. The Counselor of the Chinese Embassy
                            called at the Department on September 22 at the request of Ambassador
                            Wang. He inquired whether the Government of the United States was
                            willing to support the action of the League of Nations in invoking
                            Article 17 of the Covenant and whether this Government would be prepared
                            to act along parallel lines with League members to impose sanctions with
                            the object of restraining aggressor nations and maintaining world peace.
                            The Counselor was informed <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0520"/>that
                            our general attitude and policy with regard to matters concerning action
                            by the League had been made clear to the Ambassador and to the Chinese
                            Government and therefore require no elaboration now. His attention was
                            invited to the fact that questions relating to Article 17 of the
                            Covenant call for consideration by the League, of which the, American
                            Government is not a member, and (with a view to indicating that until
                            the League may have decided on its course of action there exists only a
                            hypothetical basis for the questions which the Counselor had asked) to
                            the further fact that the only action thus far taken by the League had
                            been to address an invitation to Japan pursuant to Article 17.</p>
                        <p>On September 23 Ambassador Wang informed an officer of the Department
                            that the Chinese Government hoped that the League members would take
                            action, in accordance with the Covenant, helpful to China and believed
                            that a confidential approach from the American Government to the British
                            and French Governments in regard to the matter would prove helpful.</p>

                                878.</note> declaring that in view of Japan’s refusal of the
                            invitation extended under article 17 and of the fact that the Assembly
                            had already found Japanese military operations in China to to “illicit”,
                            article 16 is applicable. The report states that League members are
                            entitled not only to act as before on the basis of the Assembly’s
                            previous findings but are also now entitled to adopt individually the
                            measures provided for in article 16. It declares, however, that the
                            coordination of the measures that have been or may be taken can not yet
                            be considered. Sweden, Belgium, and Latvia voted for the report but with
                            reservations referring to their previous statements regarding
                            application of article 16.</p>

                            the declaration that article 16 was applicable marked a step forward. He
                            reserved the right to ask at a later date that the Council take steps to
                            coordinate action of states in carrying out <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518"
                                facs="0522"/>provisions of the article and accepted the report
                            subject to the understanding that the Council remained seized of the

                            resolution providing for investigation of Chinese charges of use of
                            poison gas by Japanese without change in text already reported. British
                            stated that this was best method of inquiry at least in first instance
                            and China in accepting resolution reserved the right to ask Council to
                            take further action if present procedure proved to be ineffective.

                        <p>Dr. Chen called at his request. He was accompanied by Mr. Tsui. Dr. Chen
                            said that the Chinese Embassy had received instructions from the Chinese
                            Ministry of Foreign Affairs directing the Embassy to approach the
                            Department in regard to the forthcoming meeting of the Council of the
                            League of Nations on January 16, to state that the Sino-Japanese
                            conflict would come up for consideration again at this meeting of the
                            League Council, to point out that the Chinese Government realized that
                            the United States was not a member of the League but that in the opinion
                            of the Chinese Government the governments members of the League Council
                            naturally looked to the United States for an indication of attitude in
                            regard to a matter of this character, and to express the hope of the
                            Chinese Government that this Government would by such means and in such
                            way as might be practicable and appropriate take steps, either directly
                            or indirectly, toward causing the governments represented on the <pb

                            definite action than had hitherto been taken in the way of assisting
                            China and of checkmating Japan.</p>
                        <p>I referred to the fact that Mr. Tsui had been in to see me a number of
                            months ago on this same subject.<note n="69" xml:id="d529fn69">See

                            United States was not a member of the League. I said also that the
                            attitude of this Government and the principles of policy in which this
                            Government believes had been made clear to the American people and to
                            the world in the published statements and addresses of the Secretary of
                            State and of the President. I said that I would of course make record of
                            Dr. Chen’s approach under instruction from his Government and refer the
                            matter to higher officers of the Department.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Chen, in closing the interview, said that his Government wished to
                            lay this matter before us and that he realized that decision as to
                            whether any action by this Government along the line indicated was
                            practicable and appropriate, and, if so, in what way this Government
                            would bring its influence to bear, was a matter for decision by this
                            Government.</p>

                        <p>The Chinese Ambassador came in upon his own request. I first inquired
                            about the general situation in China. He seemed not to have any
                            particular information, more than what I already had. He then said that
                            Chiang Kai-shek<note n="70" xml:id="d530fn70">As President of the
                                Chinese Executive Yuan (Premier).</note> is relinquishing his
                            position as head of the civil department of the Government in order to
                            give his entire attention to military operations, and is placing Dr. H.
                            H. Kung<note n="71" xml:id="d530fn71">Chinese Minister of
                                Finance.</note> in charge of the civil affairs of the Chinese
                            Government. The Ambassador next offered his personal view that Chiang
                            Kai-shek should have taken this step six months ago.</p>
                        <p>I inquired as to when, in the opinion of the Ambassador, the Chinese
                            Government would feel obliged to move from Hankow to Chungking. He
                            replied that he did not think they would move from Hankow at all soon;
                            that they would not move until and unless the <pb n="520"
                                xml:id="pg_520" facs="0524"/>capture of Hankow was more or less
                            imminent. I then asked as to what the Japanese situation with respect to
                            Hankow seemed to be. He said that the Japanese had not advanced farther
                            in that direction than to a point not far above Wuhu and was showing no
                            disposition at present to move ahead. I inquired whether he had any late
                            information about conditions in Nanking, and he said that he did
                            not.</p>
                        <p>I then inquired whether his Government is getting any supplies through
                            French Indo-China, and he said he understood that a certain amount is
                            being gotten across by making detours. I was not much impressed with the
                            earnestness of this statement. I inquired what would be done with the
                            locomotive being shipped from this country this week, and he replied
                            that it would be shipped to Hong Kong; that it could not go across the
                            narrow-gauge road in French Indo-China.</p>
                        <p>I inquired if the Ambassador knew what the Russian state of mind is with
                            respect to the Chinese-Japanese situation. He said he had nothing new
                            upon that subject. Another inquiry was whether in his judgment the
                            internal troubles in Russia are creating a feeling on the part of all
                            other nations that Russia would be correspondingly engrossed without any
                            definite program relating to international foreign policy, especially in
                            the Far East. To this he readily agreed.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then brought up the question he had in mind in coming to
                            the Department today, and he proceeded to say that at the Brussels
                            Conference some weeks ago<note n="72" xml:id="d530fn72">See <ref

                            the representatives of Britain, France, and the United States, the
                            necessity for a loan from these three governments for China, of five
                            hundred million dollars with which to purchase munitions, arms, and
                            implements of war, and that the impression was left with Dr. Koo that
                            the matter would be given further attention by this Government and
                            presumably a more definite answer made than Mr. Norman Davis<note n="74"
                                xml:id="d530fn74">American delegate.</note> had given in Brussels.
                            Before making reply to the Ambassador’s question, I inquired as to the
                            amount and location of the gold and silver reserves of China. He was
                            vague as to the amount. He said they had certain amounts in certain
                            cities in China, also in London, in Hong Kong, and in the United States.
                            I inquired then as to how long the Chinese Government could go forward
                            on its own resources, incidentally citing the fact that it had proceeded
                            already for six months. The Ambassador replied that it could probably go
                            on another six months on its own resources, and he then proceeded to
                            emphasize the view that it was important and <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521"
                                facs="0525"/>necessary that the Government should look ahead and
                            plan accordingly; hence the desirability and urgency to ascertain about
                            the possibilities of the requested loan of five hundred million dollars.
                            In that connection, I remarked that of course the Ambassador was
                            thoroughly familiar with the fact that our entire market for arms,
                            ammunition, and implements of war, is open in this country; that
                            transportation is easily possible; that we are carrying forward our
                            silver purchases from China; that the Export-Import Bank is discounting
                            certain commercial paper for locomotives, etc. The Ambassador agreed
                            with expressions of appreciation on behalf of his Government.</p>
                        <p>I then recurred to his inquiry, and said I was sure that he recalled the
                            conversation which took place at Brussels, to the effect that Mr. Norman
                            Davis had stated that only Congress could authorize a loan in any amount
                            by the Government of the United States, while the British then or
                            thereafter indicated that they were completely preoccupied at the time
                            in producing armament supplies for themselves. I then said that there
                            had been no developments with respect to this matter since the Brussels
                            conversations; that I could not undertake to speak for Congress in
                            regard to possible legislation authorizing a loan; that, in the
                            circumstances, I would not be frank, as I always desired to be, if I
                            offered any comment as to the situation beyond what was said at
                            Brussels, except that this is a matter which comes under the authority
                            and jurisdiction of Congress. The Ambassador indicated he understood
                            this view, and then suggested that perhaps the President and the
                            executive branch might have influence with Congress in carrying out a
                            program such as he was proposing. I replied that in some and possibly
                            many instances this would be true, but that the Congress itself is
                            giving increasing attention to our foreign affairs and especially to
                            conditions in the Pacific area, and that it would have definite opinions
                            in regard to the question of a loan and hence would not be susceptible
                            of influence by the opinions of the executive or other branches of the
                            Government; that in any event I could not and would not, in justice to
                            all concerned, undertake to comment as to the future in this connection
                            but only stand on what has been said to the effect that the Congress
                            alone has jurisdiction and must be looked to for the necessary
                            legislation. The Ambassador sought to induce me to say that the matter
                            was still under advisement and that there were possibilities of a
                            different decision in the future. To this I again promptly brought him
                            back to my statements which I have just recorded and I made the matter
                            most definite by a further statement that I was not called upon to speak
                            except as to the present; that I had spoken definitely as to the
                            present; and that the future would have to take care of itself. The
                            Ambassador did not seem at all surprised.</p>
                        <pb n="522" xml:id="pg_522" facs="0526"/>
                        <p>With reference to the report of the Japanese Government’s peace terms to
                            the Chinese Government, I remarked that, having been confined at my
                            apartment with a severe cold for some days, I had not seen and conferred
                            with the President in the meantime; that I was informed the Chinese
                            Ambassador had had a conference with the President and, in order that
                            there might be no crossing of wires, I might inquire whether the Chinese
                            Ambassador had discussed the Japanese peace proposals in the presence of
                            the President; if so, whether the President had offered any comment
                            whatever relative to the merits of the reported peace proposals. The
                            Ambassador replied without hesitation or equivocation that the peace
                            proposals were brought up in his talk with the President, but that the
                            President said not one word touching the merits or demerits of the peace
                            proposals. I did not say to the Chinese Ambassador that my inquiry was
                            due to the fact that a despatch from Johnson in China, repeating a
                            report that had reached him, was to the effect that the President had in
                            fact commented on the merits of the peace proposals and had indicated

                            yesterday he told the British Foreign Office that an agreement had been
                            signed in Washington for a loan of 150 million dollars, but that he

                        <p>Owing to the absence in New York of the Chinese Ambassador, I asked the
                            Counselor of the Embassy to come to see me this morning. I told Dr. Ing
                            that on January 5 the British Ambassador in Washington had advised me
                            that he had just received a cable from Mr. Eden informing him of a
                            conversation which Mr. Eden had had on January 3 with the Chinese
                            Ambassador in London. The latter had stated that the Chinese Government
                            was negotiating with the United States Government for a loan of 125
                            million dollars for ten years at 3 per cent to be issued at 90. I told
                            Dr. Ing that on the following day I had been further informed by the
                            British Ambassador that he had been advised by Mr. Eden of a further
                            conversation which the latter had had on January 5 with the Chinese
                            Ambassador in London in which the latter had said that an agreement had
                            been signed in Washington for a loan of 150 million dollars but that the
                            Ambassador could not say definitely whether the United States Government
                            were concerned or not.</p>
                        <p>I told Dr. Ing that after consultation with the Secretary of the
                                Treasury<note n="80" xml:id="d532fn80">Henry Morgenthau, Jr.</note>
                            I had informed the British Ambassador that no conversations, no
                            negotiations, and no agreement for a loan had taken place between the
                            United States and the Chinese Governments. I said to Dr. Ing that
                            undoubtedly some strange misapprehension and misunderstanding had
                            occurred and that since we wanted, of course, to avoid any type of
                            misunderstanding with the Chinese Government, it seemed to me that it
                            would be helpful if the Chinese Embassy here would communicate with the
                            Chinese Ambassador in London and let him know that there was no
                            foundation for the information which <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524"
                                facs="0528"/>he had conveyed to the British Foreign Secretary in so
                            far as the United States Government was concerned.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Ing told me that he would immediately communicate our conversation to
                            the Chinese Ambassador and ask that the latter take the action with
                            regard to his colleague in London which I had suggested.</p>

                            obtaining a loan of 20,000,000 pounds. In particular he has gone into
                            the matter with Leith-Ross<note n="85" xml:id="d535fn85">Sir Frederick

                        <p>Leith-Ross states that he held out no hope to the Chinese of a loan but
                            that he suggested that something might be done in the matter of
                            arranging commercial credits for the mineral produce. At the moment Hong
                            Kong is the point of export and Leith-Ross said that the Japanese might
                            well interfere with such shipments but that it might prove practical to
                            get certain ores out through Burma.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Quo Tai-chi also stated that the Japanese are now counterfeiting
                            Chinese currency in order to bring it into disrepute and thus
                            disorganize Chinese finances.</p>

                        <p>170. Grant Forbes called on me today. He brought a letter from his
                            [uncle] Cameron Forbes.<note n="86" xml:id="d536fn86">Former Ambassador
                                in Japan.</note> I do not know whom he represents but believe that

                            been dominating and moving spirits. Forbes stated that he had been
                            discussing with Kung possibilities of a material credit arrangement
                            which I believe was based on China’s holdings of silver, but that Kung
                            had made conditions so difficult that he thought his principals would
                            not approve. Forbes stated he was awaiting reply to a telegram. He
                            suggested to me that American Government might be well advised to grant
                            Chinese forces aid in the form of munitions. I told Forbes that I saw no
                            chance of <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0530"/>this; that
                            furthermore I had on all occasions attempted to make quite clear to the
                            Chinese that they could not expect any such aid from American
                            sources.</p>

                        <p>The Chinese Ambassador called this afternoon in consequence of an
                            intimation made by Mr. Hamilton<note n="88" xml:id="d537fn88">Maxwell M.
                                Hamilton, Chief of the Division of Far Eastern Affairs.</note> in a
                            conversation with Mr. Leonard Hsu<note n="89" xml:id="d537fn89">Chinese
                                Industrial Commissioner in the United States.</note> this [<hi
                                rend="italic">yesterday</hi>] morning in connection with the
                            question of a possible loan by the Bankers Trust Company to China (see
                            Mr. Hamilton’s memorandum<note n="90" xml:id="d537fn90">Not
                                printed.</note>).</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that, as Mr. Hornbeck knew, he, the Ambassador, was
                            endeavoring to make the most effective use possible of China’s financial
                            resources, especially China’s stock of silver, toward establishing
                            credits and making possible purchasing by the Chinese Government in the
                            United States. He said that he was trying to make each dollar’s worth of
                            China’s silver stock do the work of two dollars. He said that the United
                            States Treasury had been very helpful in its purchasing of silver. He
                            said that he now had under way a negotiation with the Bankers Trust
                            Company for a loan of from $10,000,000 to $25,000,000; this loan to be
                            secured 50 percent by deposit of silver either with the Bankers Trust
                            Company or elsewhere and 50 percent by resources of the Bank of China;
                            the loan was to be for three (?) years and was to bear interest at from
                            3 to 4 percent; the negotiations had reached a point at which, before
                            going further, he wanted to obtain the “blessing of the Department of
                            State.” He said that approach had been made to Mr. Hamilton on the
                            subject and that now he, the Ambassador, would very much like to have
                            the Department’s view.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hornbeck said that such a question involved consideration of a number
                            of factors. He said that the American Government has been pursuing in
                            regard to China and Japan, in the light of the fact that those two
                            countries are engaged in hostilities, and in the light of the further
                            fact that there is on the statute books of the United States a
                            “Neutrality Act,”<note n="91" xml:id="d537fn91">As amended May 1, 1937;
                                50 Stat. 121.</note> a course designed to conform first of all to
                            the desire of the American people that this country shall not become
                            involved <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0531"/>in armed conflict and
                            that, where there is armed conflict, this country shall not encourage or
                            contribute to the prolonging of the conflict. This Government is trying,
                            Mr. Hornbeck said, to maintain and preserve on behalf of this country a
                            position of neutrality. The people of this country are opposed in
                            principle to the furnishing of funds, furnishing of munitions, etc. For
                            good reasons, the President has seen fit not to make proclamation
                            putting into effect provisions of the Neutrality Act; but the
                            Administration is being guided by the spirit of that Act. Markets in
                            this country are open to foreign governments which, engaged in
                            hostilities, seek to raise funds and to make purchases of munitions,
                            etc., but encouragement is not being given by the Government to such
                            transactions. We had reached, before the Japanese-Chinese hostilities
                            began, a point where the Department of State had ceased to pass upon the
                            question of loans abroad. We had become very conservative on the subject
                            of “giving our blessing” to projects contemplating loans abroad.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hornbeck then went on to say that, speaking in all friendliness, he
                            wondered whether the Ambassador had given full consideration to various
                            possible effects, as regarded China’s interest, which might flow from
                            the obtaining by China at this time of loans in this country. He said
                            that, among other things, Japanese agents have been very active toward
                            obtaining loans and credits for Japan; there has been on the part of
                            American financial interests perhaps more of a disposition to be
                            interested in possible Japanese financing than in possible Chinese
                            financing; there have been informal approaches to agencies of the
                            American Government toward ascertaining the attitude of the Government;
                            and, in general, the Government has discouraged rather than encouraged
                            embarkation by American interests upon such projects. If the Chinese
                            Government succeeded in floating a loan or loans in this country, would
                            not persons interested in possible Japanese financing become more active
                            and be likely to be more successful in that field than has hitherto been
                            the case?</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he thought that Japan had already succeeded in
                            getting a good deal of financial assistance, especially credits in this
                            country. He said that he had taken into consideration the possibilities
                            which Mr. Hornbeck had mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hornbeck said that the most conspicuous of the transactions of Japan
                            had been in sale of gold. He wondered why China did not simply sell more
                            silver. He was not overlooking the Ambassador’s statement that he wanted
                            a dollar’s worth of silver to do the work of two dollars; but advantages
                            gained along that line would be advantageous only for a short time: what
                            the Ambassador had in contemplation was a short-term loan, and it is
                            amazing how soon payment on short-term loans becomes due. The Ambassador
                            said that he had <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0532"/>in
                            contemplation other loans which, when and as negotiated, would make
                            possible payments when due.</p>
                        <p>There followed some further discussion of points of which mention is made
                            above; and Mr. Hornbeck finally said that, as the Ambassador would
                            realize from what had been said, the Department was not in position
                            either to give a blessing to or to make an objection to entry by the
                            Bankers Trust Company upon a loan project. The Ambassador asked whether
                            this meant that the Department “did not object.” Mr. Hornbeck said that
                            that was not exactly the meaning: he repeated that the Department was
                            not in position definitely to “make an objection to,” i. e., to
                            veto.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hornbeck then brought up another subject (the matter of Bernhard and
                            Company: record of which is made in a separate memorandum<note n="92"

                        <p>Mr. McComas referred to a project of which the Department already had
                            some information, a project for a loan by the Bankers Trust Company to
                            the Chinese Government. He said that he and Mr. Freyvogel had come to
                            the Department with regard to political aspects of this project. In the
                            course of the conversation he outlined the project as one whereby the
                            bank would loan China $10,000,000; China would deposit silver to the
                            value of $5,000,000 and the Bank of China would deposit securities
                            covering the balance plus perhaps a 20 percent margin; and, the Bank of
                            China would undertake to deposit additional security if and as needed to
                            cover a proper ratio. Mr. McComas said that he assumed that the Chinese
                            wanted this loan “for propaganda purposes.” He later explained this as
                            meaning that the Chinese Government wished to be able to say to their
                            own people, in <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0533"/>connection with
                            financing in China, and also to the world at large, that they were
                            getting assistance from the United States (or from American
                            sources).</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hornbeck said that in his opinion it is impossible to draw a clear
                            line between economic qualities and political qualities in a matter of
                            loans to foreign governments: he therefore wished to ask some questions
                            which would bear on what might be regarded as the economic or commercial
                            side of this project. He asked questions with regard to the proposed
                            security, especially the part to be offered by the Bank of China, and
                            with regard to activities of the Bankers Trust Company and other banks
                            in New York in connection with or in relation to financing of Chinese
                            and of Japanese business, both public and private, and financing of
                            exports from this country to China and Japan. Mr. McComas and Mr.
                            Freyvogel replied with apparent frankness to these questions. It was
                            brought out that the project under consideration, if undertaken, would
                            constitute the first making of an outright loan by American banks to
                            either of the countries involved since the outbreak of the present
                            Chinese-Japanese hostilities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hornbeck inquired whether Mr. Feis would ask questions or make
                            comments. Mr. Feis expressed the view that there could be no advantage
                            or profit to China from a loan of the character described.</p>
                        <p>The point that China was seeking this loan “for propaganda purposes” was
                            again brought up, and the observation was made that the Chinese
                            Ambassador envisaged this loan as an entering wedge or a stepping stone
                            to the making of other and bigger loans.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hornbeck said that the Chinese Ambassador had spoken to him about
                            this project and had described it as involving from $10,000,000 to
                            $25,000,000. Mr. McComas said that $25,000,000 had been mentioned when
                            the Chinese Ambassador first broached the subject and that $10,000,000
                            had been later talked about as a starting point.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hornbeck then asked just what inquiry, if any, Messrs. Freyvogel and
                            McComas would feel disposed to put to the Department. Mr. McComas said
                            that it was because this project, if proceeded with, would have a
                            political aspect arid would involve a question of national policy, the
                            project being different from ordinary commercial financing, that they
                            had come to the Department. He indicated that they wanted to know what
                            would be the Department’s attitude.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hornbeck said that the Chinese Ambassador had made much the same
                            inquiry, soliciting a “blessing” from the Department for the project,
                            and that he had given the Ambassador an account of this Government’s
                            attitude and policy and had told the Ambassador that he would say much
                            the same thing to the representatives of the bank when they called. He
                            then gave an exposition of policy and procedure in the light of the
                            existence of the Neutrality Act and of public opinion <pb n="530"
                                xml:id="pg_530" facs="0534"/>in regard to subjects to which that act
                            relates. He said that the old practice of the Department’s giving
                            consideration to projects for foreign loans and expressing itself in
                            terms of “no objection” or to the contrary has been discontinued. He
                            said that, with the points which he had mentioned in mind, the parties
                            interested in such a possible project would realize that the Department
                            was not prepared to take a position with regard to the matter and, with
                            those same points in mind, each of the parties must decide for
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McComas said that it was clear that the project had substantial
                            political implications, would involve national policy to a considerable
                            extent, and that Mr. Feis and Mr. Hornbeck could understand what would
                            be his and Mr. Freyvogel’s position (which he implied would be
                            unfavorable toward proceeding with the project); he added that he would
                            explain the whole matter to his associates at the bank. Mr. Hornbeck
                            said that he wanted to make sure that it would not be re-ported that the
                            Department had taken a position either pro or contra the project: we
                            could not say that we were favorable to it and we would not say that we
                            were opposed to it. Mr. McComas and Mr. Freyvogel said that this was
                            understood.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that, in the
                            course of a conversation about other i matters, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross
                            reiterated the statement reported in the Embassy’s 236, March 23, 1 p.m.
                            He went on to say that there were now 170,000 coolies working on the
                            Burma-Yunan road which was scheduled to take three and would, in fact,
                            only take five months to complete. This added channel of communication
                            should prove quite helpful to China, which at the moment was receiving
                            most of its munitions from Europe via French Indo-China by road or by
                            rail. Leith-Ross said that Chiang Kai-shek had six months’ supply of
                            munitions and he was now also getting supplies from Russia, including
                            some quite useful tanks. Nevertheless the Chinese, through Dr.
                                Sun-Fo,<note n="94" xml:id="d539fn94">President of the Chinese
                                Legislative Yuan.</note> were pressing hard for money with which to
                            purchase further supplies.</p>
                        <p>Leith-Ross inquired about our purchases of Chinese silver and asked
                            whether our action as regards Mexico would affect the position. He <pb
                                n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0535"/>said that he personally wished
                            the British Government could undertake similar purchases but when it was
                            suggested that the Government of India could do so (paragraph 2,
                            Embassy’s 267, March 30, 7 p.m.<note n="95" xml:id="d539fn95">Not
                                printed.</note>), he said that India already had more silver than it
                            wanted. Leith-Ross explained that the offers which the Chinese had made
                            here as regards silver were on the basis of pledged silver as security,
                            and he therefore wondered whether American arrangements with the Chinese
                            precluded them from selling silver on the market or elsewhere. He did
                            not indicate that the British Government was prepared to buy silver, but
                            he implied that it certainly could not consider entering into
                            transactions on the basis of pledged silver for that would mean a loan,
                            which was out of the question since it would require Parliamentary
                            sanction.</p>
                        <p>Leith-Ross seemed both pleased and encouraged at the resistance the
                            Chinese had offered. He also said that in his opinion they had done a
                            commendable job as regards their currency: it had been held a very long
                            time under trying conditions, and was only now slipping. He expressed
                            the hope that the foreign banks would take some risks and help the
                            Chinese by not attempting to cover themselves against every contingency.
                            For instance, small transactions now affected the exchange rate and,
                            therefore, it would be well if the foreign banks would carry small
                            foreign exchange transactions between allotments.</p>

                                adviser to the Chinese Ministry of Finance.</note> inquires whether
                            Department is in position to express any views for his guidance as to
                            attitude of American Government in case China should decide to curtail
                            unessential imports in order to safeguard currency and economic
                            situation and strengthen war effort. He considers it would be much
                            preferable to utilize prohibitions in so far as properly applicable and
                            to limit use of restrictive or prohibitive tariffs because (first)
                            prohibitions less likely to become permanent trade barriers and (second)
                            danger that tariffs would cause marking up internal prices and tend to
                            initiate general price rise which so far has not gone far but might
                            develop due to general conditions <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532"

                            American Government would not feel obliged to object on treaty or other
                            grounds to imposition of certain temporary prohibitions if deemed
                            necessary since acquiescence would be concrete manifestation of sympathy
                            with China.</p>
                        <p>I may add that I feel that something of this kind is inevitable; that the
                            suggested action seems least harmful of possible actions that might be
                            taken. I hope that United States can take a sympathetic attitude under
                            serious situation now facing Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>Young says that he does not know that above steps will be taken. He has
                            told no one of this inquiry.</p>

                        <p>389. Under the title “Rumored Large American Loan to China” the editorial
                            in this morning’s <hi rend="italic">Asahi</hi> is given to a discussion
                            of the American attitude toward the current conflict. Information from
                            Hong Kong and Shanghai, it states, reports American loans of 25 million
                            on the security of silver deposited with the United States and of 500
                            million dollars on the security of banking rights, mining, and other
                            collateral. The editorial finds it not unlikely that Chinese
                            negotiations for loans in the United States have made some progress even
                            if these details are inaccurate. It asserts that a business basis for
                            such loans is lacking and that they are possible only as political loans
                            made by the American Government. Discussing the probabilities in
                            accuracy of the report, it deduces that probably the report arises from
                            a new silver purchase agreement. The editorial thereupon <pb n="533"
                                xml:id="pg_533" facs="0537"/>goes into the American policy of
                            purchasing Chinese silver, states that the American policy is keeping
                            Chinese currency up in spite of lack of foreign trade, and asserts that
                            the Chiang Kai Shek régime is thereby being sustained. Recent
                            intensification of American opinion against Japan is admitted.</p>

                                printed.</note> In the course of a conversation, the British
                            Treasury referred to the desirability of making <pb n="534"
                                xml:id="pg_534" facs="0538"/>funds available to China and
                            confidentially described the position here as follows:</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office was strongly in favor of a loan but the Cabinet had
                            not been able to make up its collective mind. The Chancellor of the
                                Exchequer<note n="99" xml:id="d544fn99">Sir John Simon.</note> was
                            not in favor of taking any action which would offend the Japanese and
                            yet would not have important benefits for China. Simon, therefore,
                            recommended the making either of a substantial loan or none at all. But
                            any large sum would have to have a British Government guarantee and
                            there lay the stumbling block.</p>
                        <p>The British Treasury felt that not less than £10,000,000 and preferably
                            £20,000,000 would constitute a sum sufficient to facilitate food and
                            other purchases and strengthen the Chinese exchange position.</p>
                        <p>The British Treasury did not conceal its chagrin at the delay in facing
                            up to this situation and took the line that until the British Cabinet
                            made up its mind it could not appropriately approach the United States
                            regarding joint action.</p>
                        <p>Asked about the reaction in Japan to any such project, the British
                            Treasury stated that it would no doubt be hard to explain but since the
                            Japanese had always maintained that they favored the bringing of
                            stability to China’s exchange, it might be defended on that score though
                            the defence would certainly be weak and transparent.</p>
                        <p>The British Treasury mentioned that Russia had accorded China some
                            £8,000,000 of barter credits.</p>

                        <p>1077. I discussed with Bonnet<note n="1" xml:id="d545fn1">Henri Bonnet,
                                French Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> last night the action of
                            the French Government in landing troops on the Paracel Islands and the
                            action restricting Japanese exports to France (reported in my 1040, July
                            1, 3 p.m.<note n="2" xml:id="d545fn2">Not printed.</note>). Bonnet said
                            that these two actions did not indicate any change in French policy
                            vis-à-vis Japan and that they were not in any way related. The action
                            with regard to Japanese exports was due solely to the refusal of the
                            Japanese to permit French exporters to get their money out of Japan.</p>
                        <p>Bonnet went on to discuss the situation in China and said that he
                            believed that Chinese resistance could and would continue indefinitely
                                <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0539"/>provided China could obtain
                            a loan for the purpose of maintaining Chinese currency in foreign
                            exchange markets. Incidentally the same statement has been made to me by
                            a number of competent observers who have recently come to Paris direct
                            from China.</p>
                        <p>Bonnet added that he was now satisfied the British were doing everything
                            they could to support Chiang Kai Shek. He said that he was certain that
                            both Great Britain and France would be prepared to advance money to the
                            Chinese Government at the present time if the United States should be
                            able to take similar action. I gathered that he did not envisage a joint
                            loan but that he felt both England and France would grant loans to the
                            Chinese Government if it should be possible for our Export Import Bank
                            or some other agency public or private to grant a loan. The action of
                            the three Governments would be separate but simultaneous.</p>
                        <p>I am not sufficiently in touch with our present policies vis-à-vis the
                            Far East to know whether this idea is in the realm of practical
                            politics. Recently I have been impressed, however, by the statements of
                            men returning from China to the effect that Chinese resistance may
                            collapse because of this monetary difficulty and that a sum of 100
                            million dollars would be sufficient to enable the Chinese Government to
                            continue resistance.</p>

                        <p>623. Embassy’s 551, June 23, 6 p.m. I had a conversation with
                                Halifax<note n="3" xml:id="d546fn3">Viscount Halifax, British
                                Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.</note> today at his request.
                            The British are considering a loan up to $100,000,000 to the Chinese for
                            the support of currency. He asked me whether I thought the United States
                            would join in this and I said of course I had no way of knowing what the
                            Government would do. He asked me my personal opinion and I told him I
                            thought it was extremely unlikely.</p>
                        <p>I asked him how he was going to reconcile the position of supporting
                            currency for the Chinese and backing a nonintervention committee in
                                Spain<note n="4" xml:id="d546fn4">For correspondence regarding the
                                Spanish Civil War, see <ref target="frus1938v01#pg_149">vol. <hi
                                        rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, pp. 149</ref> ff.</note> and also
                            advising the Japanese that this loan was only to <pb n="536"
                                xml:id="pg_536" facs="0540"/>help currency and not meant as a
                            hostile gesture to the Japanese. He told me that he did not think the
                            Spanish policy was at all contrary to the policy already set out, on
                            which they were on record as supporting, that everything should be done
                            that could be done to help the Chinese. He said that the Japanese had
                            already approached the British with the idea of joint guardianship of
                            the Chinese financial status, but the British were unwilling to
                            participate.</p>
                        <p>Frankly, however, he is very worried about the Japanese situation and the
                            prospect of a situation arising in Hong Kong which would be another sore
                            spot and might mean trouble—even worse than the present Spanish
                            bombings.</p>
                        <p>I asked him what he had actually called me over there for and he said to
                            get my personal reactions rather than the Government’s reactions. He
                            said that he is in the toughest spot he has been in to advise the
                            Cabinet on this particular question because he is convinced that unless
                            the British do something on currency the Chinese will go bad financially
                            and that the party will be over as far as the Japanese are concerned. If
                            on the other hand the Chinese get some help for their currency they
                            would go along for a year and at that time a better settlement all
                            around could be made.</p>
                        <p>I am sending this on to you for your information because I am convinced
                            that Halifax did me the honor of trying to get my personal reactions on
                            the problem rather than as Ambassador, but if there is anything further
                            you want me to do on it, please advise.</p>
                        <p>Halifax is of the opinion that things have eased up over here
                            considerably but, as I went out the door, he said “I feel that I am such
                            a bad prophet that anything can happen any time and show up the British.
                            I know nothing about what is going on”.</p>

                        <p>350. Your 623, July 11, 8 p.m., especially penultimate paragraph. I
                            believe that it would be useful for you, when next you see Halifax, to
                            take occasion to say to him that your Government has indicated to you
                            that it finds interesting the information that the British are
                            considering a loan to the Chinese for support of currency and welcomes
                            this indication of the line along which the British Government’s thought
                            is proceeding. You should state that your Government feels that
                            assistance of various legitimate types to China at this time should <pb
                                n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0541"/>serve the best interests of the
                            world and that much is being done in this country, some of it with
                            publicity and some without, that is deliberately calculated to be of
                            assistance to China directly or indirectly or both, and that broadening
                            and intensification of such activities are in prospect. Say further,
                            that we believe that a currency loan would be helpful to the Chinese;
                            but we also feel that the making of such a loan jointly or collectively
                            would tend to accentuate adverse Japanese susceptibilities and retard
                            progress toward resolving the fundamental issue inherent in the
                            Chinese-Japanese conflict; that we feel that the problem of assistance
                            can best be dealt with by each country in accordance with its capacity
                            and in its own way, without the disturbing implications of and the
                            delaying complications inherent in joint action; that, moreover,
                            numerous difficulties would attend the floating privately in this
                            country of such a loan at this time and the Government is not in a
                            position to make or to participate in the making of a loan by official
                            action. We are giving and will give assistance along different lines.
                            Some of these will not be conspicuous and will in large measure escape
                            publicity. Well known, however, is the assistance which this Government
                            has afforded to the purchasing in an otherwise unsupported market, of
                            Chinese silver, a type of assistance which in all probability will
                            continue. Substantial assistance has been and probably will be given
                            through the agency of the Export Import Bank. Also, considerable amounts
                            of money have been and are being given by private organizations for
                            relief, medical work, and associated activities for relieving the
                            suffering of Chinese civilian population. We are confident that within
                            the limitations of our policy of non-interference and non-intervention
                            the assistance which has been and which may be rendered by this country
                            will in the long aggregate prove to be of very substantial value to the
                            Chinese. We thoroughly believe that assistance by each country in its
                            own way, without fact or appearance of joint action and with a minimum
                            of publicity, will be most potentially efficacious towards the desired
                            end of peace with stability. Please emphasize especially the point that
                            assistance of that type and along those lines is being given and more of
                            such is in prospect by and in this country.</p>
                        <p>You might in your discretion add, with special reference to Halifax’s
                            apprehension regarding Hong Kong and regarding possible collapse of
                            Chinese resistance, that in our estimates we consider not likely a
                            Japanese attack upon Hong Kong while vigorous Chinese resistance
                            continues and we see little reason now to expect or apprehend a collapse
                            in the near future of Chinese resistance.</p>

                            should the Bank consider the proposition to be a sound one from a
                            business point of view, we do not wish to interpose objection.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson said that he had talked as late as yesterday with a
                            representative of the Chrysler Corporation and had given no intimation
                            that the Bank might be in a position to give assistance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hornbeck said that there has been developing an increasing feeling
                            that, from the point of view of the general interests of the United
                            States, it would be undesirable that China be defeated by Japan, and,
                            hence, a tendency to feel that effort should be made toward giving China
                            assistance when, where and as legitimate methods <pb n="539"
                                xml:id="pg_539" facs="0543"/>may be available. Mr. Pierson said that
                            he had long since had that view. Mr. Hornbeck said that in some quarters
                            the question of “neutrality” is raised, but that, in his opinion, our
                            whole course thus far in relation to the Chinese-Japanese hostilities
                            has been based on the theory that, “war” not having been declared and
                            the “Neutrality Act” not having been put into operation, there exists no
                            question of neutrals and belligerents and we are entitled to carry on
                            with “business as usual” under limitations of political expediency and
                            appropriateness rather than limitations which would apply in
                            international law if we admitted or affirmed that the Chinese-Japanese
                            hostilities constitute “war”. Mr. Pierson made the comment that on the
                            whole the course thus far has been guided and shaped by the fact that no
                            country has declared, affirmed or admitted that these hostilities
                            constitute “war”. He thought that we should plan our course with a view
                            to our future security.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Pierson and Mr. Hornbeck were both of the opinion that it would be
                            lawful and legitimate and would serve a useful purpose for the Bank to
                            facilitate sale of trucks, etc.; also, of the opinion that sale and
                            purchase in not too large lots would be the most practicable way of
                            going about the matter.</p>
                        <p>2. Mr. Pierson said that the Chinese Ambassador had come to him recently
                            with an approach on the subject of wheat and cotton credit: The
                            Ambassador had said that China, due to hostilities, floods, etc., was
                            looking forward to a hard winter and would need food and clothing. Mr.
                            Hornbeck interjected an expression of doubt whether the Chinese
                            Government would want wheat and cotton for purpose of consumption:
                            Whether they did not have in mind selling what they might procure of
                            those commodities toward raising cash with which to purchase arms and
                            munitions. Mr. Pierson said that this possibility had also occurred to
                            him. He continued, however, to the effect that he had replied to the
                            Ambassador that we could hardly consider the question of the wheat and
                            cotton but we might give consideration to a question of flour and
                            cloth.</p>
                        <p>There followed some discussion, in the course of which Mr. Pierson raised
                            the question whether the old wheat and cotton credit ($50,000,000, of
                            which $17,000,000 were used) might not be revised: By that procedure it
                            might be possible to avoid certain types of adverse criticism and to
                            simplify the consideration which would need to be given to the question
                            of security. Mr. Hornbeck said that it had been his understanding that
                            the old credit transaction had been completely closed. Mr. Pierson said
                            that such had been the understanding,—but he seemed to think that it
                            might be possible to re-open.—There followed some discussion of the
                            point that, if we wish to help China in pursuance of a political
                            objective of our own, the balance between <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540"
                                facs="0544"/>the political and the economic aspects of whatever
                            financial transaction with China may be under consideration must
                            necessarily shift somewhat, with primary emphasis on the political
                            rather than on the economic aspects (objectives and methods) of the
                            matter.</p>

                        <p>640. Hansard text of parliamentary announcement made by the Chancellor of
                            the Exchequer yesterday afternoon in answer to an arranged question is
                            as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Various proposals have been made by the Chinese Government for
                                    obtaining a loan in this country. As stated in the reply given
                                    to the honorable member on 14th April last, if in present
                                    circumstances the Chinese Government found it possible to obtain
                                    a loan from British financial institution, any request for
                                    government approval would be sympathetically considered. His
                                    Majesty’s Government have no power themselves to grant or
                                    guarantee a loan without special legislation which in present
                                    circumstances they have not seen their way to introduce.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>In answer to extemporaneous questions Sir John Simon indicated that in
                            reaching this decision British interests had been fully considered and
                            also the terms of the League of Nations resolutions “have been kept very
                            fully in mind.”</p>
                        <p>Asked whether he did not feel that “in view of all that has happened in
                            the Far East the claim of China to assistance in the form of a loan is
                            at least as great as that of Turkey”, the Chancellor of the Exchequer
                            replied: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The circumstances of each case of course have to be weighed and
                                    the circumstances of the present case are very grave and serious
                                    but there is the consideration which must not be overlooked that
                                    in the case of Turkey we were dealing with a loan to a country
                                    which is not engaged in hostilities.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I understand that the decision embodied in the above statement was made
                            by the Cabinet on Wednesday. An official of the British Treasury implied
                            that the Cabinet had been impressed by the desirability of avoiding
                            antagonizing Japan gravely unless Great Britain was in a position to
                            defend its Far Eastern interests without jeopardizing those in Europe
                            and in the Mediterranean.</p>

                        <p>1166. The Chinese Ambassador Wellington Koo called on Secretary
                                Morgenthau<note n="10" xml:id="d551fn10">The Secretary of the
                                Treasury was on a visit to Europe.</note> this morning. In the
                            course of the conversation which ensued at which I was present the
                            Chinese Ambassador stated that although the morale of the Chinese Army
                            and the civilian population was admirable the financial resources of
                            China were becoming exhausted. It therefore was a matter of vital
                            importance to the Chinese Government to obtain financial aid.</p>
                        <p>The negotiations for a loan in England had collapsed. The French had
                            indicated their willingness to give a loan or credit provided Great
                            Britain and the United States should give a loan or credit.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of the Treasury stated to the Chinese Ambassador that while
                            he could make no promises of any sort he felt that it might be advisable
                            for the Chinese Government to send Mr. K. P. Chen,<note n="11"
                                xml:id="d551fn11">Chairman of the Foreign Trade Commission, Chinese
                                Ministry of Finance.</note> with whom he had negotiated in the past
                            with pleasure, to the United States for the purpose of inquiring into
                            the possibilities of obtaining a credit for the purchase of flour and
                            grain goods.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of the Treasury suggested also that if Mr. K. P. Chen
                            should come to the United States he should inquire into the methods of
                            purchasing now employed by the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Ambassador was most grateful for these suggestions and said
                            that he would communicate with his Government immediately.</p>

                                value, and as to which it was by no means certain that, if it were
                                granted, it would achieve the objects which were intended. The fact
                                that we have not been able to grant or guarantee a loan to China
                                does not exclude all forms of assistance, financial or otherwise,
                                and there are various proposals which have come to us from China for
                                assistance in another way, which are not open to the objections at
                                any rate which we found to a loan, and which are now under
                                examination by the Government Departments concerned.”</p>

                        <p>An inquiry of the British Treasury elicited the fact that the Prime
                            Minister’s speech had been written particularly with an eye to the
                            Opposition’s criticism of his policy, and that the “various proposals”
                            which are “now under consideration by the Government Departments
                            concerned” have only to do with the Export Credits Guarantee Department,
                            (Embassy’s 652, July 19, 6 p.m.<note n="13" xml:id="d552fn13">Not

                        <p>Incidentally, in the course of a conversation between Sir Frederick
                            Leith-Ross, Economic Adviser to the British Government, and Dr. Herbert
                            Feis, Adviser on International Economic Affairs, the former indicated
                            that he had pushed for a British Government guaranteed loan and he
                            seemed definitely of the opinion that action of this type was for the
                            moment settled. This particular conversation did not touch upon the
                            possibility of more indirect measures of assistance. But Sir Frederick
                            Leith-Ross indicated that his initiative was prompted at least as much
                            by the wish to safeguard the Chinese currency against a marked decline,
                            as by the thought of providing funds for military purposes for the
                            Chinese Government and he expressed the considered opinion that if the
                            Chinese currency broke decidedly this would lead to such a withholding
                            of trade bills as to weaken critically the Chinese Government.</p>

                        <p>The Chinese Ambassador came in on his own request. He referred to the
                            loan arrangement between this Government and that of China <pb n="543"
                                xml:id="pg_543" facs="0547"/>in 1933, for cotton and wheat in
                            particular, in the amount of 50 million dollars. He said that some 18
                            million dollars of this amount had been consumed by these purchases and
                            the matter left in abeyance as to the balance of the 50 million dollars
                            of purchases. The Ambassador said he desired very earnestly to request
                            that this remaining 32 million dollars of credit be further utilized by
                            purchases from this country of cotton cloth and flour for the urgent
                            relief of nearly 100 million of the Chinese population. He made a plea
                            about the distress in his country and the increasing need for this cloth
                            and foodstuff, adding that this full amount of credit was not utilized
                            on account of good crops in 1935 and 1936. He was very earnest in his
                            representations. I replied that I would look into the matter during the
                            next few days and talk with him further; that this would be the best
                            step to pursue before any formal note from his government should be
                            presented to us on the subject. With this he was in accord.</p>
                        <p>I then inquired of the Ambassador as to when he thought the Japanese
                            would reach Hankow. He replied that it would be some time yet. I
                            inquired as to how long the Chinese would be able to provide themselves
                            with essential military supplies, and he replied that they could go on
                            indefinitely in view of the financial cooperation of this and other
                            countries. He then emphasized that the large Chinese population which
                            came within range of the Japanese invasion would be, however, in urgent
                            need of the cotton cloth and flour for which he was asking.</p>
                        <p>He asked what we knew about the Japanese-Soviet frontier situation.<note

                                to Kung from Washington via Treasury office here stating he had seen

                                the Administration. He quoted both Morgenthau and the latter’s
                                assistant adviser Lockhead as stating that the only chance of China
                                obtaining a loan would be to send K. P. Chen to Washington to
                                negotiate an agricultural commodity loan. He stated that Morgenthau
                                has complete confidence in Chen and said the Secretary feels that
                                because of Chen’s straightforwardness and intimate knowledge of
                                financial problems he could negotiate with him as with no one
                                else.</p>
                            <p>Buck urged that Chen be sent in September to meet the Secretary when
                                he returns from Europe and that Chen be supplied definite
                                information on the need for and use of a commodity loan. He stated
                                that he thought the loan could be as great as China could possibly
                                use in terms of commodities. He added that there also was a good
                                possibility of obtaining credits on Chinese products if same were
                                stored in the United States. Buck will return here August 10 to
                                continue to act as special agent for Treasury.”</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: From a multitude of
                            reliable sources, I have been informed during the past two months that
                            the Chinese will be at the end of their financial resources by the first
                            of next January, unless they can obtain credits abroad. Chiang
                            Kai-shek’s will to fight and the courage of the Chinese people remain
                            unbroken; but there will be just no money to buy anything. I have had
                            this information in a series of messages from Chiang Kai-shek, T. V.
                            Soong, and Doctor Kung transmitted to me by the Chinese Ambassador here,
                            and I have had the same information from a horde of detached
                            observers.</p>
                        <p>As you will recall, some months ago Bonnet said to me that he hoped it
                            might be possible for the United States to extend some sort of a credit
                            or loan to China and that he was certain that if we should be willing to
                            act, both France and Great Britain would act simultaneously though not
                            jointly. Two days ago, Bonnet reiterated this to me. He added that he
                            was certain that either England, France, or the United States could give
                            credits to China without provoking any serious Japanese reaction. The
                            Japanese were too involved in China and were too fearful of Russian
                            attack to dare to act against either England, France, or the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>This reasoning seems to me sound. I believe we should, however, avoid
                            putting ourselves out on any long limb. I do not think we should sell
                            the Chinese arms or munitions on credit, but I believe we should give
                            the Chinese Government a credit of one hundred million <pb n="545"
                                xml:id="pg_545" facs="0549"/>dollars for the purchase of flour and
                            gray goods in the United States.</p>
                        <p>We shall have to take a loss on our wheat and cotton anyhow. If we sell
                            the Chinese Government flour instead of wheat and gray goods instead of
                            cotton, we shall get the benefit of the first processing and even if we
                            should lose the hundred million, it would be money well spent.</p>
                        <p>I have talked over this idea with Henry Morgenthau and find that he is
                            entirely in accord with me. As you know, he suggested to the Chinese
                            Ambassador in Paris that the Chinese Government should send K. P. Chen
                            to Washington and I have just received information that Chen will reach
                            Washington about the same time that Henry returns.</p>
                        <p>If you should approve of this proposal, I suggest that you should let me
                            know in advance so that I could try to push Bonnet into making good his
                            statements to me with regard to the readiness of the French Government
                            to take simultaneous and similar action.</p>
                        <p>I have thought about this a lot and I feel certain that we ought to do
                            it. I hope you will too.</p>
                        <p>Love and good luck.</p>

                            860, July 28, just received, the Department assumes that,
                            notwithstanding the British Government’s decision reported in your 640,
                            July 15, 2 p.m., there may be under consideration proposals which would
                            involve assistance by the Exports Credit Guarantee Department, as
                            indicated in UP press dispatch from London of July 31. The Embassy will
                            of course keep the Department currently and fully informed of any
                            developments in this connection.</p>

                                <p>On August 3, however, he called at his request on the Secretary
                                    and, referring to the cotton and wheat credit of 1933 in the
                                    amount of $50,000,000, said he desired earnestly to request that
                                    the balance of this credit which had not been utilized amounting
                                    to $32,000,000 be now made available for purchases of cotton
                                    cloth and wheat flour for the relief of 100,000,000 of the
                                    Chinese population. The Secretary replied that he would look
                                    into the matter during the next few days and have a further talk
                                    with the Ambassador.</p>
                                <p>While the Department is prepared to explore in this connection
                                    such lines of possible action as appear to be practicable and
                                    appropriate, there are of course various difficulties in the way
                                    of carrying out the Ambassador’s proposal for renewing the
                                    credit arrangement of 1933.</p>
                                <p>As you know, this Government is already affording material
                                    assistance to the Chinese Government through silver purchases in
                                    an otherwise unsupported market. Also, the extension of limited
                                    credits in appropriate cases has been and is being considered by
                                    the Import and Export Bank. Our Ambassador at Paris has been
                                    informed by the Chinese Ambassador there that, pursuant to a
                                    suggestion by the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. K. P. Chen will
                                    shortly proceed to Washington for the purpose of looking into
                                    possibilities of obtaining a credit for the purchase of
                                    agricultural commodities.”</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador of China called at his own instance and inquired what
                            progress I was making in regard to his request some days ago for the
                            further extension of $30,000,000 of credit to his Government for the
                            purchase of flour and cotton cloth. I replied that I had been giving the
                            matter full attention; that the credit situation had assumed a different
                            form from what it once was prior to the exhaustion of 18 million dollars
                            of the original 50 million dollars of credit; and that it presented
                            difficult questions in more than one respect. I said that I had called
                            on my associates to give the matter early and sympathetic attention; and
                            that, of course, I would be glad to acquaint the President with the
                            Ambassador’s visits here and his request. I concluded with the statement
                            that it would be some days before we could reach a conclusion—that we
                            might do so next week. The Ambassador was very urgent in his tone and
                            demeanor.</p>

                        <p>I called on the Chinese Ambassador at his residence. I referred to the
                            approaches made by the Ambassador to the Secretary several days ago at
                            which time the Ambassador had raised the question of a credit of
                            approximately $30,000,000 being extended to the Chinese Government for
                            the purchase of flour and cotton cloth. I referred also to the fact that
                            the Secretary had informed the Ambassador that this question was a very
                            complicated one and involved consideration of many factors, financial,
                            economic and political. I said that at some stage in the process of
                            considering the matter it would probably be appropriate that technical
                            experts of this Government study various phases of the question. I said
                            that in the Far Eastern Division we had been giving thought to the
                            question which the Ambassador had raised and that it seemed to us that
                            our thinking might be clarified if we could obtain from the Ambassador
                            information in regard to certain points.</p>
                        <p>I then asked the Ambassador whether there was contemplated an agreement
                            along the lines of the R. F. C. credit of 1933.<note n="21"
                                xml:id="d559fn21">A press release was issued on June 4, 1933, by the
                                Reconstruction Finance Corp. regarding its extension of a
                                $50,000,000 credit to China for the purchase of U. S. cotton and
                                wheat (893.48/708).</note> The Ambassador replied in the
                            affirmative.</p>
                        <p>I thereupon asked the Ambassador whether it was contemplated that the
                            goods would be used in China and not elsewhere. The Ambassador again
                            replied in the affirmative.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador interposed that he would like to give me a little
                            background in regard to this whole matter. He said that last June when
                            Dr. H. H. Kung was in Washington, Dr. Kung and the Ambassador had talked
                            to Mr. Jones of the R. F. C. and to Mr. Pierson of the Export-Import
                            Bank in regard to the question of China obtaining credits for materials
                            to be used in constructive enterprises in China. The Ambassador
                            continued that before consideration had been given to this proposal, the
                            fighting broke out on July 7 at the Marco Polo bridge; that thereafter
                            the whole matter remained in abeyance, chiefly because of uncertainty as
                            to the question whether this Government would invoke the Neutrality Act;
                            that early in December, when it appeared that it was not likely that the
                            Neutrality Act would be invoked, the Chinese Ambassador furnished the
                            Export-Import Bank with a list of goods desired by the Chinese
                            Government for constructive purposes in China, the total purchase price
                            to aggregate <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0552"/>approximately
                            $50,000,000. The Ambassador said that no affirmative action had been
                            taken by the Export-Import Bank. The Ambassador said that in view of
                            this fact it had occurred to him that it might be more practicable for
                            this Government to extend a credit for relief purposes. He said that
                            although his Government did not, he personally understood the questions
                            presented to this Government by reason of the Neutrality Act. He said
                            that he had therefore presented this question to the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that in his conversation with the Secretary he had
                            mentioned flour and cotton cloth as merely illustrative. He said that
                            his Government would be interested in obtaining on credit raw cotton
                            (which is widely used by the Chinese people for padding of clothes
                            during the winter), wheat, medicines, and perhaps other things. He said
                            that his Government would be interested in purchasing trucks which could
                            be used to transport the relief supplies to the main centers of
                            distribution (and possibly to interior points).</p>
                        <p>In reply to my inquiry as to the purpose to which the Chinese Government
                            would put such goods, he said that such goods would be utilized for the
                            relief of the Chinese people who had been rendered destitute as a result
                            of the hostilities. I inquired whether it was not a fact that most of
                            these destitute people were in areas controlled by the Japanese
                            military. He replied in the negative. He said that Japan controlled only
                            the cities and certain railway lines, and that the people in the country
                            were not under Japanese control. (Comment: It remains the belief of
                            officers of FE that the majority of the people who need relief are in
                            areas not controlled by the Chinese Government.) The Ambassador
                            indicated that the Chinese Government might wish to utilize some of
                            these goods for relief purposes at Shanghai and at Tientsin and in other
                            areas under Japanese control but that the major portion of the
                            commodities would be utilized in territory under the control of the
                            Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>I asked the Chinese Ambassador how his Government would take care of the
                            problem of distribution, and where and by what means would delivery be
                            effected in China. The Ambassador said that even should the Japanese
                            take Hankow, supplies could be sent in through French Indo-China and
                            through Burma. I pointed out that this would probably be expensive and
                            not very rapid. I asked how the supplies would be distributed into the
                            interior. He said that it was his idea that the village magistrates and
                            American missionaries might be utilized. I remarked that there would
                            still remain a very difficult problem of distribution.</p>
                        <p>I asked the Ambassador what quantities of goods the Chinese Government
                            could use. He said that he could not answer that question.</p>
                        <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0553"/>
                        <p>He said that if and when the Secretary was in position to inform him that
                            this Government was favorably disposed in principle, he would wire his
                            Government for details and information as to the amounts and types of
                            goods which the Chinese Government needed for relief purposes.</p>
                        <p>I said to the Ambassador that it was my understanding that the Chinese
                            Government needed at the present time above all else foreign exchange
                            and money with which it could purchase commodities abroad. I said that I
                            did not see how the Ambassador’s proposal would assist China in these
                            respects. The Ambassador agreed that his proposal would not furnish the
                            Chinese Government with foreign exchange. He said, however, that his
                            proposal would relieve the Chinese Government from the necessity of
                            spending sums of money for the relief of destitute Chinese. I remarked
                            to the Ambassador that in a time of national emergency, such as that now
                            confronting China, was it not true that, while the Chinese Government
                            assisted in a modest way in the problem of relief, the destitute people
                            were cared for primarily by their own families and by charitable
                            organizations. The Ambassador maintained that the Chinese Government was
                            expending considerable sums of money on relief.</p>
                        <p>I said to the Ambassador that if cotton goods were furnished, they
                            presumably would take the form of gray goods which normally require
                            further processing. I asked how and where this processing could be done,
                            inasmuch as most of the Chinese mills were in Shanghai and Tientsin. The
                            Ambassador made no definite reply to this question, other than to say
                            that the Chinese Government might like to obtain cotton as well as
                            cotton goods.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador repeated that his proposal represented merely a general
                            idea and that if and when the Secretary was in position to inform the
                            Ambassador that this Government was favorably disposed in principle, the
                            Ambassador would wire his Government for details. The Ambassador said
                            that the matter was urgent inasmuch as winter would soon be confronting
                            the Chinese destitute population and as two or three months would
                            probably be required to work out the details and to effect deliveries in
                            China.</p>
                        <p>As of interest in this general connection, the Acting American Commercial

                            that at most for relief purposes, and not for any commercial purpose,
                            for distribution in Shanghai to refugees his committee could now use
                            only about 6,000 tons spread over one year”. The Acting Commercial
                            Attaché comments further as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“A Chinese Government wheat and flour loan with Shanghai as the
                                    destination would seem now to be out of the question as this is
                                    in Japanese occupied territory, in fact the report above which
                                    states that most of the Chinese mills are now in Japanese
                                    occupied territory is true. If American loan wheat or flour were
                                    to be shipped to Chinese controlled territory at the present
                                    time, transportation problems of a serious nature would enter
                                    in, deliveries would have to be made to South China (which is
                                    not a flour consuming but a rice consuming area) and thence by
                                    inland transportation to distant bread consuming points in the
                                    interior. It is believed too many complications would be
                                    involved under present conditions of transportation and high
                                    costs thereof to warrant the consideration of such a plan at
                                    this time.”</p>

                                <p>“There is enclosed a leaflet issued by the International Red
                                    Cross Committee for Central China on June 1, 1938, being a
                                    survey of the war refugee situation by the Committee’s advisor
                                    on war refugee relief. This report constitutes a sober,
                                    dispassionate survey and is based on replies to questionnaires
                                    sent out by the Red Cross Committee as well as on personal
                                    investigation by the author and other members of the Committee.
                                    It shows that, although the number of persons who have moved as
                                    a result of the war undoubtedly runs into millions, yet the
                                    actual number of refugees in Central China receiving or in need
                                    of help in refugee camps is much less than might be expected.
                                    The reason for this is that many times the number of refugees
                                    being cared for in camps are receiving assistance from their
                                    fellow country-men in ways which are not immediately obvious.
                                    That is to say, large numbers of refugees are being cared for by
                                    their family or by their clan, others by their provincial guild
                                    or by one or other of the many Chinese charitable organizations
                                    such as the Red Swastica Society. The report gives the number of
                                    refugees in camps in Wuhan (Hankow, Wuchang and Hanyang) as
                                    40,000 and states that this is the largest concentration of
                                    refugees in Central China.”</p>
                                <p>“Evidence that there is a great movement amounting almost to a
                                    migration, chiefly westward, of Chinese people is given by
                                    missionaries who come to this office from their stations in
                                    Honan and Hupeh. Many of these refugees have some funds; more
                                    are totally without funds and are dependent on charity along the
                                    road.”</p>

                            saw the Chinese Ambassador and endeavored to obtain further information

                            credits to China for relief purposes.</p>

                            of Secretary Morgenthau, who returns on August 29, and then to discuss
                            various possibilities with him. The question whether Mr. K. P. Chen is
                            or is not coming to the United States may be important in this

                            Export Credit Guarantees Department is not convinced that they will be
                            able to obtain sufficient security and they are not without doubts about
                            the benefit to the Chinese of taking trade out of the hands of
                            individual professionals and canalizing it under the guidance of
                            amateurs. Furthermore the Anglo-Chinese merchant and banking houses are
                            not without influence here and they might well make difficulties.</p>
                        <p>The exact status at the moment is that Kuo is pressing the Export Credit
                            Guarantees Department for a letter to be sent to the Chinese Ambassador
                            in London defining the British terms and the British anticipate “a
                            painful interview” with him tomorrow for they believe that the writing
                            of such a letter would carry with it something of the same objections
                            that led them to reject the proposal for a British Government guaranteed
                            loan and they fully expect that any such letter would be “waved in the
                            face of the Japanese.” Furthermore the British are aware that the
                            Chinese Embassy in Paris has been attempting to work out a proposal
                            along somewhat similar lines without the knowledge of the Chinese
                            Embassy in London. On the other hand the Chinese Embassy in London to
                            mislead their Paris colleagues has indicated that everything has been
                            settled here.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore the Export Credit Guarantees Department itself is having
                            difficulties. It was set up as a nonpolitical commercial body with an
                            advisory committee of businessmen, and now in the face of increasing
                            pressure from the Foreign Office, and to some extent the Treasury, to
                            undertake operations for reasons which are difficult to defend on their
                            commercial merits, it is somewhat hamstrung. Its advisory committee of
                            businessmen naturally do not wish to accept responsibility for losses
                            incurred for political causes; and in any case it cannot by statute give
                            credits for armaments.</p>
                        <p>The Export Credit Guarantees Department states therefore that in the
                            given circumstances no decisive action can be taken about the above in
                            the next few weeks anyway. A Cabinet decision may well prove the
                            propelling factor.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Tentative discussions have been taking place
                            regarding the Marsman proposition (Embassy’s 652, July 19, 6 p.m.<note
                                n="28" xml:id="d561fn28">Not printed.</note>). The Mars-man group
                            claim that their Chinese associates are in a position to obtain funds
                            for the construction of the railway from the Burmese border to Chengtu.
                            They look to the Export Credit Guarantees Department for about pounds
                            2,500,000 worth of rolling stock and equipment <pb n="553"
                                xml:id="pg_553" facs="0557"/>and offer as security a first charge on
                            the revenue for the whole line. The Export Credit Guarantees Department
                            has the same opinions of the Marsman group as reported in the Embassy’s
                            telegram No: 652 and they have been unable to ascertain the Marsman
                            group’s exact status, whether it is acting as co-principal or merely in
                            a consultative capacity. This Department likewise is inclined to the
                            view that this line is a long range peace time project and that whereas
                            it might open up an important trading area and save some 2,000 miles of
                            sea journey, it is difficult to envisage its construction and completion
                            in the present circumstances. The Burmese are represented as not being
                            actively favorable to the proposition, although some observers predict
                            that such a line would turn Rangoon into an important entrepot
                            center.</p>

                        <p>The British Ambassador called at his request. He said that he had called
                            on the Secretary on Saturday last in reference to other matters and that
                            the Secretary had indicated that we were giving thought to the question
                            of the possibility of extending credits to China for the purchase of
                            commodities of a type which could not be used for military purposes. The
                            Ambassador said that he had not discussed with the Secretary this
                            question but that in turning the matter over in his mind he wondered
                            whether he should have pursued the matter further with <pb n="554"
                                xml:id="pg_554" facs="0558"/>the Secretary. He asked whether I could
                            give him any further information in the matter. He said that the Chinese
                            Ambassador at London had informed the British Foreign Office that at the
                            forthcoming meeting of the League Assembly<note n="30" xml:id="d562fn30"
                                >See <ref target="#pg_508">pp. 508</ref> ff.</note> the Chinese
                            would press for definitive action on the subject of the extension of
                            assistance to China. He added that the Chinese Ambassador at London had
                            indicated that some assistance would be forthcoming from the American
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>I said that as the Ambassador was aware the Chinese Ambassadors at
                            London, Paris and Washington had from time to time approached the
                            governments to which they are accredited with various proposals for the
                            extension of loans or credits to the Chinese Government. I said that the
                            most recent such approach to this Government by the Chinese Ambassador
                            here had taken the form of a suggestion that this Government extend
                            credits to China for the purchase of commodities to be utilized for the
                            relief of the many millions of destitute, homeless Chinese. I said that
                            we have been giving the matter thought. I referred to the fact that some
                            weeks ago the British Government had decided adversely in reference to a
                            proposal that the British Government extend a loan to China. I said that
                            it was my understanding that the Export Credit Guarantee Department of
                            the British Government had been and was continuing to give certain
                            consideration to various proposals involving the extension of credit to
                            China for the purchase of certain types of commodities. I said that here
                            we had a somewhat similar situation and that these proposals if and when
                            they were put forward received attention. The Ambassador inquired
                            whether it would be possible under existing legislation for the American
                            Government to extend a credit to China for the purchase of commodities
                            to be used for relief purposes. I said that I thought such action would
                            be possible if the Government should decide that it was advisable to
                            take the action. The Ambassador then remarked that the American
                            Government had previously, in 1933, extended a credit to the Chinese
                            Government. I assented. The Ambassador asked whether I thought a
                            decision would be reached by us in the near future before the meeting of
                            the League Assembly. I expressed doubt whether early action was to be
                            expected and I said that the whole proposition was still just a general
                            idea which was receiving thought but that the matter had not progressed
                            to a point where we had come to grip with practical details. I said that
                            if a decision should be reached to go ahead with the matter, we would
                            probably wish to get in touch with the British Government. I also said
                            that I would report the Ambassador’s call to the Secretary, having
                            especially in mind my statement that if and as our consideration <pb
                                n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0559"/>proceeded to a point where
                            affirmative action on our part appeared likely, we would probably wish
                            to get in touch with the British Government.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Carson called upon me this afternoon. He explained that coordinated
                            approaches were made to the Guaranty Trust Company by the Chinese
                            Ambassador, the Chinese Consul General in New York, and Mr. Hsu in
                            regard to a bank loan of $10,000,000 for three years, secured by a cash
                            deposit of the same amount to be made to the Guaranty Trust Company by
                            the Chinese Government. Mr. Carson stated that since there could be no
                            apparent benefit of a financial character to the Chinese in this
                            transaction, the Guaranty Company was naturally puzzled and would
                            appreciate having any sidelights which the Department may be able to
                            throw on the matter.</p>
                        <p>I stated that as far as official statement went, the Department had “no
                            comment to make”. Mr. Carson asked whether any difficulty would arise
                            under the Johnson Act.<note n="31" xml:id="d563fn31">Approved April 13,
                                1934; 48 Stat 574.</note> I replied that the Department of Justice
                            and not the State Department was the branch of the Government
                            responsible for the interpretation and application of this Act. However,
                            as far as I was acquainted with the Attorney General’s rulings on the
                            subject, China did not fall within the scope of the application of the
                            Act.</p>
                        <p>He said that in the discussion among themselves as to the reasons why the
                            Chinese Government might wish to enter into this transaction, various
                            possibilities presented themselves; among others were the following:
                                (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the Chinese Government thought that
                            through this transaction they might be laying the basis for later and
                            other loan transactions; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the Chinese thought
                            the mere announcement of a loan arrangement would have an encouraging
                            moral effect in China and possibly influence decisions in other monetary
                            centers. I commented that these might be possibilities, and suggested
                            also the transaction might arise from the apparent somewhat competitive
                                <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0560"/>eagerness of the various
                            Chinese diplomatic representatives abroad to secure help for China.</p>
                        <p>In reply to Mr. Carson’s question as to whether previous transactions of
                            this character had come to the attention of the Department, I stated
                            that several had, though differing somewhat in detail; that they had
                            however all dissolved at some point.</p>
                        <p>The discussion also touched upon the question of whether the Chinese
                            Ambassador would have the authority to make the actual deposit of funds,
                            and Mr. Carson said he believed that special credentials would be
                            required.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Carson indicated that he did not think the Guaranty Trust Company
                            would close the transaction because of its difficulty of understanding
                            what purpose may lay behind it.</p>
                        <p>In the course of this conversation, Mr. Hamilton joined us and I
                            summarized the substance of the preceding to him, and he agreed.</p>

                            <p>“Rogers<note n="32" xml:id="d564fn32">Cyril Rogers of the Bank of
                                    England.</note> informs me that Kung intends to have Wellington
                                Koo present a demand at the coming session of the League of Nations
                                on September 9 that China be granted a loan similar to those which
                                have been made to various European countries in the past and to
                                threaten withdrawal if the demand is refused. Informant states that
                                he tried to point out to Kung, first, that there is no present hope
                                of such a loan being granted since London has already rejected the
                                idea and is the dominating influence in the League today, second,
                                that such a plea would only give away China’s present financial
                                crisis to Japan and encourage the Japanese to redouble their efforts
                                in the war just at the time when they are not at all sure of
                                themselves and, third, that the League has served China well in many
                                ways to date and China will have real need of its assistance in the
                                reconstruction work to follow the present conflict. Nevertheless,
                                Kung remains bitter on the question of the failure of western
                                nations to help China and determined to proceed with the idea.</p>
                            <p>Rogers himself then [<hi rend="italic">has?</hi>] recently cabled the
                                British representative at Geneva and suggested that the League
                                forestall China’s action by offering to suspend her annual
                                subscription amounting to 1,400,000 Swiss francs, getting other
                                member states to make up the deficit in the League of Nations budget
                                if necessary. He found an adverse <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557"

                            made looking towards selling China some supplies, such as, flour, cotton

                            from day to day; that it is not without its difficulties; and that a
                            number of departments of the Government are considering all angles of
                            the proposition. The Ambassador expressed his earnest hope that it might
                            be brought to a favorable conclusion before he goes away, and pressed me
                            to give him some intimation about the probable outcome. I said it was

                        <p>Following from McHugh. Financial mission composed of K. P. Chen, T. M.
                            Hsi and two secretaries now scheduled leave by clipper September 9.
                            Morgenthau indicated disapproval of Y. C. Ku and it became necessary to
                            find a substitute. Selection of Hsi who is the general manager of the
                            Central Bank was opposed by Rogers and Soong because of his lack of
                            aggressiveness plus recent loss of grip due to war strain. The untimely
                            death of Sing Loh Hsu who was en route to Chungking for final
                            instructions and who was scheduled to replace Chen left no
                            alternative.</p>
                        <p>General confusion and lack of active appreciation of China’s actual
                            financial crisis have characterized the situation since the invitation
                            first came more than a month ago. Chen’s delay in starting appears to
                            have been due mainly to inability to get clear instructions and full
                            powers from Kung, rather than because of ill-health although he is not
                            well. Rogers has mentioned frequently of late that Kung had no plan or
                            policy for meeting the crisis and demurred even on supplying <pb n="558"
                                xml:id="pg_558" facs="0562"/>Chen with frank statement of present
                            Chinese position plus concrete suggestions for presentation to
                            Morgenthau. He claims that ideas for a possible cash advance by the
                            United States against future deliveries of wood oil, wolfram or other
                            commodities were first suggested to Chen by Nicholson.<note n="33"
                                xml:id="d566fn33">M. R. Nicholson, Treasury Department Attaché in
                                China.</note> He undertook study of them and has since evolved rough
                            plan on wood oil but admits he still lacks complete information. Rogers
                            independently had worked out several such ideas months ago for
                            presentation to London and since arrival here has tried to coach Chen.
                            He states that London rejected all schemes when he was there in June
                            because they anticipated the present crisis in Europe and felt that the
                            slightest move on their part might disturb the delicate balance of
                            relations with Hitler.</p>
                        <p>News of Chen’s trip has in the meantime leaked out in Chinese circles and
                            he has been harassed by visitors who believe that the United States is
                            about to pour money into China and want to share in spoils (there is
                            reason to suspect that the associates of Kung are conniving in this
                            respect [)]. Campbell was approached on September 7 by one C. H. Lee,
                            wealthy mine owner, who admitted close friendship with Kung and former
                            business association with C. T. Wang. He inquired if it would be
                            possible to send a message direct to Morgenthau to offer him a chance to
                            purchase antimony or other minerals direct with no question of loan. He
                            promised to return in a few days with specific proposition. Rogers had
                            mentioned to me that prior to leaving Chungking Kung had proposed
                            instructing K. C. Li to make informal inquiries in Washington as to what
                            Morgenthau might have in mind which former strenuously opposed.</p>
                        <p>Rogers gave me the following figures on Chinese position direct from
                            composite balance sheet of the Central Bank: total sales of foreign
                            exchange in the market since last August equaled pounds sterling 53
                            million; monthly sales have dropped from a peak of over pounds sterling
                            5 million in February to 1.7 in July. He estimated it would be 1.4
                            million for August and thought they could reduce it even further.
                            Reserves have diminished however to about pounds sterling 5 million.
                            Monthly service of foreign loans requires 400,000. Both he and Young
                            assert that the Chinese dollar appears undervalued at its present level
                            and that the relative stability since early in June has been
                            accomplished at comparative small cost. They also state that thus far
                            internal prices have not risen greatly and that the note issue has
                            increased only about 25 percent. [McHugh.]</p>

                        <p>924. In the course of a conversation at the British Treasury today
                            reference was made to the information supplied by the Export Credit
                            Guarantees Department reported in No. 840, August 30, 7 p.m. The British
                            Treasury stated that the situation had not been materially advanced and
                            seemed pessimistic about the possibility of effecting any substantial
                            arrangement for the reason that “the Chinese did not really want British
                            goods but munitions and even if they had any security to offer, the
                            Export Credit Guarantees Department was not by statute able to deal in
                            armaments.”</p>

                        <p>The Chinese Ambassador called on his own request. He said that before
                            taking his leave as Ambassador he was much interested to know what I
                            could tell him further and finally about the question of the relief
                            transactions between our two Governments which are now under discussion.
                            I replied that this Department and other interested departments are
                            giving all phases of the matter steady attention. I then said that the
                            matter could not be further dealt with until the Chinese financiers,
                            who, it was my understanding, are on their way to this country to confer
                            with the Treasury, reach here and such conference is held. The
                            Ambassador seemed fully to understand. He then bade me goodbye.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Suma called by appointment. He said that information which the
                            Japanese Embassy had received from Shanghai was to the effect that the
                            Chinese had recently concluded a loan or some financial arrangement for
                            $20,000,000.00 with the Chase Bank in New York City <pb n="560"
                                xml:id="pg_560" facs="0564"/>and that a group of Chinese bankers was
                            coming to the United States as a financial mission to arrange for
                            credits. Mr. Suma said that it would seem strange to him for such a loan
                            to be made by a New York bank at this juncture and he indicated that he
                            did not take the report seriously. I said that I had seen no recent
                            report of any such loan. I asked whether he referred to the reports in
                            the American papers to the effect that a mysterious group of Chinese had
                            come to this country on a financial mission. He said that he had noticed
                            the reports in the American papers but that quite apart from those
                            reports the Embassy had received from Shanghai the information which he
                            had outlined above. I said that as he was aware there were certain
                            matters with regard to which it was appropriate for this Department to
                            speak; there were other matters with regard to which it was appropriate
                            that the Commerce Department or the Navy Department speak; and that in
                            regard to the reports about this group of Chinese bankers, we commented
                            in response to inquiry that this was a matter for the Treasury
                            Department. I said that I had noticed in the newspapers today statements
                            to the effect that the Secretary of the Treasury had said that he would
                            receive a group of Chinese bankers today. I said that until the Treasury
                            Department wished to give out further information, we had no comment to
                            make. Mr. Suma referred to one newspaper report to the effect that T. V.
                            Soong was a member of the Chinese party. I said that if the press report
                            to the effect that Mr. Morgenthau would receive the Chinese group today
                            was correct, probably the newspapers would carry the names of the
                            members of the Chinese group.</p>

                        <p>995. In view of the report in the Radio Bulletin of a conference between
                            a Chinese financial delegation and the Secretary of the Treasury, I wish
                            to refer to my 924, September 14, 5 p.m., and previous communications
                            regarding the status of Anglo-Chinese discussions for British financial
                            aid to China. At the same time I venture to give you my feeling which is
                            based on nothing tangible that the group of Cabinet Ministers and
                            permanent officials, who threw their weight against the giving of a
                            British guaranteed Government loan in July, is now even more strongly
                            opposed to British intervention. No doubt the critical European
                            situation has strengthened their belief in the Tightness of their
                            previous decision but even before the Czech situation <pb n="561"
                                xml:id="pg_561" facs="0565"/>came to a head Sir Charles Addis,<note

                                China Consortium.</note> for example, who is nothing if not
                            favorably predisposed to the Chinese, in a confidential talk with a
                            British banker emphasized the view that in the long run Great Britain
                            would have to work with and to some extent through the Japanese in
                            fostering its interests in China and he went on to comment on the fact
                            as significant that the Japanese had not broken up the Maritime Customs
                                organization<note n="35" xml:id="d570fn35">For correspondence
                                concerning the Maritime Customs organization, see <ref
                                    target="#pg_626">pp. 626</ref> ff.</note> and that this would
                            eventually furnish an important means through which “we can
                            rebuild”.</p>
                        <p>With the above in view an opportunity was taken to talk with Leith-Ross.
                            He implied that no substantial financial aid for the Chinese was
                            contemplated but he added the proviso that in the event of a European
                            war such assistance would certainly be given. Inasmuch as Leith-Ross had
                            personally advocated the British Government guaranteed loan it may be of
                            interest in connection with the above that he stated that the recent
                            Japanese actions in Tientsin had disillusioned some of those who were
                            hopeful that Japan would ultimately cooperate with other interested
                            powers in China. Leith-Ross went on to say that he understood that
                            whereas the Chinese still had a substantial amount of foreign exchange
                            most of it was earmarked against commitments already entered into.
                            Although there was still a steady trickle of silver coming in from
                            private hoardings his estimate was that the Chinese Government would
                            have very little silver available for sale in the new year. Chinese
                            exports through the south were still holding up comparatively well and
                            the Chinese had been quite competent in obtaining the resulting foreign
                            exchange. But he expressed surprise that the Chinese had continued to
                            service their foreign obligations and did not expect them to do so much
                            longer.</p>
                        <p>Leith-Ross was impressed by the resistance the Chinese had put up over
                            Hankow and was not at all sure whether it would be taken within the
                            Japanese time limit. He estimated Japanese casualties in China thus far
                            at about a quarter of a million, 60% of which were due to disease. Since
                            the recent change of tactics Japanese losses had been increasingly
                            heavy, nevertheless there were this week new indications that they might
                            extend their operations to the south. He estimated this would require a
                            further 200,000 troops and such a move might be “in China’s ultimate
                            interest” and he reiterated his belief that in the long run the Japanese
                            would not be victorious.</p>
                        <p>He said that he understood that some of the Chinese Government’s
                            financial advisers feared that the internal financial situation might
                            reach a point which would cause the Chinese to lose faith in their
                            currency and banking system which would in turn cause a loss of faith in
                            the authority of the present Chinese forces. This might make <pb n="562"
                                xml:id="pg_562" facs="0566"/>them willing to work under puppet
                            Government control. However, the British Embassy in China did not agree
                            with this view; they felt that Chinese nationalism was sufficiently
                            aroused so that the average Chinese would stick by his currency almost
                            regardless of its backing and continue to oppose Japan. Leith-Ross felt
                            that on this question the situation turned and he indicated that he had
                            pointed out to the Japanese here the unwisdom of their taking steps to
                            undermine the Chinese currency; that if they brought chaos to China they
                            in turn would suffer as well. In this connection the head of the
                            Yokohama Specie Bank in London had called to see Leith-Ross and made
                            strong protestations to the effect that Japanese commercial and
                            financial interests and in particular his bank were strongly opposed to
                            any action which would seriously undermine the Chinese dollar and he
                            went on to inveigh in the usual manner against the Japanese
                            militarists.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: The Secretary of the Treasury
                            informed me today that conversations were being held with Mr. Chen and
                            his mission in an effort to define any possible action of use to China
                            and within the scope of practicability for this Government. Up to the
                            present, I think the discussions have dealt with silver and the
                            possibility of speeding up purchases. The Secretary asked whether I
                            thought Mr. Hull would care to receive Mr. Chen on a purely courtesy
                            visit. I expressed the judgment—subject to correction—that Secretary
                            Hull would rather not at the present moment, in view of the fact that
                            there would be nothing specific to tell him and the extreme pressure of
                            events. I suggested that later on when the discussions had defined any
                            possibilities of action would be a better time.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of the Treasury said that Chen was being completely candid
                            with him and that the Chinese situation was getting desperate, and he
                            thought this was the very last chance we would have of making a
                            contribution to the Chinese ability to sustain themselves. He referred
                            to the consequences of having the Western Pacific so completely under
                            Japanese control.</p>
                        <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0567"/>
                        <p>He said that as soon as the discussions had defined themselves he would
                            ask Mr. Hamilton and myself to come over to receive a report.</p>

                        <p>The Chinese Ambassador accompanied by his Counselor called upon me this
                            morning to discuss the prospects for receiving any form of assistance
                            from the American Government. Dr. Feis was present at my request.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador referred to the strong indications given to him by both
                            the President and the Secretary of the Treasury of their disposition to
                            furnish some form of assistance. He said that he understood that the
                            question of whether this would, or would not, be done is dependent upon
                            whether the State Department would give consent; and that he was seeking
                            a clear understanding of the situation prior to his prospective
                            departure.</p>
                        <p>After reference was made to the importance to China of our silver buying
                            program, a short outline of the situation as it stood at the present
                            moment was given to the Ambassador. He was informed that one reason
                            certain possible forms of action previously had proved abortive was the
                            lack of knowledge on the part of this Government of facts essential to
                            determine the feasibility or desirability of various suggestions; and
                            that now systematic discussion was going on between the Chinese
                            Commission and the Treasury Department in an effort to ascertain all the
                            facts pertinent. It was anticipated when and as the Treasury had
                            reviewed the whole factual situation, and had given thought to all the
                            possibilities, that the question would again come before the State
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed the view that one type of assistance— relief
                                assistance<note n="37" xml:id="d572fn37">See also <ref
                                    target="frus1938v04#pg_571">vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">iv</hi>,
                                    pp. 571</ref> ff.</note>—could be treated in the vanguard of the
                            discussions taking place or apart from them. He reiterated that he had
                            received the impression both from the President and the Secretary of the
                            Treasury that all the important information necessary for relief effort
                            was at hand, and that the matter was simply one for decision. He had in
                            mind particularly a reinstatement of the earlier wheat and cotton loan
                            whereunder shipments of foodstuffs, fabrics (or he added raw cotton),
                            medical supplies, and trucks to distribute these products could be
                            effected. He indicated the view that these products could <pb n="564"
                                xml:id="pg_564" facs="0568"/>be shipped primarily to Hong Kong for
                            distribution in the various areas under Chinese Government control.
                            However, he added, in response to a direct question, that the Chinese
                            Government would also consider it useful to have these products
                            distributed as far as North China, through Tientsin and
                            Shanghai—provided the military authorities would permit.</p>
                        <p>He re-emphasized the sense of urgency in view of the near approach of
                            winter, saying that the prospect that tens of millions of his countrymen
                            would suffer from intense cold and hunger during this winter, unless
                            assistance could be given. He, therefore, said that he hoped any study
                            of the subject would not be unduly prolonged.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Carson, of Davis, Polk and Wardwell, telephoned me yesterday
                            afternoon to inform me that the credit transaction between the Guaranty
                            Trust Company and the Chinese Government, which was discussed with me
                            some weeks ago, would be completed today. The contract would be signed
                            by the Chinese Ambassador. It provided for a loan by the Guaranty Trust
                            Company of $10,000,000 for I believe two years, at a low rate of
                            interest, against the security of $10,000,000 of United States
                            Government bonds to be put up by the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>I conveyed to him, as in our previous conversations, our perplexity as to
                            the motives of the Chinese Government for entering into such a
                            transaction. Mr. Carson said that as far as they could understand the
                            matter, it was being carried out for psychological reasons, and that
                            since it was seemingly legitimate business, the Guaranty had decided to
                            execute it. After consulting with Mr. Hamilton, I informed Mr. Carson
                            the Department had “no comment to make” on the transaction.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that the Treasury is now in discussion with the
                            Chinese financial mission, I conveyed word of the prospective
                            transaction to the Treasury. Mr. Lochhead of the Treasury telephoned me
                            this morning and stated that he had passed the information on to the
                            Secretary of the Treasury, and had been requested to say that the
                            Treasury likewise had “no comment to make” about the transaction.</p>
                        <p>However, he said that the Treasury had curiosity in regard to its terms
                            and character, and thought it possible, for example, that the <pb
                                n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0569"/>Chinese Government didn’t
                            actually have the bonds, but might first be credited with the
                            $10,000,000, with them would buy the bonds, and deposit the bonds as
                            security. In the wish to get further information, Mr. Lochhead asked me
                            if I would not tell the interested parties this morning that the
                            Treasury was desirous of further details, and to ask them to telephone
                            such details to the Treasury. I said I would do so.</p>
                        <p>I telephoned Mr. Havens Grant of the same law firm this morning (Mr.
                            Carson being away from New York), and Mr. Grant said he would
                            immediately telephone Mr. Lochhead.</p>

                        <p>1294. There is a persistent rumor in local foreign banking circles today
                            to the effect that a wheat and flour or wheat and cotton loan amounting
                            to approximately $50,000,000 United States currency has been concluded
                            or is about to be concluded between the Central Government of China and
                            the Government of the United States. The local exchange market is very
                            nervous and this office has received several inquiries from banks and
                            business houses regarding the reliability of this rumor.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as such a loan would likely have a marked effect upon the
                            official Japanese attitude towards American interests in China, any
                            information that the Department may feel can properly be communicated to

                        <p>The Ambassador, during his call, said that the Ambassador of China at
                            London had called at the Foreign Office and represented that this
                            Government was doing different important things in aid of China and that
                            the British Government was not making any particular showing in this
                            direction; that his earnest appeal was that something be done by Great

                            I would be glad to do this. I also said that it was not necessary for me
                            to refer to the large purchases of silver from China by this Government

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Reference is made to our
                            conversation regarding a suggested loan of $20,000,000 by the
                            Export-Import Bank to a Chinese owned American trading company, the loan
                            to be guaranteed by the Government of China or the Bank of China and the
                            proceeds used to buy agricultural products and manufactured goods in
                            this country for export to China.</p>
                        <p>In 1934 we agreed to lend China $50,000,000 to be used in the purchase of
                            cotton and wheat. Only $17,105,385.80 of this credit was used. In 1931
                            the Grain Stabilization Corporation, a Government agency, sold China
                            15,000,000 bushels of wheat for a consideration of $9,212,826.56. The
                            unpaid portions of these credits were taken over by the Export-Import
                            Bank in April 1936.</p>
                        <p>In April 1937, a loan of $1,600,000 was authorized for the purchase of
                            locomotives in this country. Disbursement of $733,200 on this loan was
                            made in April 1938. It matures monthly over a period of five years.</p>
                        <p>It will be seen that our total Government credits to China since
                            September 1931 aggregate $27,051,412.36. $14,419,892.36 has already been
                            repaid and the balance is being paid as it matures. $3,801,055.62,
                            including interest, has been paid since September 30, 1937, the last
                            payment having been made September 30, 1938.</p>
                        <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0571"/>
                        <p>While it is not possible to foresee the outcome of the present situation
                            in China, it is probably safe to assume that China will pay her debts,
                            and if none of the purchases in this country would be in conflict with
                            the Neutrality Act, I see no reason why the credit should not be made.
                            Particularly since it is contemplated the borrowers will sell to
                            American importers Chinese products necessary for us to import, for
                            delivery within the period of the maturity of the note, approximating
                            the amount of the credit.</p>
                        <p>The Export-Import Bank would need to be put in funds through the purchase
                            by the RFC of its preferred stock in the amount of the credit. The
                            President approving, the Bank is prepared to make the loan under
                            suitable provisions to assure the disbursement of the funds in this
                            country for the purchase of American products.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Lochhead of the Treasury Department telephoned and said that Chinese
                            bankers now in this country discussing financial matters with the
                            Treasury Department had recently stated informally to him that the
                            Chinese Government had certain silver at Shanghai which was available
                            for sale to the U. S. Treasury; that the U. S. Navy transport <hi
                                rend="italic">Chaumont</hi> was now in Chinese waters; that the <hi
                                rend="italic">Chaumont</hi> would probably need ballast on its
                            return trip to the United States; that the Treasury might care to
                            purchase this silver from the Chinese Government and have it transported
                            to the United States on the <hi rend="italic">Chaumont;</hi> and that if
                            the Treasury Department was interested in this, it might also be
                            interested in making similar arrangements for the purchase of silver now
                            at Tientsin. Mr. Lochhead said that he had told the Chinese bankers that
                            this would not, in his opinion, be a purchase by the Treasury Department
                            of silver, but would be the purchase of a diplomatic incident which
                            would go outside the range of pure Treasury business. Mr. Lochhead said
                            that he had indicated to the Chinese bankers that the Treasury
                            Department wanted to keep matters on a strictly financial basis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lochhead said that this whole matter had been handled by the Chinese
                            bankers and by him in an informal and unofficial way. He said that he
                            thought we would be interested in the approach made by the Chinese
                            bankers and that, as he had mentioned to me once before in regard to the
                            silver at Shanghai, the Treasury Department was in position, if we
                            should so desire, to become interested in this silver.<note n="42"

                            last evening requested me to bring before you the following—stating that
                            he had tried to get in touch with you after the Cabinet meeting and
                            later in the afternoon and had failed both times and that he was
                            requesting me to bring the matter before you for the sake of expedition
                            since it would come under discussion at his luncheon meeting with the
                            President on Monday next, November 14.</p>
                        <p>He stated that the discussions which he had been conducting with Mr. Chen
                            (and incidentally with Jesse Jones, Chairman of the R. F. C., and
                            various American oil companies) in regard to a plan whereunder advances
                            would be made to the Chinese Government, indirectly through corporations
                            set up in the United States and China, against future shipments of tung
                            oil from China, had been virtually completed the day before Canton fell
                            into Japanese hands. He had suspended discussion to watch
                            developments.</p>
                        <p>The project had then again been discussed with the President. The
                            President had stated that if satisfactory assurances were received from
                            Chiang Kai-Shek that resistance from [<hi rend="italic">to</hi>] Japan
                            would continue, he would carry through the project. The President had
                            authorized him to communicate this word to Chiang Kai-Shek through Chen.
                            He had done so. The assurances were now received in the form of the
                            attached letter.<note n="43" xml:id="d578fn43">Not attached to file copy

                        <p>It is assumed that all officers of this Government who have considered
                            the tung oil project in question desire that China be not defeated by
                            Japan and that Japan not succeed in subjugating China. That certainly is
                            the attitude of the writer of this memorandum. However, in examining the
                            project in as nearly an objective manner as possible, factors as follows
                            appear to be important.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The project is in my opinion not practical and is
                                unsound from a business point of view.</hi></p>
                        <p>The Chinese Government still controls about 75–80% of the wood-oil
                            producing territory in China. However, the chief exporting center,
                            Hankow, is under Japanese control, as are the chief communication
                            outlets for this commodity, the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers. Hunan and
                            Szechuan Provinces are the main producing areas. Hunan is in process of
                            being conquered by the Japanese and will probably fall to them within
                            two or three months. By the time the Chinese Government could put into
                            operation any plan for assembling and exporting wood oil, its supplies
                            would not be sufficient to meet the terms of the arrangement and it
                            would be faced with very difficult transportation problems. The
                            transportation facilities which would be available would not, in my
                            opinion, be adequate and transportation could be effected only in an
                            uneconomic way.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The project would project the United States into the
                                conflict without, however, having any decisive effect upon the
                                outcome.</hi></p>
                        <p>The project would mean the abandonment by the United States of the course
                            of non-involvement and impartiality which has heretofore been followed.
                            It would thus mean action contrary to the thought underlying and the
                            spirit of the Neutrality Act. But it would not vitally affect the
                            outcome of the hostilities. If the United States wishes to do that, it
                            must throw its whole weight behind China.</p>
                        <p>A tremendous event has occurred in China and it would be a mistake, in my
                            opinion, to underestimate it. Japan has occupied the entire coast and
                            all the most important centers. Whether Japan will be able in the long
                            run to pacify the country and make effective its control, only time will
                            tell, but the positional military struggle is nearing an end.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">It is questioned whether Congress and the country
                                would approve such a project.</hi></p>
                        <p>It is believed that the isolationist and non-involvement sentiment in the
                            Congress and in the country is still strong. Congress might with warrant
                            take the position that it did not appropriate funds to be used <pb
                                n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0574"/>for the purpose of enabling the
                            United States to assist one party in a foreign conflict. Congress might
                            see fit to restrict the Government agency (the Export-Import Bank)
                            actively handling the project in such a way as to impair the future
                            usefulness of the agency (in&gt; for example, South America). Should the
                            attitude of Congress and the country be unfavorable, the fact that the
                            Administration had approved the project might serve to give added
                            support to those who favor the adoption of the Ludlow amendment<note

                        <p>If the Chinese Government is to furnish the United States with large
                            quantities of wood oil, the Chinese Government must virtually monopolize
                            sales in and exportation from the territory it controls. As pertinent to
                            the question of China setting up such a monopoly and the United States
                            being party thereto, there is quoted article III of the Nine Power

                        <p>Japan would naturally view the project unfavorably. She would probably
                            make representations to this Government against what she would call an
                            unfriendly act. Japan would also probably intensify her action in China
                            against American lives and interests. New frictions and incidents
                            between Japanese and Americans would be likely to develop, in China and
                            to some extent in Japan. What the reaction of the American people to the
                            worsened situation would be I do not know: the American people might
                            call for stronger action by their Government; equally, they might press
                            for isolationism. The adoption of this one project would not, in my
                            view, lead to armed conflict between the United States and Japan. It
                            would, however, lessen whatever chance there is of salvaging some of our
                            rights and interests in China through processes of reason,
                            argumentation, patience and skillfully applied pressure.</p>
                        <p>Japan might declare war against the Chinese Government, set up a blockade
                            against third-power shipments, and by declaring war bring about
                            invocation of our Neutrality Act. Would invocation of that Act stop the
                            project in question? It would render illegal further carrying on of
                            private transactions of that character. Should a governmental
                            transaction be carried through, even though it might be exempt
                            technically from the provisions of the Neutrality Act?</p>
                        <p>It is my view that to adopt a course of assistance to China now, after
                            Japan has almost completed its positional warfare, would be of no
                            decisive aid to China and would be a profitless irritant to Japan,
                            unless the United States is prepared to give really substantial and
                            long-continued assistance to China. And if that decision be made, it
                            should be made with realization that that course may lead to armed
                            conflict with Japan.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that the wise course for the United States to pursue in
                            regard to Japan’s actions in China is not to aid China, but bring
                            pressure to bear upon Japan. Such a course would not be taking sides. We
                            would retaliate against Japan because of Japan’s injuring American
                            rights and interests. In my opinion, such retaliatory measures should be
                            applied patiently and judiciously over a considerable period of time.
                            They might have very little, if any, immediate effect upon the outcome
                            of the conflict between Japan and China. They would, however, assist in
                            there gradually emerging in China a situation whereunder the United
                            States might continue to enjoy some measure of general equality of
                            treatment.</p>
                        <p>I am not one of those who believes that war between the United States and
                            Japan is inevitable. Nor even that war need be probable. I believe that
                            the United States must keep itself amply strong in arms <pb n="572"
                                xml:id="pg_572" facs="0576"/>to ensure that Japan realize our
                            strength. And with that strength in the background, I believe that the
                            United States by tactful, patient handling of problems in relations
                            between the two countries can avert, without loss of dignity, an armed
                            conflict.</p>

                        <p>In considering the tung oil project, the American Government should, in
                            my opinion, first of all give intensive consideration to certain
                            political aspects of the problem presented and related problems. The
                            political implications and possibilities of the project are far more
                            important, both as regards our foreign relations and as regards our
                            internal situation, than are the economic aspects of the matter. In this
                            memorandum I shall speak, briefly, only of certain of the political
                            aspects.</p>
                        <p>It is an important interest of the United States that Japan not gain
                            control of China. It therefore would be to our interest that Chinese
                            resistance to Japan’s effort to gain that control continue. The Japanese
                            nation today is animated by concepts and is pursuing objectives which
                            are in conflict with the concepts and the legitimate objectives of the
                            people of the United States. The Japanese are embarked upon a program of
                            predatory imperialism. Unless the Japanese march is halted by the
                            Chinese or by some other nation, the time will come when Japan and the
                            United States will be face to face and definitely opposed to each other
                            in the international political arena. It is desirable that the
                            development of such a situation be prevented. It therefore is desirable
                            that the United States act toward the preventing of such a
                            development.</p>
                        <p>The American Government should formulate and adopt a program of action (a
                            diplomatic “war plan”) toward averting an armed conflict between the
                            United States and Japan. In the conducting of our relations with Japan
                            and with China we should not take haphazard and unrelated steps. Such
                            action as we may take in the realm of use of words should be related to
                            action which we may plan to take in the realm of material pressures
                            (positive or negative, or both). It should be our objective to have
                            Japan’s predatory march halted. Our course of action should, therefore,
                            be a course in opposition to that march. That march will be halted only
                            by the power of resistance of material obstacles and material pressures.
                            Any nation which definitely opposes that march should be prepared in
                            last analysis to <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0577"/>use, if it
                            prove necessary, armed force. The Chinese have already found resort to
                            armed force necessary. China’s resistance may possibly be overcome by
                            Japanese armed force. Resistance which may be made by other countries
                            may in the long run have to take the form of armed force. This country,
                            therefore, in formulating its course of action should make it its
                            business to be prepared if necessary to use armed force.</p>
                        <p>The American Government has during recent years been opposing Japan by
                            use of words (appeal to principles, to rules of law, to provisions of
                            treaties, etc.). Our Department of State may be able to get the better
                            of the Japanese Foreign Office—though even that is not certain—in the
                            field of argumentation, but victories on our part in that field will not
                            halt the forward march of Japan’s military machine. The fact is that
                            unless the United States expects and intends to use weapons stronger
                            than those of argument, continuance on our part along that line is
                            almost certain to lead to the development of a situation in which this
                            country will have either to accept a diplomatic defeat or find itself
                            forced to resort to arms. The more we talk and the longer we refrain
                            from resort to some substantial measures of positive (material) pressure
                            toward preventing the Japanese from taking or destroying our rights,
                            titles and interests in the Far East, the more likely will it be that
                            resort by us to such measures at some future time—if and when—will be
                            replied to by the Japanese with resort to armed force against us, which
                            would, in turn, compel us to respond with armed force.</p>
                        <p>The most practicable course for us to follow would be that of giving
                            assistance to the Chinese and withholding those things which are of
                            assistance to the Japanese, toward prolonging and strengthening China’s
                            resistance and curtailing Japan’s ability to continue military
                            operations against China. If and when, however, we commit ourselves to
                            that line of action, we should do so wholeheartedly and with
                            determination. We should not take some one step without expecting,
                            intending and being able to take further steps, many further steps, in
                            the same direction. Such steps should include a combination of
                            diplomatic, economic and potential military pressures. If this
                            Government wishes to embark upon such a course, it should be prepared to
                            consider seriously the taking of such steps as denunciation of the U.

                        <p>The tung oil project is a project the objective of which is to give
                            assistance to China. The amount of assistance which would be given by
                            the consummation of this transaction alone would not be sufficient
                            substantially to influence the situation in which resides our problem.
                            If this Government, speaking and acting for the American people, is
                            prepared to move forward with a comprehensive program along such lines
                            as are indicated above, consummation of the tung oil project would be in
                            line with and consistent with such an attitude and intention. But unless
                            such is the case, consummation of the tung oil project would achieve so
                            little and be accompanied by hazards and possibilities of complications
                            so great that consummation of that project would not, it is believed, be
                            advisable.</p>
                        <p>Decision whether to consummate or not to consummate this project should
                            be made not on the basis of the inherent merits or demerits of the
                            project and not on the basis of the desire of this country that China be
                            not defeated by Japan but on the basis of and in the light of a decision
                            by the American Government to exert itself actively and intensively
                            toward throwing the weight of this country’s capacity into a general
                            effort to halt Japan’s predatory advance. It is the belief of the
                            undersigned that the American Government should consciously and
                            definitely commit itself (the Government) to such an effort and that it
                            should formulate a comprehensive general plan of procedure toward that
                            end.</p>

                        <p>The Treasury Department’s barter and credit proposal with regard to China
                            is almost purely political. It would not be considered—certainly by
                            Japan—as a mere commercial transaction, but as a transaction one of the
                            major purposes of which would be to aid China in her military activities
                            against Japan.</p>
                        <p>Naturally, all American Government officials are equally desirous of
                            getting rid of surplus production and they are also equally anxious to
                            see Japan defeated in her purpose by the exercise of force to dominate
                            the Far East and repudiate and render inoperative the Nine Power Treaty.
                            In these circumstances all of our Government officials, therefore, would
                            be equally disposed to see this Government indulge in any word or act
                            consistent with its situation and short of the serious risk of becoming
                            involved as a party in the military <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575"
                                facs="0579"/>conflict between China and Japan that would be
                            calculated to discourage the Japanese military objective and to
                            encourage Chinese military resistance.</p>
                        <p>Japan, viewing as she undoubtedly would the proposed transaction as one
                            of definite aid to China in the fighting against Japan, would complain
                            bitterly and charge the United States with having made itself a party to
                            the conflict on the side of China. The military clique in control would
                            map Japan’s actions in return and they would in all probability include
                            increasing injuries to American citizens and American interests in
                            China, and perhaps one or more methods of retaliation. This transaction
                            and the incident relating to it when combined with other acts, which
                            might follow, of injury and possible retaliation by Japan would result
                            in a serious possibility of this country being drawn ultimately into the
                            war, as stated.</p>
                        <p>If it is desired to go forward with these possible developments in view,
                            then it would be all-important that the American people and the Congress
                            be disposed and ready to support this new policy, and this would include
                            the sending of the Navy farther beyond Hawaii than at any time in
                            similar circumstances within recent years.</p>
                        <p>Great Britain and France are and for a time will be preoccupied with
                            Western European exigencies. China is understood to have adequate
                            military supplies for the next six to ten or twelve months. There would
                            be time for further developments and their full consideration in the
                            meantime.</p>
                        <p>I cannot in the light of all the foregoing, as well as numerous other
                            pertinent facts and circumstances which I have not the time now to
                            enumerate, either advise or concur in the course proposed.</p>

                        <p>13. The President has informed me and he has also informed the Secretary
                            of the Treasury that he desires to go ahead with the tung oil project. I
                            have conferred with the Secretary of the Treasury and have suggested
                            that implementation be held in abeyance until the President returns to
                            Washington next week. The Secretary of the Treasury has agreed to this
                            suggestion. Upon the return of the President to Washington I propose to
                            call to his attention again the views which you expressed in your
                            memorandum of November 14 and to raise for his consideration the
                            question of general policy and procedure <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576"
                                facs="0580"/>in reference to the Far Eastern situation and the
                            question whether he desires to continue for the time being the policy
                            and procedure which this Government has heretofore followed and to
                            proceed with the tung oil project as an isolated act.</p>
                        <p>The problem presented is, as you know, especially complicated by virtue
                            of the fact that positive commitments have been exchanged between very
                            high officials on both sides. In view of this fact along with other
                            considerations, our opinion and Treasury opinion at this moment lean
                            toward treating the project under consideration, if consummated, as an
                            independent and self-contained commercial transaction.</p>
                        <p>I should greatly appreciate any suggestions or comments in addition to
                            those contained in your memorandum of November 14 which you would like
                            to have me present to the President.</p>

                        <p>1389. 1. In a conversation this noon Cadogan<note n="53"
                                xml:id="d583fn53">Sir Alexander M. G. Cadogan, British Permanent
                                Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.</note> said the
                            British Cabinet had under consideration a proposal looking toward the
                            support of the Chinese currency.</p>
                        <p>2. The Chinese Ambassador here had approached the British Government
                            regarding a loan, suggesting specifically that if British banks could
                            provide a minimum of 3 million pounds to establish an equalization fund
                            to support the Chinese currency, Chinese banks would supply an equal
                            amount. The Hong Kong [and] Shanghai Bank would make the British loan
                            under a Government guarantee.</p>
                        <p>3. Cadogan went on to say that the Ambassador had indicated that a larger
                            loan, either 5 or 10 million pounds, would, of course, be better.
                            Cadogan, however, intimated that the British Government, if it acted at
                            all, would not be disposed to go beyond the 3 million figure.</p>
                        <p>4. Cadogan said he was uninformed as to whether the Chinese had
                            approached us on this subject but if the British Government knew whether
                            we were contemplating parallel action, this would naturally have an
                            effect on their decision.</p>
                        <p>5. He expressed the opinion that the British had an interest in the
                            maintenance of the Chinese currency and that the British Government <pb
                                n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0581"/>had a right to look to the
                            Japanese. He added that he thought the Japanese however recognized its
                            value in their own interest. But he did not know whether they would
                            object.</p>
                        <p>6. He indicated that the Government here would greatly appreciate
                            receiving our reaction.</p>

                        <p>8. Your 13, December 2. I cannot of course pass upon the finality of any
                            commitments which may have been taken towards the Chinese
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>My judgment remains that it is unlikely that the arrangement would be
                            accepted by American opinion as an isolated commercial transaction and
                            Japanese Government circles will certainly not so regard. It probably
                            will impede any neutrality legislation if it is done. We should be
                            clearly prepared to deal with the grave possible consequences if the
                            Japanese Government should decide to retaliate and I believe it
                            important that this aspect of the matter as set forth in the memorandum
                            presented to the President again be further considered.</p>

                            upon Mr. Hornbeck by appointment made through the British Embassy. Mr.
                            Bewley accompanied Mr. Hall-Patch. Mr. Hornbeck asked Mr. Hamilton to be
                            present.</p>
                        <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0582"/>
                        <p>Mr. Hall-Patch inquired whether Mr. Hornbeck would prefer to ask him
                            questions or to have him proceed with general comments in regard to the
                            situation in China and in Japan. Mr. Hornbeck suggested that Mr.
                            Hall-Patch give us the benefit of his general comments and said that as
                            Mr. Hall-Patch proceeded with these comments we might wish to ask
                            certain questions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hall-Patch talked first about the currency situation in north China.
                            He said that in north China the Japanese military was determined to have
                            its way and to regard north China as more or less a possession of Japan.
                            He said that, contrary to the advice of Japanese financiers and of
                            Japanese commercial and trading circles, the Japanese military had
                            insisted on inaugurating in north China a new currency which was tied to
                            the yen. Mr. Hall-Patch said that if the Japanese military were
                            successful in making this new currency completely effective, foreign
                            trade in north China would be stopped, because in his opinion the new
                            exchange could be made effective only as a result of the setting up of a
                            very rigid system of exchange control accompanied by general control of
                            import and export trade. He said that he thought this new currency
                            system in north China would work to the economic disadvantage of Japan
                            but that the Japanese military was insistent that the new currency
                            supplant the old currency. He mentioned the fact that the existence of
                            the concessions at Tientsin and the continued circulation in the
                            concessions of the old standard currency were definite obstacles in the
                            way of the success of the new currency. He observed that so long as the
                            foreign traders could continue to use this old currency, they might hold
                            on in north China. He mentioned definite measures which the British and
                            the French at Tientsin were taking (or were considering taking) to keep
                            some of the old currency in circulation.</p>
                        <p>With regard to central China, Mr. Hall-Patch said that the situation
                            there was different from that obtaining in north China in that in
                            central China the Japanese Army had not as yet insisted upon introducing
                            the new currency. He said that there were substantial elements among the
                            Japanese which opposed the introduction into central China of the new
                            currency. He mentioned Mr. Kodama, the head of the new Japanese Central
                            China Development Company, as one of those who strongly opposed the
                            introduction of the new currency into central China. He expressed the
                            view that those elements among the Japanese who did not wish to see the
                            new currency introduced into central China had a reasonable prospect of
                            having their view prevail unless the Chinese Government currency should
                            collapse. He intimated that he did not see how the Chinese Government
                            could prevent such a collapse for very much longer, because the Chinese
                            Government’s only means of maintaining its currency were <pb n="579"
                                xml:id="pg_579" facs="0583"/>remittances from abroad and the sale of
                            Chinese Government silver, the supply of which was now not large. He
                            said that in his opinion the collapse of the Chinese Government currency
                            would be a serious blow to Japan as well as to the Chinese Government;
                            also that such collapse would be a particularly heavy blow to foreign
                            trade.</p>
                        <p>In reply to inquiry, Mr. Hall-Patch said that it was his estimate that
                            the will to resist still continued among the Chinese who he thought
                            would henceforth engage in very little positional fighting. He said that
                            some disintegration had already set in among the Chinese within the
                            occupied areas and that he expected this disintegration to continue as
                            the months passed. He said that in his opinion the Japanese needed to
                            get some respectable Chinese to head the new regimes which they were
                            setting up in China; that if they could get such a respectable Chinese,
                            some of the Chinese merchant and banking classes as well as peasants
                            would probably incline to discontinue their active opposition to the
                            Japanese. He said that such Chinese as the Japanese had up to the
                            present been able to persuade to come forward as officials of new
                            regimes were not respected by any element among the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a further inquiry, Mr. Hall-Patch said that in his opinion
                            the chances as matters stand are that the Japanese will attain their
                            objective in China. He said that he thought achievement of this would,
                            however, require a matter of ten to twenty years, after which he felt
                            that the Chinese would gradually throw off the Japanese yoke. He said
                            that during this period of from ten to twenty years it was his view that
                            Japan would become an increasing menace to the rest of the world.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the question whether in his opinion it was possible for
                            foreign governments to take effective action to restrain Japan, he
                            expressed the view that thoroughgoing economic embargoes on both imports
                            from and exports to Japan would be effective but that he did not think
                            such action was possible. He said further that if such action should be
                            taken he thought it likely that Japan would take positive action of a
                            military character against one or more of the countries which adopted
                            such redressive action against Japan. He said that even the more
                            conservative element in Japan was now as a result of the fall of Canton
                            and Hankow “flushed” with the sense of victory.</p>
                        <p>As illustrative of the type of action by other countries which the
                            Japanese particularly resented, Mr. Hall-Patch said that sometime ago a
                            group of Japanese had formed a British incorporated company; that the
                            company had secured the right from one of the provinces in Australia to
                            mine certain rich deposits of iron ore; that subsequently the Australian
                            Commonwealth Government had had <pb n="580" xml:id="pg_580" facs="0584"
                            />a geological survey made of Australia and had found that the deposits
                            of iron ore in Australia were not nearly so large as had been thought
                            previously; that the Commonwealth Government had thereupon informed the
                            Japanese-controlled company which had obtained the provincial
                            government’s sanction to carry on mining operations that it (the
                            Commonwealth Government) could not approve the contract; that the
                            Japanese Government had made strong representations to the Commonwealth
                            Government pointing out that the Japanese had entered into the contract
                            in good faith, that a large amount of Japanese capital had been put into
                            the enterprise, that it was inconceivable to the Japanese Government
                            that the Commonwealth Government had not been aware of the permission
                            granted by the provincial government, and that the Commonwealth
                            Government had previously asserted its belief in the principle that raw
                            materials should be made available to countries not possessing such raw
                            materials. Mr. Hall-Patch said that he anticipated that the Japanese
                            Government would carry this matter to London. (His account of this
                            matter gave the impression that he thought well of the Australian
                            action.)</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as Mr. Hornbeck had another appointment, Mr. Hall-Patch and Mr.
                            Bewley went to Mr. Hamilton’s office where Mr. Adams and Mr. Jones
                            joined them. After Mr. Hornbeck had seen his additional caller, Mr.
                            Hornbeck also came to Mr. Hamilton’s office.</p>
                        <p>In reply to questions, Mr. Hall-Patch gave further interesting
                            information in regard to the details of the currency situations in north
                            and central China.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hornbeck referred to reports which had come to our attention that
                            there was a difference in opinion between British investment circles in
                            China and British trading circles in China as to the policy which the
                            British Government should follow. Mr. Hall-Patch said that he was not
                            aware of any difference and he said that British investment circles as
                            well as British trading circles had some months ago reached the point in
                            their thinking where they believed that Japanese success in the
                            hostilities with China would mean the ousting of British investment and
                            trading interests in China. Mr. Hornbeck referred to information which
                            had reached us to the effect that the British Foreign Office had some
                            time ago been in favor of making a currency loan to China but that
                            interests in the city had opposed such action and had been successful in
                            having their viewpoint prevail. Mr. Hall-Patch said that he believed
                            that the fundamental difficulty in regard to a currency loan was that
                            such a transaction would not be sound from an economic point of view and
                            he expressed the view that, if British financial circles in the city had
                            opposed such a step, they had done so on purely economic grounds. He
                            said that the British Export <pb n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0585"
                            />Credit Guarantee Department was still struggling with the question of
                            extending credits to China and that the chief difficulty in all such
                            matters was the question of security. He said that the question of
                            security was also the chief obstacle in connection with plans for
                            building the Burma–Yunnan Railway. He said that in Great Britain no new
                            credits were being extended to Japan; that existing credits were being
                            continued but when they came up for renewal were being shortened as to
                            the period of time; and that the whole trend was to place business with
                            Japan on comparatively a cash basis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hall-Patch asked whether we could see any objection to his raising
                            with the Treasury Department the question of the current exchange
                            between the British and American Governments of more detailed statistics
                            in regard to capital movements and exchange operations between the
                            United States and the Far East than appear in the Treasury Department’s
                                <hi rend="italic">Statistics of Capital Movements between the United

                            Japan are not given separately in that publication, as are the data for
                            several European countries, but are classified in the geographical area
                            of “Far East (including China, Japan, Netherlands East Indies, Straits
                            Settlements, and the Philippine Islands)”. Mr. Hornbeck stated that he
                            could see no objection to a discussion of the question with the Treasury
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>As he was leaving, Mr. Hall-Patch said that he expected to go to London
                            and after about six months to return to this country. He said that he
                            hoped to have a further talk with Mr. Hornbeck upon his return. Mr.
                            Hornbeck assured Mr. Hall-Patch that he would be very glad to see
                            him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hornbeck and Mr. Hamilton thanked Mr. Hall-Patch for his courtesy in
                            calling and for having given officers of the Department the benefit of
                            his comments and of his knowledge of current developments in China.</p>

                        <p>Sir A. Cadogan informed the United States Chargé d’Affaires in London on
                            December 3rd that to their regret His Majesty’s Government were still
                            not quite ready to furnish considered views in regard <pb n="582"
                                xml:id="pg_582" facs="0586"/>to possible punitive measures of
                            retaliation or pressure on Japan. It had, however, occurred to them, he
                            said, that third party interests in China might derive a certain measure
                            of protection and benefit if, quite apart from economic and financial
                            reprisals, steps were taken to support the Chinese currency. The Chinese
                            Government had in fact recently requested that British banks should make
                            a contribution of at least £3,000,000 sterling to a currency
                            stabilisation fund, an equal amount being put up by Chinese banks. A
                            small committee of Chinese and British bankers would control policy and
                            the operation of it through the two British banks i. e. the Hong Kong
                            and Shanghai Bank and the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China.
                            The Chinese Government intimated unofficially at the same time that if
                            foreign support could be increased to five or ten million pounds, the
                            margin of safety would make the Chinese dollar impregnable over a long
                            period.</p>
                        <p>The United States Chargé d’Affaires was informed that His Majesty’s
                            Government were in fact considering a proposal to introduce legislation
                            to guarantee a contribution of £3,000,000 by the Hong Kong and Shanghai
                            Banking Corporation to the projected fund. Appropriate arrangements
                            would of course be made to try to ensure that the fund if set up would
                            be utilised solely for the purposes for which it was said to be
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>So far His Majesty’s Government have reached no conclusion in the matter
                            but their decision on the question of a contribution to a currency
                            stabilisation loan would be greatly influenced by the knowledge that the
                            United States Government were willing to take parallel and simultaneous
                            action.</p>

                        <p>As directed by Mr. Welles, I called on Mr. Oliphant this morning and
                            returned to him the papers in regard to the tung oil transaction which
                            Mr. Oliphant sent to Mr. Welles on December 9. At the same time I gave
                            Mr. Oliphant the original of the attached memorandum and told him that
                            we felt definitely that an amendment along the lines set forth in the
                            memorandum should be made. I told him also that we would like to see the
                            contract amended so as to provide that title should pass to the American
                            corporation upon delivery of the commodity in the United States and I
                            said that we would feel very much happier if this change could be
                            made.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Oliphant said that they would have to study these questions. I asked
                            that the Treasury Department be so good as to inform Mr. Welles what the
                            Treasury Department, upon completion of its study, purposed doing in
                            regard to the two points which I had mentioned. Mr. Oliphant said that
                            this would be done.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently Mr. Oliphant telephoned and asked whether our points would
                            be met if there should be substituted in the contract for the proviso at
                            the end of Article 3 the proviso appearing at the bottom of page 4 of
                            the memorandum<note n="63" xml:id="d588fn63">Last paragraph of

                            provision with regard to the passing of title should be amended to read
                            “and title shall pass to the buyer upon arrival alongside wharves in
                            ports of the United States to be designated by the buyer in its absolute
                            discretion.” I said that these amendments would satisfactorily take care
                            of the two points we had raised. Mr. Oliphant then asked whether the
                            contract, with these two amendments, was satisfactory from our point of
                            view. I replied that of course we had not undertaken to pass upon the
                            business aspects of the contract or upon the contract as a whole but had
                            examined it merely from the point of view of the treaties and from the
                            point of view of where it seemed advisable that title pass to the
                            American corporation. I repeated that from these two points of view the
                            amendments which Mr. Oliphant had said would be made were satisfactory
                            to us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Oliphant then asked whether he should telephone Mr. Welles or whether
                            I would inform Mr. Welles. I said that I would do so.</p>

                                    Corporation and a Chinese Corporation for the Sale by the Latter
                                    to the Former of a Stipulated Amount of Tung Oil To Be Financed
                                    in Part by a Loan by the Export-Import Bank to the American
                                    Corporation</hi></head>
                            <p>If the proposed agreement is a contract between two private
                                corporations, none of its terms, as disclosed in the draft
                                agreement, would seem to involve definite conflict with any treaty
                                of the United States although it is not improbable that it might be
                                opposed as contrary to the general purpose of Article III of the
                                Nine Power Treaty to which reference is made hereinafter.</p>
                            <p>However, if it could be established that the Chinese corporation
                                represents or acts for or at the instance of the Government of China
                                it would be difficult to avoid the conclusion that the financing of
                                the transaction by an agency of the United States would in practical
                                effect involve an agreement between the Government of China and the
                                Government of the United States, the principal objective of which
                                would seem to conflict with the provisions of two treaties to which
                                the United States is a party.</p>
                            <p>This statement is based on the provision of Article 3 of the draft
                                contract which provides: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p rend="flushleft">“that the amount of oil required to be
                                        delivered under this contract in any one year shall not
                                        exceed three-fifths of the total oil produced in China
                                        during that year.”</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">When it is considered that the area in which the
                                supply of oil must be obtained represents only a part of the tung
                                oil producing area of China and that a considerable quantity of that
                                production is needed for local consumption it will be apparent that
                                the supply deliverable under the contract might exhaust all of the
                                available supply in the area in which the contract may be given
                                effect. This would close or seriously restrict the market to all
                                other prospective purchasers and would seem to be inconsistent with
                                Article XV of the treaty of 1844 between the United States and China
                                and Articles I, II and III of the Nine Power Treaty of 1922.</p>

                        <p>419. 1. This afternoon the Reconstruction Finance Corporation issued a
                            statement to the press as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Jesse Jones today announced that the Export-Import Bank has
                                    authorized credits to the Universal Trading Corporation of New
                                    York up to $25,000,000, the proceeds to be used in financing the
                                    exportation of American agricultural and manufactured products
                                    to China, and the importation of wood oil from China. The loans
                                    will be guaranteed by the Bank of China and mature over a period
                                    of 5 years. The funds will be disbursed as needed.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Jones further announced that of the $50,000,000 loan
                                    authorization to China in 1934, only $17,105,385.80 was used. In
                                    April 1937 a loan of $1,600,000 was authorized for the purchase
                                    of locomotives in this country. This loan matures monthly over a
                                    period of 5 years. In 1931 the Grain Stabilization Corporation
                                    sold China 15,000,000 bushels of wheat for a consideration of
                                    $9,212,826.56.</p>
                                <p>All of these credits are now handled by the Export-Import
                                    Bank.</p>
                                <p>The total actual disbursements for loans to China since 1931 have
                                    been $27,051,412.36. $14,419,892.36 has been paid and the
                                    balance is being paid as it matures. $3,801,055.62, including
                                    interest, has been paid since September 30, 1937, the last
                                    payment having been made September 30, 1938.”</p>

                                by “British and American assistance to Chiang Kai Shek and efforts

                            <item>An editorial this morning in the <hi rend="italic">Asahi</hi>,
                                which is the only one which has thus far appeared, describes the
                                circumstances as set forth in the announcement of the Reconstruction
                                Finance Corporation and concludes that the credits to the Universal
                                Trading Corporation, which it characterizes as a “phantom
                                corporation,” is substantially similar to the British export
                                guarantee to China. “In American financial circles the view is held
                                that this loan was made to China, with Japan held in view and for
                                the purpose of increasing China’s power of resistance, that it is a
                                political loan, and that it is intended to be a gesture in the
                                direction of Japan in connection with questions arising over the
                                principle of the Open Door and equality of opportunity. It is
                                reported that Anglo-American discussions are taking <pb n="588"
                                    xml:id="pg_588" facs="0592"/>place with a view to concerting
                                measures in the nature of economic reprisals against Japan. In
                                addition to these measures the United States, it is understood, is
                                considering various measures which the President is authorized by
                                law to take in the event of any foreign nation discriminating
                                against American goods.” The various forms of retaliatory action
                                which are reported to be under consideration between United States
                                and Great Britain are then reviewed, and the editorial concludes:
                                “International assistance to Chiang Kai Shek in his efforts to
                                continue resistance is now beginning to take shape. Apart from
                                Soviet Russia it goes without saying that the prime mover is Great
                                Britain. Whether the United States will pull Britain’s chestnuts out
                                of the fire is an open question, but one fact is clear, and that is
                                that the grant of British and American credit loans to China will
                                help the expiring Chiang Kai Shek spiritually, more than materially,
                                and that these loans derive only from a malicious desire to
                                stimulate Chiang to continue resistance.”</item>

                            London of the imminent granting of British credits to China was greeted
                            in Chinese official and private circles with marked elation. The
                            Minister of Finance is reported in the press as having expressed
                            gratification “at this further evidence of America’s friendly interest
                            in China’s progress and development, which China will not forget”. “This
                            credit,” Dr. Kung is quoted as saying, <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589"

                            potentialities and will enlarge American trade in China”.</p>
                        <p>The local press has given much prominence to the matter of which the
                            motive [<hi rend="italic">view</hi>?] of the <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung
                                Pao</hi> on December 17 is representative. This journal emphasizes
                            that the credit is purely commercial, that it constitutes a fresh
                            testimonial of Sino-American friendship, that China despite financial
                            difficulties will continue to fulfill its financial obligations, and
                            that though purely a commercial transaction it will have the political
                            effect of dealing a blow to Japanese aggression. This paper expresses
                            the hope that the granting of these credits will cause Great Britain to
                            follow suit. The <hi rend="italic">China Times</hi> comments that the
                            significance of the granting of credits lies not in their amount but in
                            their implications which in its view amount to the first step on the
                            part of Great Britain and the United States in making a “concrete reply”
                            to Japan’s wish to set up a new order in East Asia and that they
                            constitute a warning that “Chinese cooperation with the European powers
                            and the United States cannot be destroyed.” The fact that the credits
                            came after the fall of Wuhan is noted and the conclusion drawn that
                            Anglo-American recognition of the National Government has not been
                            affected by military or political developments. The extension of
                            Anglo-American credits to China is held not only to manifest the
                            traditional friendship existing between China and these Anglo-Saxon
                            powers but to reflect the commencement by Great Britain and the United
                            States of steps to implement the League resolutions to assist China.</p>

                        <p>793. Department’s 419, December 15, 7 p.m. The following statement, as
                            furnished to us by Hugh Byas,<note n="71" xml:id="d593fn71">Tokyo
                                representative of the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> and the
                                London <hi rend="italic">Times.</hi></note> was made this afternoon
                            by the Foreign Minister in reply to questions at a press conference with
                            the foreign correspondents: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Mr. Arita: An early cessation of hostilities in China is
                                    earnestly desired not only from the standpoint of peace in East
                                    Asia but for the sake of the nationals of third powers in China
                                    as well as of the 300,000,000 Chinese. Reported foreign loans to
                                    the Chiang Kai-shek regime though they may be purely trade
                                    propositions will necessarily lead to the prolongation of
                                    hostilities and the consequent embarrassment and inconvenience
                                    of foreign nationals. The report <pb n="590" xml:id="pg_590"
                                        facs="0594"/>of an American loan is therefore an opportunity
                                    to say what we cannot but say: it is a regrettable act on the
                                    part of the United States which has hitherto acted with
                                    discretion and understanding in Chinese affairs; and if, as the
                                    United States papers say, it is a political gesture of the
                                    United States towards Japan, I think there will be nothing more
                                    dangerous.</p>
                                <p>The Japanese people may regard that the present loan is really
                                    intended as economic pressure by a powerful economic unit, and
                                    its results will prove quite contrary to what is expected by
                                    America. At least the Japanese people will undoubtedly find new
                                    grounds for strengthening the proposed new order in East
                                    Asia.</p>
                                <p>Personally, I am surely not inclined to regard the loan as a
                                    political gesture towards the activities of Japan.</p>
                                <p>Asked if those remarks would apply to a loan by Great Britain and
                                    how he would regard the prospect of common economic pressure by
                                    the United States and Great Britain, the Minister replied: ‘I
                                    say exactly the same thing; this applies to a British loan. But
                                    personally I am inclined not to regard that kind of loan as a
                                    political gesture’.”</p>

                        <p>Under instruction by the Under Secretary, Mr. Welles, I made oral reply
                            to Mr. Mallet today. I said that I understood that the Treasury

                            expressed. I asked whether, in these premises, this oral reply on our
                            part would be satisfactory to the British Embassy. Mr. Mallet said that
                            it would and that he would report to his Government, as the Department’s
                            reply, what I had said.</p>

                        <p>Possible routes still available to China for the import of war materials
                            are: (1) Alma Ata or Serglopol (on the Turksib Railway) by highway or
                            air to Urumchi to Lanchow; (2) Semipalitinsk or Irkutsk by highway or
                            air to Uliassutai to Lanchow; (3) Verkhne–Udinsk by rail to Urga and
                            thence by highway or air to Lanchow. From Lanchow a highway leads to
                            central China via Sian. (4) Hong Kong by rail, highway, or steamer to
                            Canton and from there to central China by rail. (5) Haiphong (French
                            Indochina) by rail to Yunnanfu and thence by highway to central China or
                            from Haiphong by rail to Langson and from there by highway to Lungchow
                            (Kwangsi), Nanning, Kweilin, and central China. (6) Another possible
                            route which apparently has been used very little, if at all, is from
                            Rangoon by rail to Myitkyina or Lashio, or by river steamer to Bhamo and
                            thence by mule caravan to Tailfu, 440 kilometers west of Yunnanfu, from
                            which city there are motor roads to central China. This route is, of
                            course, impractical for anything but small arms and ammunition and is
                            slow (60 days or more from Rangoon to central China). (7) A few supplies
                            are reported to have entered by way of Macao (thence by highway to
                            Canton) and (8) Kwangchowwan from where they are shipped by highway to a
                            redistribution point on the West River.</p>

                            favorably in the near future total only $104,430.00. The value of
                            American arms (this term is used in a broad sense and includes military
                            equipment and munitions of war) entering China may actually be higher
                            than these figures would indicate, as Hong Kong has reported that there
                            are believed to be arms agents there selling American arms originally
                            exported to South America but refused by the consignees there. Where
                            these arms are stored at present is unknown. There are also at Hong Kong
                            rumors that American arms are arriving there via Australia and
                            Manila.</p>
                        <pb n="593" xml:id="pg_593" facs="0597"/>
                        <p>Official British figures (communicated to the Ambassador at Tokyo about
                            February 1) show that of the war materials passing through Hong Kong 62%
                            are of German origin, 21% Italian, 12% French, 3% British, and the
                            remaining 2% American and Belgian. Although there is little information
                            in regard to the origin of arms entering via Indochina, it appears
                            probable that they are almost entirely of French, Belgian, and possibly
                            Czechoslovakian manufacture. Assuming that all supplies entering via
                            Lanchow are Russian, the countries supplying arms to China may be ranked
                            roughly as follows: Germany or Russia, Italy or France, Belgium, Great
                            Britain, Czechoslovakia, United States, Sweden, Denmark. A large order
                            for automatic weapons including 7.92 mm. machine guns, anti-aircraft and
                            anti-tank guns, and 20 mm. automatic cannon has been placed with the
                            Danish Industrial Syndicate. The size of this order is indicated by the
                            fact that seven Chinese officers have been sent to the factory in
                            connection therewith. These supplies are to be shipped by sea from
                            Hamburg, but it is not known whether deliveries have yet begun. The
                            absence of Denmark from the British list of countries of origin
                            mentioned above would seem to indicate that no part of the order had
                            arrived at the time that list was compiled, a date which is not
                            definitely known but which is probably near the first of the present
                            year. There have been several definite figures mentioned in reports but
                            it is not believed that listing them would greatly help in understanding
                            the situation as they do not pretend to be accurate, refer to different
                            periods, and bear no indication as to the type of supplies which they
                            include.</p>

                            immediately.</p>
                        <p>After some preliminary conversation of no significance, I told the
                            Ambassador that I was disturbed by the fact that during the current
                            month licenses had been granted authorizing the exportation to Japan of
                            arms to the value of $893,983.06, whereas the corresponding figure <pb
                                n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0598"/>in respect to China was only
                            $176,044.31. I explained why the Department had adopted the policy of
                            publishing monthly statistical summaries of licenses issued by this
                            office, and I pointed out that the figures which I had just given him,
                            with such modifications as might result from licenses issued between now
                            and the end of the month, would be published during the first week in
                                April.<note n="81" xml:id="d598fn81">Released April 4; see

                            had been recently emphasized by persons who desired the immediate
                            application of the Neutrality Act<note n="82" xml:id="d598fn82">Joint
                                resolution approved May 1, 1937, amending earner legislation; 50

                            physically possible for China to import arms purchased in the United
                            States and that therefore the invocation of the act would penalize Japan
                            without affecting exports to China. I said that, although I realized, of
                            course, that China was still finding it possible to import arms,
                            nevertheless a publication of these figures might tend to give the
                            opposite impression and might result in further agitation in this
                            country for the immediate invocation of the Neutrality Act. I suggested
                            that, if the Chinese Government had already placed any further orders
                            for arms in this country which might be ready for export in the near
                            future, it might be advisable for the companies with which the orders
                            had been placed to apply for export licenses within the next few days in
                            order to increase the valuation of arms authorized for export to China
                            before the publication of the March statistics.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he entirely agreed with me as to the result
                            which the publication of these figures might have. He said that he would
                            see to it that applications for further export licenses were made within
                            the next few days if his Government had placed any further orders for
                            arms in this country. He disclaimed any knowledge of the orders which
                            might have been placed and under which applications for licenses might
                            be made.</p>

                        <p>522. With reference to press report that the French Government had
                            recently suspended munitions supply to China over the Hanoi-Yunnanfu
                            Railroad, an official of the Far East section of the Foreign Office has
                            told us that there has been no change in policy, which is to <pb n="595"
                                xml:id="pg_595" facs="0599"/>approve applications for shipments
                            ordered prior to last August and started before October. It appears
                            however that it has been possible for some subsequent shipments to evade
                            this control and there have been other shipments originating in French
                            Indo-China which are not strictly subject to it. Shipments from France
                            must be approved by the Defense Ministries also and of late these have
                            been authorizing very few arms exports, with the result that the French
                            munitions supply to China has been considerably diminished principally
                            because of France’s own military needs but has not been interrupted.</p>
                        <p>Our informant added that the French were still fearful that the Japanese
                            might endeavor to cut off this supply altogether by bombing the railroad
                            from planes based on carriers off Hainan. They thought the attack would
                            be confined to that part of the line beyond the French frontier but as
                            the entire railroad belonged to them they wished to avoid giving
                            provocation.</p>

                        <p>Military supplies from abroad enter China principally by three routes:
                                (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Lanchow; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                            French Indochina; and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Hong Kong.</p>

                        <p>A radio report just received from an American military observer who made
                            a special trip to Lanchow gives information as follows:</p>
                        <p>Shipments of military supplies from Russia passing through Lanchow are
                            estimated to average less than 25 tons daily. The material consists of
                            aircraft supplies, including gasoline, bombs of various sizes up to
                            approximately 1,500 pounds, machine guns and ammunition for artillery
                            and small arms. During December, 1937, 15 anti-aircraft guns and a few
                            searchlights were received. Six light tanks arrived this year but there
                            have been no further shipments of artillery. A total of 300 airplanes of
                            all types, which is believed to be the entire shipment expected, has
                            already arrived at Lanchow. Trucks in use on this route have a capacity
                            of three tons. They are guarded by armed Russians en route and by
                            Chinese guards at halting points. From 120 to 150 truckloads of material
                            are now arriving weekly. Strict secrecy on these shipments is being
                            maintained and information is most difficult to secure.</p>
                        <p>It is estimated by officers of the War Department that the ammunition and
                            aviation gasoline entering China by Lanchow is primarily for the use of
                            the Russian equipment, such as airplanes, anti-aircraft guns and tanks
                            shipped by the same route. The present flow of <pb n="596"
                                xml:id="pg_596" facs="0600"/>munitions is believed to be sufficient
                            to maintain those weapons in action. If the tonnage capacity, as
                            indicated above, of this route is utilized for general munitions, it is
                            believed that the volume would be sufficient to supply the needs of only
                            about three and a half divisions (45,000 to 55,000 men) engaged in
                            military operations.</p>
                        <p>The American military observer who visited Lanchow has been directed by
                            the War Department to forward more detailed information via air mail.
                            This air mail report should reach Washington in approximately 2
                                weeks.<note n="83" xml:id="d600fn83">Dated April 16, not

                        <p>Military supplies entering China via French Indochina are shipped by two
                            routes: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) by rail to the Kwangsi border
                            (Lungchow) and from there by motor direct to central China or to a
                            transshipment point on the Canton–Hankow Railway; and (<hi rend="italic"
                                >b</hi>) by rail to Yunnanfu.</p>
                        <p>A radio report just received from an American military observer who made
                            a special trip to Lungchow (on the Kwangsi side of the Kwangsi–Indochina
                            border) gives information as follows:</p>
                        <p>Since February 7 an embargo has been established on shipments by rail of
                            munitions from other than French sources. After March 1 the embargo also
                            included French material. While the French Colonial Ministry is reported
                            to have authorized munitions shipments, the local Governor General is
                            reluctant to permit their passage for fear of Japanese reprisals. The
                            embargo does not apply to articles which can be classed as commercial.
                            Under this liberal interpretation, airplane engines, engine parts,
                            gasoline, oil and many other articles may be shipped. A highway from
                            Dongang, on the railway in French Indochina, to Kweilin, capital of
                            Kwangsi, via Nanning, able to take five-ton loads, is now complete. A
                            hard surfaced road connects Don-gang with Haiphong. A water route is
                            also open via Wuchow.</p>
                        <p>The American military observer who visited Lungchow has been directed by
                            the War Department to forward more detailed information via air mail.
                            This air mail report should reach Washington in approximately 2
                                weeks.<note n="84" xml:id="d600fn84">Dated April 15, not

                        <p>With regard to the statement that since February 7 an embargo has been
                            established on shipments by rail through French Indochina, the American
                            Embassy at Paris telegraphed on April 2 that according to the French
                            Foreign Office there had been no change in French policy which is to
                            approve applications for shipments ordered prior to last August and
                            started before October. The Embassy reported further that there had been
                            some evasion of the French control and that other shipments which
                            originated in French Indochina were not strictly subject to the control.
                            The Embassy stated that because of <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597"
                                facs="0601"/>France’s own military needs the French munitions supply
                            to China had been considerably diminished.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Yunnanfu, the American Consul at that place reported under
                            date January 29 that there had arrived at Yunnanfu a shipment of war
                            materials consisting of 32 light tanks, 6 or 8 airplanes, and 1800 tons
                            of explosives, mostly bombs. The Consul reported further that he
                            understood that another shipment of 1500 tons was then at Haiphong
                            awaiting transportation to Yunnanfu.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Hong Kong.</hi></p>
                        <p>It has recently been learned that the Government of Hong Kong is
                            forwarding fortnightly to London data in regard to war material passing
                            through Hong Kong. The American Embassy at London has been asked by
                            telegraph to request that the British Government supply it with these
                            data fortnightly or monthly. No reply has as yet been received from the
                            Embassy at London.</p>
                        <p>Under date February 25 the American Consul General at Hong Kong reported
                            that, based on first-hand observation, the traffic in war materials via
                            Hong Kong appeared to be substantial and continuous. The Consul General
                            forwarded a report by the Hong Kong correspondent of a Japanese
                            newspaper giving a list of supplies reported to have reached China
                            through Hong Kong between February 1 and February 15. The Consul General
                            expressed the opinion that these figures were not greatly exaggerated.
                            The figures are as follows: <table rows="7" cols="2">

                        <p>A further route which may become of importance in connection with the
                            supply of arms and munitions to China is from Rangoon to Lashio,
                            railhead in Burma, and thence by motor truck to Yunnan. A motor highway,
                            approximately 550 kilometers in length, is now being built from the
                            Burma border to Tali, a city in western Yunnan from which highways lead
                            to central China and Szechwan via Yunnanfu and Kweichow. Recent reports
                            from the Consulate at Rangoon indicate that some 200,000 coolies are
                            working on this road and that strict orders have been issued for its
                            completion by May. It is believed, however, that even if a road of some
                            sort is completed by that time it will not be practicable for use by
                            motor vehicles during the rainy season from June to November. It is also
                            believed that the potential importance of this route has been
                            exaggerated in the press, as the geographical difficulties in the way of
                            construction and maintenance are enormous.</p>
                        <p>The non-completion of a motor road connecting Burma and Yunnanfu does
                            not, of course preclude the possibility that small arms and ammunition
                            may be brought in by pack animals over the route to be followed by the
                            road or over the main caravan routes from Bhamo and Myitkyina. It would
                            probably take in the neighborhood of 60 days to transport goods from
                            Rangoon to central China over either of these routes.</p>

                        <p>Chinese Government arsenals can manufacture limited quantities of small
                            arms of all types, machine guns, trench mortars, light artillery, and

                            pounds are also manufactured. China must of course import certain raw
                            materials to complete the manufacture of these munitions.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Richard M. Mock, American representative of N. V. Neder-landsche
                            Vliegtuigenfabriek Fokker, called me by telephone from New York this
                            morning. He referred to the pending application by the Douglas Aircraft
                            Company for a license to export three planes to Outer Mongolia. He said
                            that Mr. Douglas had sent a telegram to the Douglas representative in
                            Hong Kong and had instructed him to proceed to Hankow to confer with the
                            Chinese authorities with a view to having them send appropriate
                            instructions to the Chinese Ambassador in Washington, in order that the
                            latter might inform the Department that his Government wished an export
                            license to be issued. He said that Mr. Douglas had now received a
                            telegraphic reply from his representative at Hong Kong saying that his
                            visit to Hankow had been fruitless as the Central Government was
                            unwilling to send instructions to its Ambassador to Washington until the
                            Urga Government had requested it to make arrangements to admit the
                            planes. This, it was understood, the Urga Government was unwilling to do
                            as it considers itself independent of the control of the Central
                            Government in respect to such matters.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Mock said that he was leaving tomorrow for Europe, and that he hoped
                            that when the situation had been made clear to his principals they might
                            find it possible to persuade the Urga Government to take action. He said
                            that he feared, however, the Urga Government would refuse to take the
                            necessary action and Outer Mongolia would hereafter purchase planes
                            exclusively in countries which were not so meticulous in the issuance of
                            export licenses.</p>
                        <postscript>
                            <p>This is an absurd situation. I shall take up the question once more
                                with the Chinese Ambassador if FE<note n="86a" xml:id="d601fn86a"

                                might possibly serve any useful purpose. For my part, our past
                                experience leads me to the conclusion that further conversation with
                                the Ambassador would probably be of no avail. I suggest, therefore,
                                that we should consider the advisability of making an exception in
                                regard to these planes. The President’s Proclamation of January 31,

                                approval from the Chinese Embassy, the license could be legally
                                issued forthwith.</p>
                            <p>I should appreciate it if I might discuss this situation with you at
                                your convenience.</p>

                            Company, Incorporated, called at my office this morning. He said that

                            efforts of the Douglas representative in Hong Kong to persuade the
                            Chinese Government to instruct its Ambassador in Washington to inform
                            the Department that it desired that a license be issued authorizing the
                            exportation of three planes to Outer Mongolia, were based on a telegram
                            received from Hong Kong. He said that, since my conversation with Mr.
                            Mock, Douglas had received a letter from its agent in Hong Kong which
                            told in considerable detail of his conversations in Hankow and of his
                            failure to persuade the Chinese Government to take action. To the utter
                            astonishment of the Douglas agent, and according to the agent to the

                            planes to Outer Mongolia and had added a suggestion that this Government
                            obtain assurances from the Soviet Government that the latter had no
                            objection to the importation of these planes into Outer Mongolia and, if
                            such assurances were received, that it proceed to issue the necessary

                            enables me to give you a more complete estimate of the munitions traffic
                            into China. Therefore the following information is submitted.</p>
                        <p>It is estimated that over 75 per cent of the military supplies imported
                            into China since the start of the hostilities have been routed through
                            Hong Kong. The routes of entry for the remainder in order of their
                            importance are French Indo China, Russian Turkestan, Kwangchowan (French
                            leased territory on the Kwangtung coast 220 miles southwest of Hong
                            Kong), Macao, and Burma. A negligible amount of military supplies may
                            enter China from Siberia via Urga. Similarly small quantities may pass
                            through the Japanese blockade into ports on the China Coast.</p>
                        <p>Extensive road and railway construction and improvement are now in
                            progress with a view toward bettering communications with countries
                            bordering China and so facilitate shipments of military supplies. In
                            Yunnan, the caravan route from Talifu to Burma is being improved into a
                            road suitable for wheeled traffic, and an extensive road net is being
                            constructed connecting Yunnanfu, the terminus of the French railway from
                            Hanoi, with roads leading north, east and west. In Kwangsi railroads and
                            roads are under construction connecting the railway terminus at Langson,
                            French Indo China, with the Canton-Hankow railway via Nanning and
                            Kweilin. The long route from Russian Turkestan has in large part been
                            made suitable for heavy hauls in all weathers.</p>

                            furnished the largest percentage as well as the largest variety <pb
                                n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0606"/>of military supplies. Other
                            countries furnishing munitions in order of their probable importance are
                            Russia, Italy, England, France, United States, Belgium, Sweden, Austria,
                            Switzerland, and Denmark. The heavy German participation in the munition
                            trade to China is probably due to a barter agreement between the two
                            countries concluded in 1935 and to the presence of the German advisers.
                            Practically all the materials purchased from Germany can be procured
                            elsewhere provided China can secure the necessary credit or provide
                            foreign exchange.</p>
                        <p>Chinese claim they now have sufficient supplies on hand for one more year
                            of warfare.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that the military supplies now being imported into China
                            together with the reserve on hand are sufficient to maintain the Chinese
                            forces in defensive operations on the present extensive scale. It is
                            estimated that a minimum reserve of four months’ supply of essential
                            military supplies are now in China either in arsenals and supply dumps
                            or en route thereto.<note n="91" xml:id="d603fn91">The Under Secretary

                            definitely that there is no chance that the Urga Government can be
                            induced to ask the Chinese Government to instruct its Ambassador to
                            request the Department to issue a license authorizing the exportation of
                            the three planes which the Douglas Aircraft Company wishes to export to
                            Outer Mongolia. I suggest, therefore, that, in view of the
                            considerations set forth in my memorandum of May 31, we consider the
                            possibility of taking immediate action to facilitate the exportation of
                            those planes. I suggest that appropriate procedure might be for me to

                        <p>I called the Chinese Embassy by telephone yesterday afternoon intending
                            to request the Chinese Ambassador to come to see me in order to discuss
                            with him the matter of the three DC–3 commercial passenger transport
                            airplanes which the Douglas Aircraft Company, Incorporated, desires to
                            export to Outer Mongolia. Mr. Ing, Counselor of the Embassy, told me
                            that the Ambassador was out of town and would be away several days. I
                            therefore asked him to call.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ing called this morning.</p>
                        <p>I explained the situation to him, emphasizing particularly that, if the
                            necessary export license were not issued, the only practical effect
                            would probably be that an American manufacturer would lose the business
                            and that planes would be purchased in some other country and sent to
                            Outer Mongolia without the permission, and perhaps even without the
                            knowledge, of his Government. I said that, in view of the situation
                            which had arisen, the Department proposed to issue the necessary export
                            license unless we were informed within the next few days that his
                            Government objected to its issuance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ing said that he did not believe that his Government had any
                            objection and that, if the Ambassador approved, he proposed to inform me
                            by telephone on Monday that the Embassy had nothing to say further than
                            that it had received no instructions in the premises.</p>
                        <p>It was obvious from what Mr. Ing said that he personally approved the
                            procedure which I had suggested and that he hoped that the necessary
                            export license would be issued.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Zaung Teh Ing, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy, called me by
                            telephone this morning. He read me a translation of a telegram from the
                            Chinese Foreign Office in regard to the exportation of three DC–3 planes
                            to Outer Mongolia. The telegram stated that the Foreign Office had
                            informed our Ambassador a month ago that it could not give permission
                            for the importation of planes into Outer Mongolia unless the Outer
                            Mongolian Government would request that such permission be granted, and
                            that the situation remained unchanged.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ing said that he had received the note addressed to the Ambassador on
                            June 29 informing him that the export license had been issued and that
                            he supposed that that settled the matter.</p>
                        <p>I referred to our conversation on June 24 and said that in view of what I
                            had told him at that time we had decided to issue the license unless his
                            Government expressed strong objection to such action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ing said that as he read the telegram from the Foreign Office it was
                            not intended to express objection. He pointed out that it merely stated
                            that the Central Government could not grant permission.</p>
                        <p>I gathered from Mr. Ing’s tone that the Embassy was not in any degree
                            displeased at the issuance of the license.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that it is
                            authoritatively stated that the question of duty on war materials that
                            may be shipped, through Burma in transit to China is receiving the
                            consideration of the Government. Under regulations now in effect such
                            materials would be subject to full tariff rates on importation into
                            Burma, and there would be no drawback on re-exportation to China
                            (despatch No. 52 of March 3, 1938<note n="94" xml:id="d608fn94">Not
                                printed.</note>). A drawback of seven-eighths of the duty is allowed
                            on goods in general. It is considered probable that a concession will be
                            made to China, but a decision in the matter has not yet been
                            reached.</p>
                        <p>The Collector of Customs is authority for the statement that no advance
                            shipments of arms or ammunition or other war materials for China have
                            entered Burma.</p>
                        <p>Customs statistics covering the first half of July 1938 show only usual
                            imports of arms and ammunition for dealers, valued at Rupees 4,372
                            ($1,617). The United States shared to the extent of $904, that amount
                            representing the value of 40,400 rifle and revolver cartridges, 12,000
                            shotgun shells, and 18 rifles and two shotguns. The other imports were
                            chiefly shotgun shells and were from Great Britain.</p>

                            materials are continuing to be received at Haiphong and to be despatched
                            from there across the border into China. Details as to the quantities of
                            the various commodities comprising the traffic are not known.</p>
                        <p>Presumably no munitions are being accepted by the railroad line which
                            runs to Yunnanfu (because of an agreement with the Japanese). Airplanes,
                            gasoline, etc. are not on the list of banned articles. Munitions are
                            generally routed by rail from Haiphong through Hanoi to Langson, on the
                            border, where they are transshipped by motor truck into China. There is
                            said to be an extremely heavy traffic over this route.</p>

                            Maritimes arrived at Haiphong from France early in the second week of

                            displacement, 18,006; gross, 7,997). To minimize the risk of an
                            explosion in the port of Haiphong, the vessel’s cargo was discharged
                            with great despatch and the railroad service was practically given over

                            delivery to the Chinese Government. This stuff is urgently needed. The
                            memorandum is dated September 1, 1938. The material offered for sale
                            consists of: <list>

                        <p>702. Japanese protest concerning shipment of arms via French Indo-China.
                            My French colleague<note n="96" xml:id="d611fn96">Charles Arsene-Henry,
                                French Ambassador in Japan.</note> confirms the report that he was
                            recently called to the Foreign Office by Prince Konoe who as Foreign
                            Minister protested in general terms against the alleged shipment of arms
                            and munitions for the Chiang Kai Shek Government through French
                            Indo-China. The Foreign Minister stated that a similar <hi rend="italic"
                                >démarche</hi> was being made simultaneously through the Japanese
                            Ambassador at Paris. Prince Konoe stated that if such shipments were not
                            stopped “certain steps would have to be taken” but he did not specify
                            what those steps would be.</p>
                        <p>The French Ambassador replied in a general denial of the allegation that
                            any arms or munitions had been shipped into China through French
                            Indo-China since the frontier had been closed by the Indo-Chinese
                            Government to all munitions traffic and demanded specific evidence.</p>
                        <p>By the way of elaborating on this question my French colleague informs me
                            that in every case where specific complaints have been made of such
                            contraband shipments the French Government has investigated with the
                            greatest of care and in no single instance has the allegation of the
                            Japanese been found to be true. He said that allegations involving
                            individual instances of shipments undoubtedly arose from false
                            information given for a fee by irresponsible individuals to Japanese
                            consular officials in French Indo-China. He further stated that in his
                            opinion the general allegation of shipment of arms through French
                            Indo-China originated with and was kept alive by certain interested
                            circles in Japan probably with the support of the navy in whose interest
                            it was to furnish any excuse to further the southward advance policy by
                            the seizure of Hainan Island and a blockade of the Gulf of Tongking.</p>
                        <p>Arsene-Henry has reported fully to his Foreign Office but he has as yet
                            received no reply.</p>

                        <p>61. The French Consul at Hong Kong has notified shipping companies
                            verbally that the transit of “war materials” through Kwangchowwan and
                            Haiphong is suspended. This prohibition includes motor trucks,
                            presumably only those for military use, but the instructions received by
                            my French colleague are not clear on that point and he has written
                            requesting clarification thereof. He has informed the local
                            representative of General Motors that motorcars would be allowed to pass
                            through these two ports but presumably only when they are not destined
                            to the Chinese Government. A shipment of 12 American motor trucks from
                            Hong Kong to Kwangchowwan consigned to the Highway Bureau of Szechwan
                            Province was not allowed to land by the French authorities and has
                            returned to this port.</p>
                        <p>The opinion has been expressed in some quarters that the French will be

                        <p>1937. The Chinese Ambassador<note n="98" xml:id="d615fn98">V. K.
                                Wellington Koo.</note> told me yesterday that his Government would
                            be greatly concerned over the closing of the French Railway in
                            Indo-China to the passage of war supplies. With the cutting of the
                            Canton–Hankow Railway the French Railway becomes of vital necessity to
                            the Chinese Government. He said that he had spoken with Bonnet<note
                                n="99" xml:id="d615fn99">Henri Bonnet, French Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs.</note> at various times recently requesting that some way
                            be found to permit in secret the passage of supplies, that Bonnet had
                            promised to take it up with Daladier<note n="1" xml:id="d615fn1">Edouard
                                Daladier, President of the French Council of Ministers
                                (Premier).</note> but that on the tenth of this month Bonnet had
                            informed him that it would be impossible for the French to permit any
                            war material, even that ordered before the outbreak of hostilities, to
                            pass over the railway.</p>
                        <p>Wellington Koo said that the French Government was frightened that the
                            Japanese would make reprisals if the French relaxed control over the
                            railway. He had asserted to Bonnet that the Japanese were in no position
                            to risk an attack on French possessions in the Far East. Bonnet,
                            however, insisted that France could not act alone and that only if
                            France were guaranteed the support of the United States and Great
                            Britain could she risk offending the Japanese.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Ambassador said that he had suggested to Bonnet that this
                            matter might be discussed during the Chamberlain–Halifax<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d615fn2">Neville Chamberlain, British Prime Minister, and

                        <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0614"/>
                        <p>Wellington Koo said that he had the definite impression that Bonnet was
                            so concerned with the European situation and with domestic affairs in
                            France that he paid but slight attention to Far Eastern questions and
                            left them to others in the Foreign Office.</p>

                                <p>“It is reported here that motor trucks are now included in the
                                    list of war materials the transshipment of which through French
                                    Indo-China is allegedly prohibited. Purchasers here of American
                                    trucks are being seriously inconvenienced by this situation. It
                                    is rumored that difficulty can be avoided by paying the full
                                    Indo-China import duty on trucks instead of only the usual 4 per
                                    cent transit tax. If this is the case it would indicate
                                    discrimination against American trucks as it is understood that
                                    French trucks are not subject to import duty in Indo-China. A
                                    representative of the Owult Motor Car Company has recently
                                    arrived in Yunnanfu for the alleged purpose of establishing a
                                    branch agency here. This would not appear to be warranted unless
                                    that Company contemplated large scale sale of trucks as the sale
                                    of passenger cars at present is inconsiderable. French Consulate
                                    here professes to know nothing about this matter but I have
                                    already received one complaint in this regard.”</p>

                                <item>following start of hostilities the Japanese informed the
                                    French authority that they were aware of foregoing law and also
                                    of transshipments of arms and munitions through Haiphong to
                                    China. The Japanese considered this activity to be of an
                                    unfriendly character, particularly as it involved official
                                    sanction on the part of a high French official, and requested

                                <item>the French Government therefore decreed that military supplies
                                    for which orders had been placed before the end of October 1937
                                    would be permitted to pass through Indo-China, but that those
                                    ordered after that date would be denied shipment.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The informant stated that in his opinion any relaxation in the
                            restrictions now imposed would have to be carried out gradually. He
                            added that after the fall of Canton the Chinese authorities had
                            endeavored to ship approximately 1,000 motor trucks into China via
                            Haiphong and Kwangchouwan and inasmuch as facilities at those ports were
                            limited congestion had occurred. To ameliorate this condition the French
                            authorities had taken steps to limit such shipments, an action which had
                            been misconstrued by the Chinese as an extension of the restrictions
                            applying to transshipments through French territory. He alluded to this
                            as an erroneous conception and said that the French Government had no
                            intention of restricting the passage of commercial products through
                            French territories to China.</p>

                        <p>2049. Department’s 896, December 1, 5 p.m. I have discussed this question
                            with Hoppenot, Chief of the Far Eastern Division at the Foreign Office.
                            He states that motor trucks are not included in list of war materials
                            the transshipment of which through Indo-China is prohibited. He also
                            states that the “rumor” that difficulties can be avoided by paying the
                            full Indo-Chinese import duty is entirely untrue because in fact no
                            difficulties exist.</p>
                        <p>He says that the only types of trucks which are refused transit are those
                            manifestly designed or capable of being used for military purposes such
                            as caterpillar types, those fitted with gun mounts, et cetera. He says
                            that after the capture of Canton permission was refused for a short time
                            for the transit of all trucks through Indo-China because such a large
                            number of them were diverted there that time was required to sift out
                            the “non-military” trucks from the “military” trucks. Instructions since
                            then have been given to the Governor General of Indo-China to authorize
                            the transit of all “non-military” trucks and motorcars.</p>
                        <p>Hoppenot asserts that there is therefore no discrimination as between
                            American cars and trucks and French cars and trucks and adds that if we
                            will furnish him with information regarding any specific case in which
                            difficulties are encountered he will be glad to send the necessary
                            instructions to the Governor General.</p>

                            Government, I have the honor to convey to you the following
                            communication:</p>
                        <p>Since the beginning of the Japanese military aggression in China not a
                            day has passed without the Japanese aircraft severely bombing Chinese
                            open towns and inflicting heavy loss to the civilian life. For the past
                            several days the Japanese airplanes have continuously raided Canton, one
                            of the most populous cities in China and deliberately bombed and
                            machine-gunned residential sections of the city far from any military
                            objectives killing and wounding several thousand non-combatants
                            including a great number of women and children. The action was indeed
                            savagely cruel and the scenes were indescribably appalling.</p>
                        <p>It may be recalled that on September 28, 1937, the Assembly of the League
                            of Nations by a resolution<note n="7" xml:id="d621fn7">For League
                                resolution of September 27, 1937, see <ref

                                    506</ref>.</note> declared that no excuse could be found for the
                            aerial bombardment of open towns in China by the Japanese aircraft which
                            had aroused horror and indignation throughout the world and solemnly
                            condemned such action. The bombing of <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614"
                                facs="0618"/>Canton at present has proved even more daring,
                            barbarous and disastrous than any of the previous visitations by the
                            Japanese aircraft. And it is certain that if the Japanese are allowed to
                            go their own way, such air raids will yet be repeated over Canton and
                            other cities with even more terrible loss of human life.</p>
                        <p>China once more appeals to the conscience of the world. It is the earnest
                            wish of the Chinese Government that on humanitarian if on no other
                            grounds the American Government and other Governments take such urgent
                            and effective measures as will make Japan cease the wholesale slaughter
                            of human beings by aerial bombardment.</p>

                            Japanese Government in protest against the recent allegedly
                            indiscriminate bombing of Canton. The Minister for Foreign Affairs<note

                            to await possible action by myself and he therefore proposes to make his
                            own representations to the Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs<note n="10"

                            attention of the Department. Craigie proposes to leave with the Vice
                            Minister the following <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire:</hi>

                                <p>“<hi rend="italic">Aide-mémoire.</hi>—The recent air raids made
                                    upon Canton by Japanese airplanes and the large number of
                                    civilian casualties caused thereby have attracted considerable
                                    notice in the United Kingdom.</p>
                                <p>According to official reports based on careful inquiry which have
                                    reached His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, the
                                    raids of the 28th, 29th and 30th of May resulted in death to
                                    some 450 persons and injury to over 1,000; out of 60 or more
                                    sites bombed during these 3 days not 10 were of military
                                    importance and it would appear that less than one-third of the
                                    bombs were directed at airdromes, industrial plants and fairly
                                    open country.</p>
                                <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615" facs="0619"/>
                                <p>In a statement issued to the press on the 1st June the Ministry
                                    of Foreign Affairs, after claiming that the Japanese air
                                    squadrons had not attacked the civilian population for whose
                                    safety they were ever solicitous, suggested that any loss of
                                    civilian life had resulted from the aimless firing of Chinese
                                    anti-aircraft guns: that this was not so is shown by the fact
                                    that foreign doctors in Canton state that less than one percent
                                    of the wounds suffered as a result of the raids were from
                                    anti-aircraft shell fragments.</p>
                                <p>The fact that the great majority of the objectives struck by
                                    bombs were without justifiable military importance combined with
                                    the heavy death roll of civilians has aroused great feeling in
                                    the United Kingdom which cannot help but affect good relations
                                    between Great Britain and Japan. It is therefore the earnest
                                    hope of his Majesty’s Government that the Japanese Government
                                    will discontinue such indiscriminate bombing of Chinese
                                    towns.</p>
                                <p>At the same time His Majesty’s Government desire to enter a
                                    protest against the flight of Japanese airplanes over the

                        <p>357. Our 356, June 4, noon, bombing of Canton. My British colleague has
                            supplied me with the substance, as follows, of his telegram to London
                            describing his conversation on June 4 with the Vice Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I spoke to Vice Minister today as instructed, pointing out that
                                    in view of urgency of matter I had thought it best not to await
                                    return of Minister for Foreign Affairs to Tokyo. I made use of
                                    the information contained in the various telegrams from His
                                    Majesty’s Consul General at Canton.</p>
                                <p>His Excellency inquired whether our representations were based on
                                    grounds of humanity? I replied in the affirmative, adding that
                                    they were also made in the interests of Anglo-Japanese
                                    relations, having regard to the most unfavorable impression made
                                    on British public opinion by the appalling loss of life amongst
                                    the civilian population.</p>
                                <p>Vice Minister stated that reports received from Japanese Navy
                                    indicated the utmost care had been taken to confine attacks to
                                    military objectives and that no Japanese planes had flown over
                                    Shameen. Nevertheless, in view of my statement that official
                                    reports we had received were based on personal investigation and
                                    not merely on accounts from Chinese sources, Vice Minister
                                    promised that careful inquiry would be made into the facts on
                                    which His Majesty’s Government’s representations had been
                                        based.”<note n="12" xml:id="d623fn12">Further British

                        <p>192. At the press conference on June 11 the Secretary, in reply to a
                            question whether the Secretary could add anything to a story in the
                            press that he was considering some plan in connection with bombings
                            pointed toward discouraging the sale of American bombing planes abroad,
                            stated that in reference to the bombing of civilian populations and the
                            danger to Americans and American interests abroad we have put out
                            repeated public statements condemning the bombing of civilian
                            populations, that the present attitude is to maintain that position, to
                            say to everybody that we do condemn the bombing of civilian populations
                            or its material encouragement, and that we say that abroad and at home
                            to the American people and especially to the manufacturers of bombing
                            planes. In reply to a question whether the administration or the
                            Government will frown upon all future sales of American airplanes that
                            could be used for bombing purposes, the Secretary indicated that our
                            attitude will discourage sales to regions where airplanes are being used
                            to bomb civilian populations.</p>

                        <p>193. Department’s 192, June 11, 2 p.m. During the past several weeks
                            purchasing by Japan in this country of military planes has steadily
                            increased. On June 9 licenses were issued for the exportation of 14
                            planes. Moreover, Japanese interests recently approached an American
                            company with a view to the immediate purchase of an exceptionally large
                            number of bombers and there has been every indication that further very
                            large purchases by Japan of military aircraft, including bombers, have
                            been in contemplation. This situation is inconsistent with the
                            abhorrence with which this Government and the American people view the
                            current bombings of civilian populations and the attendant danger to
                            Americans and American interests abroad, as consistently and repeatedly
                            expressed by high officers of this Government.</p>

                            touch with manufacturers and exporters of airplanes and aeronautical
                            equipment to inform them orally of this Government’s desire that they do

                            civilian populations from the air.</p>

                            stating that a Soviet Chargé d’Affaires on June 17 made representations
                            to the Japanese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the
                            “bombardment of unprotected peaceful populations and unprotected
                            peaceful cities of China by the Japanese Army and especially by Japanese
                            aviation”. According to the communiqué, the bombardment of Canton
                            resulting in “many thousands of victims including a huge number of women
                            and children victims” was especially referred to in the representations
                            and it was pointed out that “the operation of Japanese aviation in
                            Canton is a completely unjustified act of brutal violence and that it
                            has called forth a feeling of the deepest indignation in the public
                            opinion of all civilized countries in the world including the Soviet
                            Union”. The Chargé d’Affaires expressed his Government’s strong hope
                            that such attacks against unprotected populations and peaceful towns in
                            China will be stopped.</p>

                            the Ambassador had just learned that the Japanese Government had closed

                            address a note to the Department, asking that everything possible be
                            done to prevent the exportation of those planes.</p>

                            our announced policy, I did not believe that a note from the Chinese
                            Ambassador on the subject of Japanese purchases would serve any useful
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Tsui said that he would report our conversation to his Ambassador,
                            and he expressed the opinion that, in view of what I had said, the

                            protest was rejected by the Japanese Foreign Office which called the

                            given to China by Soviet aviation. The Japanese Embassy here is

                        <p>424. 1. My British colleague informs me that the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs has expressed appreciation of the facts and figures and direct
                            observations of the British Consul General in Canton concerning the
                            indiscriminate bombing of that city which Craigie has periodically
                            brought to the Minister’s attention. The Ambassador thinks that the true
                            facts were obscured here and that the precise information which he has
                            furnished to the Foreign Minister has resulted in more carefully
                            controlled bombing operations.</p>

                            that a liaison officer has been sent out to exert some form of greater

                            companies in the industry were prepared to cooperate with the Department
                            in carrying out the policy voiced by the Secretary on June 11.<note

                            He said that a few manufacturers, however, would probably desire to

                            propellers, and other parts to be used as replacements on commercial
                            airlines in Japan which these companies had been supplying over a long
                            period of years. Mr. Rogers expressed the hope that the Department would
                            see fit for the present not to protest against small shipments of
                            replacement parts which were obviously to be used on commercial airlines

                            reiterating to persons who made application for export licenses the

                            presented to us, but that, if such shipments should increase in ensuing
                            months, it would, of course, give rise to the presumption that the

                            said that, of course, I could make no commitments whatever in regard to
                            this; that I would keep in mind what he said and bring it to the
                            attention of my associates, especially in the Far Eastern Division. I
                            reminded him that, of course, shipments of most of our aeronautical
                            supplies to Japan have ceased except those under contract. He seemed
                            thoroughly to understand this. I inquired what would be the state of
                            mind of other important governments abroad, such as those in Europe, in
                            regard to his suggestion. He said he had no information of a recent
                            nature but that he would be glad to see our Government take the matter
                            up with the British and other governments. I suggested that <pb n="623"
                                xml:id="pg_623" facs="0627"/>those governments are very much
                            preoccupied during present weeks with the Czechoslovak and Spanish
                            situations, and that in any event I would suggest that his Government
                            might more appropriately perhaps take the matter up through its
                            ambassadors and other representatives at European capitals. He said that
                            might be well enough.</p>
                        <p>He then inquired when the President would return, and I replied that he
                            would be back on Tuesday morning next. He said he would be glad if the
                            State Department would make an engagement for him to see the President;
                            that he desired to bring up this same important point with him. I
                            replied that I would be glad to confer with the Protocol officials, or
                            he could do so as he preferred. He said that he would be glad to see
                            them himself.</p>
                        <p>In reply to my question, the Ambassador stated that it would be some time
                            yet before Hankow would be occupied by the Japanese.</p>

                            bombing civilian populations. My British colleague has given me the
                            following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In the British view the fundamental principles might
                                    provisionally be defined as follows: in order that bombing may
                                    be legitimate there must at least be: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                                    an objective recognized as legitimate, and (<hi rend="italic"
                                        >b</hi>) an intention to attack that objective and not some
                                    other objective, and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) a reasonable
                                    prospect that any bombs dropped will in fact hit the
                                    objective.</p>
                                <p>Correspondingly, the following at least should be definitely
                                    inadmissible: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the intentional bombing
                                    of civilian populations, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the plea
                                    that the presence of a legitimate objective in the neighborhood
                                    of a civilian center justifies general bombing of the area, even
                                    when there may be a hope of hitting that objective <hi
                                        rend="italic">inter alia</hi>, and (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >c</hi>) a general and indiscriminate release of bombs even with
                                    the hope that they may hit a suspected legitimate objective,
                                    when it is not possible at the time to distinguish and identify
                                    that objective with certainty, or alternately when there is no
                                    reasonable expectation that the damage done will be restricted
                                    to the military objective.</p>
                                <p>In connection with (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) in preceding
                                    paragraph, an antiaircraft gun in the British viewpoint
                                    constitutes so small a target that it is normally only at point
                                    blank range and from a very low altitude that anyone could
                                    identify it with certainty and bomb it with a reasonable
                                    prospect of hitting it.”</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Tinkham</hi>: I have your letter of
                            September 9, 1938<note n="25" xml:id="d638fn25">Not printed.</note> in
                            which you quote two questions asked by a resident of your congressional
                            district in regard to the export of war materials to Japan.</p>
                        <p>The first question is “Could the United States Government in any way
                            without the consent of Congress forbid the export to Japan of all war
                            material?”. My understanding is that your constituent is alluding to
                            arms, ammunition, and implements of war as referred to in Section 1 of
                            the Neutrality Act.<note n="26" xml:id="d638fn26">50 Stat. 121.</note>
                            The answer to the question, in that case, is that the Government is not
                            authorized to forbid the export to any country of such articles, except
                            when the President issues a proclamation in accordance with the
                            provisions of that section. If your constituent is referring to
                            commodities other than arms, ammunition, or implements of war, the
                            answer is that this Government has no statutory authority to restrict
                            the export of such commodities to any foreign country.</p>
                        <p>The second question is “…<note n="27" xml:id="d638fn27">Omission
                                indicated in the original.</note> why could not the State Department
                            request the cessation of all such exports (as it has done in regard to
                            bombing planes) and then publish widely in the Press the names of all
                            those who disregard the request?”. In answering this question it may be
                            stated that the Department’s action in urging the manufacturers and
                            exporters in this country of airplanes and aeronautical equipment not to
                            sell or export their products to countries whose armed forces are
                            engaged in the bombing of the civilian population from the air was based
                            upon this country’s general and unreserved condemnation, to which the
                            Secretary has given expression repeatedly in public utterances, of that
                            type of activity. Only in such exceptional cases does the Department
                            take action of that advisory character.</p>

                        <p>On October 17th the Chinese Ambassador in London, acting on instructions,
                            requested that His Majesty’s Government should implement their
                            commitments under relevant League of Nations Resolutions <pb n="625"
                                xml:id="pg_625" facs="0629"/>by immediate and positive action
                            against Japan. They might declare an embargo on the export of arms and
                            raw materials, or they might apply pressure to that same end on
                            manufacturers particularly in regard to aeroplanes, steel and oil. The
                            Ambassador said that some time ago the United States Government had made
                            known its attitude that aeroplanes should not be sold to Japan; and the
                            Department of Commerce had discouraged traders from giving credit. The
                            effect of these measures had been appreciable, and it was understood
                            that further administrative steps of a similar nature were in
                            contemplation. The Ambassador hoped that it might be possible for His
                            Majesty’s Government to take parallel action to the same purpose in
                            consultation with the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>It would be greatly appreciated if His Majesty’s Government could be
                            furnished with details regarding the actions or intentions of the United
                            States Government in the directions mentioned by the Chinese Ambassador

                            are as follows:</p>
                        <p>On June 11 the Secretary of State made a statement definitely condemning
                            the bombing of civilian populations from the air. The Department of
                            State has brought that statement to the attention of manufacturers and
                            exporters of airplanes or aeronautical equipment and has informed those
                            manufacturers and exporters that this Government is strongly opposed to
                            the sale of airplanes or aeronautical equipment which would materially
                            aid or encourage the bombing of civilian populations from the air in any
                            countries in any part of the world and that the Department would with

                        <p>In June last the Department of Commerce issued a circular to its district
                            offices in which the belief was expressed that, in view of the
                            increasing severity with which exchange restrictions in Japan were being
                            enforced, it appeared advisable that exporters in the United States
                            should have a confirmed irrevocable letter of credit in their hands
                            before accepting orders for shipments to Japan.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the general attitude of this Government toward the present
                            conflict in the Far East, this Government has, since the commencement of
                            that conflict, consistently supported in appropriate and practicable
                            ways principles of policy and objectives which it believes should be
                            controlling in relations between states, and it is continuing to give
                            study to appropriate ways and means calculated to obtain respect for and
                            observance of those principles and objectives.</p>

                            Government has taken or may have under contemplation in the directions

                        <p>45. Last evening Sir Frederick Maze, the Inspector General of Customs,
                            sent me with a covering letter a strictly confidential statement which
                            he has prepared and forwarded also to the French Ambassador and the
                            British Chargé here. While the statement is somewhat involved in parts,
                            the essential features I summarize below:</p>
                        <p>The Inspector General indicates that should the situation continue along
                            present lines he would remain at his post until compelled by <hi
                                rend="italic">force majeure</hi> to leave when if possible he would
                            remove the Inspectorate elsewhere. He believes, however, that he will
                            soon be confronted with the situation of a provisional government
                            claiming jurisdiction in China and will be face to face with refusing to
                            transfer his allegiance to that regime in which case he would doubtless
                            be succeeded by a Japanese. However, should the powers desire for the
                            purpose of preserving the integrity of the service that he remain
                            temporarily, he would do so and extend limited recognition to the
                            provisional regime pending a final settlement of Sino-Japanese affairs.
                            In this case the powers should attempt to persuade the Chinese
                            Government to offer no objection to that course and the powers would
                            presumably make representations however to the <hi rend="italic">de
                                facto</hi> régime in regard to their treaty rights and controversial
                            matters such as preferential duty treatment. If the powers were not
                            prepared to take the outlined action the Inspector General might be
                            forced to resign. If the powers wish the inspectorate and the various
                            and great prerogatives so closely connected <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628"
                                facs="0632"/>with the customs to be preserved, they should be
                            prepared to assume the attitude of 1911 when the Inspector General was
                            treated not only as a servant of the Chinese Government but as a trustee
                            of foreign interests.</p>
                        <p>The Inspector General foresees the early establishment of the provisional
                            régime in Shanghai and considers that the powers should intimate to him
                            the course of action he should follow. He expressed the hope that I
                            would “continue to exercise your valuable influence in favor of the
                            integrity of the service and the so-called inspectorate system” I shall
                            not reply unless otherwise instructed.<note n="32" xml:id="d642fn32"
                                >Notation by Walter A. Adams, of the Division of Far Eastern
                                Affairs: “Decided after discussion not to instruct Gauss to reply to
                                Inspector.”</note> I feel that the present Inspector General is
                            inclined too much to seek the instructions and support of the three
                            interested powers with reference both to the Chinese Government and the
                            Japanese. It is probable however, that he will have to face the
                            situation outlined under which a provisional Chinese government set up
                            by the Japanese will demand his adherence.</p>

                        <p>46. In conversation this noon with the Japanese Consul General concerning
                            the customs situation at Shanghai, he told me that he expects
                            instructions from Tokyo within a few days and will then be in a position
                            to resume conversations. He referred to a brief conversation we had held
                            a week ago when he had mentioned to me (rather casually) that it was the
                            Japanese idea here that all revenues should be deposited in the Yokohama
                            Specie Bank and the payment of all loan and indemnity quotas suspended
                            until the cessation of hostilities as their payment regularly might
                            sustain Chinese credit abroad. He recalled that I had promptly and
                            emphatically dismissed any such idea as entirely unacceptable and he
                            later so reported to Tokyo recommending that the quotas be paid
                            regularly as due. He said he hoped his instructions would permit this. I
                            commented that I was interested to know this but that we are interested
                            not only in loan and indemnity payments but in the integrity of the
                            customs and we desire assurances on a number of important points which
                            have been made known to his Foreign Office by the Ambassador at Tokyo
                            and which I again outlined briefly on the basis of the Department’s 393

                            the opinion that the Shanghai Customs situation might find its solution
                            in the extension to include Shanghai of the jurisdiction of the
                            provisional government at Peiping. His remarks this noon on this and
                            other matters suggest to me that he expects the present unsettled
                            situation at Shanghai to continue for some time and that it is not the
                            present intention to include Shanghai under the puppet regime set up for
                            North China.</p>

                            Japanese goods and vessels.</p>
                        <p>I took this matter up informally with the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs<note n="35" xml:id="d644fn35">Koki Hirota.</note> in the
                            course of conversation on other matters this morning. The Minister said
                            that this question was now under discussion and it is hoped that some
                            solution will shortly be found. The problem he said is to separate
                            incoming war supplies for the Japanese forces from other goods. I
                            pointed out the damaging effect upon the Customs Administration of the
                            present procedure. I took occasion once again to repeat to the Minister
                            that a disruption of the Chinese customs service and inability of the
                            customs to meet foreign loan and indemnity quotas would bring most
                            unfortunate consequences to all concerned. Hirota said that the matter
                            is now under discussion and he implied, altogether without specific
                            assurances, that the final result would be entirely satisfactory to
                            American interests.</p>

                        <p>48. Reference my telegram No. 45, January 9, 11 a.m. At a meeting this
                            morning the British Chargé d’Affaires said that his instructions had
                            been to advise the Inspector General to keep his Embassy <pb n="630"
                                xml:id="pg_630" facs="0634"/>fully informed and follow its advice
                            and the Embassy would give him such support as possible. French
                            Ambassador has no instructions but is seeking them along similar lines.
                            Both diplomatic representatives are informing their Governments of the
                            purport of the statement communicated to you by my No. 45.</p>

                        <p>22. Shanghai’s 45, January 9, 11 a.m., and 48, January 10, noon. I have
                            in various ways refrained from offering any advice to the Chinese
                            Government as to what it should do about the Customs Administration,
                            confining myself on such occasions as have offered to the statement that
                            it is our hope that the integrity of the Customs Administration may be
                            preserved. On one occasion Minister for Foreign Affairs<note n="36"
                                xml:id="d646fn36">Wang Chung-hui.</note> volunteered to me the
                            information that, in reply to representations made by the British
                            Ambassador that Sir Frederick Maze be given authority to reach some
                            settlement with the Japanese which might subsequently be submitted to
                            the Chinese Government for its approval, he had stated that Chinese
                            Government was unwilling to relinquish its right to examine and approve
                            any plan prior to its acceptance. It is my belief that Chinese
                            Government will be unwilling to give its official approval to any plan
                            which deprives it of control over Customs Administration and of customs

                            Government and stated that my Government expects the Japanese Government
                            to take appropriate and prompt steps to assure the carrying out of those
                            assurances. The Minister said that he would promptly take the matter up

                        <p>113. I learn that a representative of the Japanese Consul General today
                            informed the Commissioner of Customs that the customs arrangements for
                            Shanghai are to be as follows:</p>
                        <p>Deposit of revenues in Yokohama Specie Bank in the name of the
                            Commissioner, authorization for payment of cost of collection including
                            consideration of a quota for cost of Inspectorate General, and
                            authorization to meet Shanghai quota of foreign loan and indemnity
                            payments such quota to be established in consultation with the customs.
                            Balance of revenue to remain in the account in anticipation of later
                            organization of a regional government in this area. Commissioner replied
                            that he must consult the Inspector General. Developments will be
                            reported.</p>

                        <p>114. Reference my 45, January 9, 11 a.m., and 48, January 10, noon.
                            British Chargé d’Affaires has replied to Inspector General to the effect
                            that it is not possible to give advice beforehand on hypothetical
                            situations, that British Government are doing their utmost by
                            representations at Tokyo to prevent creation of a separate tariff in
                            North China or any other action which would disrupt Customs
                            Administration, that in their view if these efforts are unsuccessful the
                            Inspector General must decide what measures are essential to secure
                            integrity of the Administration in its international form and the
                            service of foreign loans and indemnity, that they also regard deposit of
                            revenues in a neutral bank as most important, that difficulty of the
                            position of Inspector General is, however, recognized and he is assured
                            that provided he keeps Embassy informed and is guided by its advice the
                            British Government will support him to the best of their ability in any
                            difficulties which may supervene and they will continue to impress upon
                            Kung the necessity of taking a realistic view of the situation and will
                            endeavor to secure ultimate acceptance by Chinese of any arrangement
                            finally reached. French Ambassador will reply along somewhat similar
                            lines.</p>

                        <p>126. Reference my 113, January 20, 6 p.m., regarding customs. Inspector
                            General of Customs has now communicated to the British and French
                            diplomatic representatives and to me a letter from the Commissioner of
                            Customs outlining the Japanese proposals, as reported in my 113.
                            Inspector General thinks these proposals if officially confirmed by the
                            Japanese and accepted by the Chinese Government, and if scrupulously
                            observed, would protect foreign obligations and provide for financial
                            upkeep of the service but he questions whether they will prove
                            acceptable to the Chinese Government as the Shanghai revenue which is
                            normally about 50% of the total for all China would be placed in a bank
                            functioning under Japanese law and the arrangement for Shanghai might in
                            due course be extended to most if not all principal ports of China and
                            thus give Japan control over funds which in the past have served Chinese
                            domestic loans and administrative expenses. He suggests that the holding
                            of such balances by Japan might facilitate their diversion toward
                            payment of the large unsecured and inadequately secured Chinese debts to
                            Japan. He also recalls that the question of custodian banks for customs
                            revenues has long been the subject of international discussions, the
                            last occasion being at the Tariff Conference in 1926 when Japanese made
                            proposals which would have given them predominant positions through
                            their interest in unsecured debts. However, he considers the proposals
                            offer a basis of discussion and they will in due course be submitted to
                            the Chinese Government. Meanwhile he desires that our respective
                            governments be informed.</p>

                        <p>The spokesman of the Ministry of Finance of the Chinese Government issued
                            on January 24, 1938, the following statement in regard to the reported
                            revision of tariff in North China: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The announcement made by the Peiping puppet regime that modified
                                    tariff will be enforced in North China beginning from tomorrow
                                    is the most serious matter which, it is hoped, will receive the
                                    immediate attention of the world powers whose interests, besides
                                    China’s, are directly menaced. For many years, the Customs
                                    Administration has been responsible for the payment of China’s
                                    foreign obligations secured on the customs revenue. The Japanese
                                    invasion of Manchuria in 1931 has already caused serious
                                    impairment of the administrative integrity of the Chinese
                                    customs service. Notwithstanding the promise Japan made to pay
                                    from the revenue collected in Manchuria certain quotas for the
                                    payment of foreign obligations, she has not carried it out.
                                    Japan is now trying to disrupt the Chinese customs service
                                    entirely by instigating the Peiping puppet regime to modify the
                                    tariff. This move would not only destroy the integrity of the
                                    Chinese national fiscal administration, but also seriously
                                    jeopardize the interests of the foreign governments and
                                    bond-holders of all nationalities. The tariff changes made by
                                    the Peiping puppets are reported to involve considerable
                                    reductions, but obviously they are made in favor of the Japanese
                                    commodities particularly. Once the action of making such tariff
                                    changes in China by illegal organizations is not challenged,
                                    there will be little doubt that the Japanese have in their hands
                                    the powerful weapon to keep the commodities from other countries
                                    out of that part of China which is under the Japanese influence.
                                    The Ministry of Finance has wired instructions to the Customs
                                    Inspectorate General not to recognize the illegal change of
                                    tariff in North China.”</p>

                                    the country the Government should authorize him to reintroduce
                                    the 1931 tariff with some slight modifications. This should

                                    treatment for merchants of all nations would be welcomed by
                                    foreign officials and merchants alike, who have always
                                    maintained that present tariff rates are too high. Foreign
                                    powers mainly interested in equality of treatment and as
                                    reduction of rates is obviously to the advantage of their
                                    nationals they are unlikely to oppose such reduction. If
                                    Government declines to adopt Inspector General’s suggestion
                                    trade will be diverted from Shanghai and other ports to Tientsin
                                    and Tsing-tao from whence goods will penetrate by rail and by
                                    road through all occupied areas to the detriment of the
                                    Government’s prestige and expectations.”</p>

                            representatives the latter told us that the foregoing message has
                            actually not been sent as he desires first to consult London and if his
                            Government is prepared to support the suggestion he wishes to give such
                            support at the time the suggestion is presented. Neither he nor French
                            Ambassador believes that the Minister of Finance will be fully prepared
                            to approve suggestion. They both expressed the opinion that further
                            representations should be made at Toyko in opposition to tariff changes
                            by the Peiping régime or Japanese military.</p>

                            support to those views as you deem appropriate and advisable, with the
                            understanding of course that we are not prepared to commit ourselves to
                            an arrangement which calls for the nomination by the American Government
                            of an official or officials on the proposed board; but it would not
                            appear to be advisable to press the British views to the point of
                            jeopardizing discussions or negotiations looking toward the adoption of
                            an arrangement on the basis of the Japanese proposals.</p>

                            instructions on the subject, will be able to exert your influence to the
                            end that a settlement may be reached which in so far as possible
                            respects our position with regard to preservation of the integrity of
                            the customs and the safeguarding of the customs revenues, with special

                        <p>170. I discussed Shanghai customs question this morning with Japanese
                            Consul General who confirmed the conversation with the customs on lines
                            reported in my No. 113, January 20, 6 p.m. and stated he “hopes” after
                            Shanghai question is settled arrangements will be made release loan and
                            indemnity quotas at Tientsin but adds he has no jurisdiction in that
                            matter. He has no intention of submitting Shanghai arrangements to
                            interested foreign representatives here before making them effective. He
                            believes loan and indemnity quotas for Shanghai should be fixed for a
                            fairly long period—6 months or a year—and not be subject to frequent
                            revision. He asserts he cannot agree to deposit of revenues in any other
                            than Yokohama Specie Bank <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0642"/>and
                            considers assurance of payment of foreign loan and indemnity quotas
                            should satisfy foreign interests. I emphasized the American interest in
                            the integrity of the customs and again outlined the assurances desired
                            by the American Government.</p>
                        <p>2. I am inclined to believe that if pressed the Japanese may ultimately
                            agree to periodic transfer of foreign loan and indemnity quotas to
                            foreign banks after they have first been deposited in the Japanese
                            bank.</p>

                                <p>“The American Government has from time to time since the outbreak
                                    of the present conflict in China made known to the Japanese
                                    Government its very real interests in the preservation of the
                                    integrity of the Chinese customs and in the safeguarding of the
                                    customs revenues. The American Government has repeatedly urged
                                    that no action be taken or countenanced by the Japanese
                                    authorities which might undermine the authority of the customs
                                    administration, disrupt the customs service, or impair the
                                    ability of the Customs to continue the service of foreign loan
                                    and indemnity quotas and to meet administrative expenses. This
                                    Government has expressed a desire to receive from the Japanese
                                    Government certain assurances, including an assurance with
                                    regard to the continuance of existing custom tariffs and
                                    procedure.</p>
                                <p>The American Government has recently received information from
                                    its representatives in China to the effect that a provisional
                                    regime in Peiping has caused a revision to be made of Chinese
                                    customs rates on certain articles entering into the foreign
                                    export and import trade of North China. This Government,
                                    regarding the Government of China as the only authority which
                                    can legally cause a revision to be made in the Chinese customs
                                    tariff, is constrained to invite the attention of the <pb
                                        n="639" xml:id="pg_639" facs="0643"/>Japanese Government to
                                    this arbitrary and illegal assumption of authority by the
                                    provisional regime in Peiping, and to point out that the action
                                    of the provisional regime may have a seriously adverse effect
                                    upon the integrity of the Chinese Customs, with regard both to
                                    administration and to revenues, and that the revision of rates
                                    doea violence to the principle of a uniform Chinese tariff at
                                    all ports.</p>
                                <p>The Japanese Government shares with the American Government and
                                    with other Governments a long established and well
                                    recognized-interest in the integrity of the Chinese Customs
                                    administration, and the American Government has expressed its
                                    confident belief that the Japanese Government reciprocates the
                                    earnest desire of the American Government that the integrity of
                                    the Chinese Customs be respected. The action of the provisional
                                    regime at Peiping in revising rates of duty seriously threatens
                                    the integrity of the Customs. For the creation and the acts of
                                    the provisional regime the Japanese Government has an
                                    inescapable responsibility; and when those acts are of a
                                    character, as in the case of the revision of the rates of duty,
                                    which affect the interests of foreign governments, it is to the
                                    Japanese Government that those governments must address their
                                    representations.</p>
                                <p>The American Government is impelled, therefore, to state to the
                                    Japanese Government that it perceives no legality or legitimacy
                                    in the assumption of authority by the provisional regime, and
                                    that it profoundly regrets that the Japanese Government has not
                                    exercised that restraining influence which it is in position to
                                    exercise upon the authorities of the provisional regime. In the
                                    light of the existing situation, the American Government will be
                                    compelled to consider the Japanese Government responsible for
                                    any adverse effects which a revision of the rates may have upon
                                    American rights and interests, including therein trade with
                                    China and the servicing from customs revenues of foreign loans
                                    and indemnity quotas.”</p>

                        <p>179. Inspector General of Customs has today reported to the Minister of
                            Finance that the Tientsin and Chinwangtao customs have been obliged to
                            yield to <hi rend="italic">force majeure</hi> and submit to enforcement
                            of the reduced tariff rates. He has urged Government to defer any action

                                    R. Myers.</note> who says that the Peiping regime and the
                                Japanese military are now moving to obtain the release of foreign
                                loan quotas in order to separate such quotas from the remaining
                                revenue which will be treated as surplus to be dealt with by the
                                Peiping régime as it pleases. Commissioner believes Peiping regime
                                would reject any move to reintroduce the 1931 tariff. He recommends
                                that in order to prevent disruption of the customs service and
                                consequent inevitable loss to foreign bondholders the customs be
                                placed under international control. Inspector General points to the
                                1912 arrangement under which control was placed temporarily in the
                                hands of the Inspector General and states that adoption of that plan
                                or of the suggestion of the Tientsin Commissioner for International
                                Control is a matter for the foreign powers to decide in
                                collaboration with the Chinese Government and he asks that the
                                matter be made known to our governments and their views
                                obtained.</item>

                            <item>I report the matter as requested but consider it would be futile
                                to attempt to induce China and Japan to agree to any scheme of
                                international control of the customs or to reintroduce the
                                arrangement of 1912. The Japanese military are determined to obtain
                                customs revenues for use in areas under their control and apparently
                                regard the release of foreign loan quotas as a liberal concession to
                                foreign interests. <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0645"/>The
                                customs situation is moving rapidly to a crisis. I believe the full
                                weight of foreign effort should be devoted to obtaining from the
                                Japanese Government at Tokyo broad assurances similar to those being
                                sought by the United States. The interest here seems to be in
                                opposing the use of Japanese instead of British banks of deposit for
                                the customs revenues collected at Japanese occupied ports. It is
                                also evident that foreign customs officials are principally
                                concerned as to their own future.</item>

                        <p>72. Shanghai’s 166, January 28, 9 p.m. MacKillop of British Embassy
                            informs me Moreno [<hi rend="italic">that he?</hi>] saw Kung on February
                            1 and recommended to him acceptance of Maze’s recommendation that 1931
                            tariff as amended be put into effect in the interest of uniformity of
                            tariff. Kung told MacKillop that he would give matter further
                            consideration after receiving views of British Government upon following
                            four points: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Chinese Government would have no
                            assurance that Japanese would permit 1931 tariff to be applied in North
                            China. Japanese on contrary might extend to Shanghai and other occupied
                            areas schedule now applied in North China. (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                            Chinese Government by this action might be drawn into undignified
                            competition with puppet governments in reduction of rates, (<hi
                                rend="italic">c</hi>) Lower rates would diminish securities for loan
                            obligations and increase burden of Central Government which is already
                            making up deficiency of revenue of customs. It is understood that
                            present customs revenue just about equals service of foreign loans and
                            cost of administration, (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Lower rates would
                            stimulate imports and increase strain on national currency by creating
                            demand for foreign exchange.</p>
                        <p>MacKillop states that his conversation with Kung took place before

                            were necessary in order to finance new Chinese regime. It is MacKillop’s

                        <p>I had a conversation yesterday with Arthur Young<note n="48"
                                xml:id="d662fn48">American adviser to the Chinese Ministry of

                            against deposit of customs funds in Japanese bank, and that he has
                            recommended against adoption 1931 tariff as recommended by Maze. Young
                            states that question is whether Japanese will take over customs or not,
                            and that suggested measures will not in the end affect Japanese decision
                            but may prejudice Chinese position vis-à-vis Japanese taking over of
                            customs.</p>

                        <p>Naval landing parties from a force of nine Japanese naval vessels are
                            completing occupation of Chefoo. Japanese have hoisted Japanese flag
                            over all Chinese public buildings. Commissioner of Customs intends to
                            protest against raising of Japanese flag over Chinese customs on grounds
                            of international interest in customs and customs revenue. I do not
                            believe that Japanese action constitutes an infringement of American
                            rights in customs integrity and customs revenue which would warrant a
                            protest from me at this time. Posters distributed by Japanese forces
                            show five barred flag and bear Chinese characters “Republic reborn
                            Peking”.</p>

                        <p>85. Shanghai’s 179, February 1, 9 p.m. The British Embassy states that a
                            protest will be made to the Japanese Consul General at Tientsin and that
                            an officer of the Embassy on January 31 called on the Japanese Counselor
                            in Peiping and made representations on the subject. The original Foreign
                            Office instructions were to protest to the Provisional Government in
                            Peiping but the British Counselor at Hankow directed that a call be made
                            on the Japanese Embassy instead. The local office of the British Embassy
                            is not hopeful that the Japanese will yield in their position on the
                            customs.</p>

                        <p>197. Japanese Consul General recently urged the Inspector General of
                            Customs to instruct the Shanghai Commissioner to deposit the Shanghai
                            revenues in the Yokohama Specie Bank. Inspector General <pb n="645"
                                xml:id="pg_645" facs="0649"/>replied that the customs revenues are
                            largely mortgaged for service of foreign obligations, that Japan is not
                            the only power interested, that a group of powers oppose deposit of
                            their shares in the Japanese Bank, that the Chinese Government also
                            objects, and that it is impossible for him to conclude an arrangement
                            with one power to which other powers object and the Japanese should
                            therefore endeavor to obtain withdrawal of that objection.</p>
                        <p>2. Japanese Consul General inquired of me this morning whether the
                            American Government object to deposit of revenue in the Japanese Bank. I
                            answered that the natural reply to his question is to inquire what
                            assurances the Japanese Government is prepared to give in response to
                            the request of the American Government as made at Tokyo and repeated by
                            me to him here. He admitted that he did not know the attitude of his
                            Government on the American request, commented that some of the
                            assurances would be difficult to give, but asserted that the Japanese
                            are prepared to release foreign loan and indemnity quotas. In the long
                            discussion which followed I suggested that it would seem a reasonable
                            compromise to release the foreign loan and indemnity quotas in other
                            than the Japanese Bank since he asserts that such quotas will be
                            released, but I emphasized that from my point of view the question of
                            the assurances we desire is much more important than the question of the
                            nationality of the bank of deposit. I also directed attention to reports
                            that the Japanese are not contributing to the customs revenues, their
                            ships and merchants not paying tariffs and customs duties. He replied
                            that he was anxious to get the matter of the Shanghai customs settled so
                            that this situation could be corrected.</p>

                            Following is paraphrase of telegraphic instruction sent by the Minister
                            of Finance to the Inspector General of Customs February 2: <quote

                                    may be expressed by the foreign governments, but in the meantime
                                    for your guidance and information it makes the following
                                    comment: Depositing customs’ funds in the Yokohama Specie Bank
                                    would be tantamount to delivering them to the Japanese, as shown
                                    by what has occurred at Tientsin and elsewhere. Moreover, the
                                    Japanese have indicated that over and above such sums as they
                                    themselves choose to make available for foreign obligations they
                                    would seize such funds, and there further is indication in the
                                    statement recently made by General Matsui that the Japanese
                                    would make adjustment of negotiations and would thereafter
                                    reduce even payments whose amount is specified under individual
                                    agreements and are thus not open to dispute. If the demands of
                                    the Japanese were accepted they would force the payments to
                                    themselves or to a bogus régime of most of the revenue collected
                                    by the customs which would be an invidious position. The result
                                    would be impairment of the credit of the Government and of the
                                    rights of bondholders both of which the Government in spite of
                                    great difficulties is trying to maintain.”</p>

                        <p>84. Kung left by air for Hong Kong today. He has summoned Maze to meet
                            him in Hong Kong. Arthur Young proceeds Hong Kong tomorrow. It is
                            expected that customs matter will be discussed. Young is advising Kung
                            against compromise on the ground that compromise begs the issue which is
                            “will Japanese take customhouses and administration by force?” He
                            believes Kung should instruct Commissioners of Customs to refuse to
                            collect new tariffs established by Japanese fostered régimes, or to
                            deposit collections with Yokohama Specie Bank at behest of Japanese,
                            lest Chinese discover that they have transferred customs to Japanese or
                            to regimes fostered by them.</p>

                            The Department does not wish to proffer views in regard to the suggested
                            reintroduction of the 1931 tariff or in regard to different rates for
                            specific items in that tariff and you may so inform the Inspector
                            General. You may also inform him of our very real interest in the
                            customs issue and of our hope that there may be reached a solution
                            which, insofar as practicable, will preserve the present customs
                            administrative machinery and procedure and make adequate provision for
                            the servicing of foreign loan and indemnity quotas.</p>

                            <item>My British colleague informs me that he is willing to make to the
                                Japanese Government an approach along the lines of pressing for the
                                assurances with regard to the customs at Shanghai which the American
                                Government has already requested. He feels, however, that we should
                                when making those representations express disapproval of the
                                arrangement which the Japanese have proposed. He points out that the
                                Japanese have already given oral assurances that foreign rights and
                                interests in the customs would be respected but that in fact the
                                arrangement which they are pressing the Commissioner of Customs to
                                accept violates that assurance. Craigie is informed from Shanghai
                                that there has been a substantial decrease in revenues and that the
                                Japanese desire, notwithstanding the fact that the foreign <pb
                                    n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0654"/>loans and indemnity quotas
                                should be the first charge on the revenues, to decrease these quotas
                                    <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with the decrease in revenue.
                                He believes that we could quite properly say to the Japanese that
                                the arrangements relating to the service of the foreign debts and
                                indemnities can only be modified by the Japanese Government (as by
                                the Chinese Government) with the assent of the powers which have
                                acquired rights in this matter in virtue of past agreements.</item>

                            <item>It seems to us that Craigie’s point is well taken. If the
                                Department shares that view, will it be disposed to authorize
                                modification of the suggested line of approach so as to include
                                disapproval of the proposed Japanese arrangement?</item>

                        <p>223. Japanese Consul General today sent a letter to the Commissioner of
                            Customs asking him to arrange to deposit customs revenues in the
                            Yokohama Specie Bank and stating that “the Japanese authorities will not
                            allow any amount of money to be transferred without” their authorization
                            from revenue accounts now in other banks except funds for defraying the
                            Shanghai customs expenses. The letter, which is in poor English, then
                            goes on to say that the Japanese authorities have no intention of having
                            withheld from foreign loan and indemnity services such payments from the
                            revenue accounts which they, the Japanese authorities, agree are
                            reasonably allotted from the Shanghai customs. The letter as interpreted
                            or explained by the Consul General’s representative does not preclude
                            withdrawal of funds for foreign loan and indemnity services from
                            revenues now in the British bank but makes such withdrawal subject to
                            authorization by the Japanese authorities who will consider whether it
                            represents a reasonable allotment from the Shanghai revenue.</p>

                                xml:id="pg_652" facs="0656"/>present banking account of the Shanghai
                            customs. I stated I would report to the Department for instructions.
                            British Chargé d’Affaires told us that his Government is insistent that
                            no customs revenues shall be placed in the Yokohama Specie Bank and that
                            his Government is seeking agreement to this position at Washington and
                            Paris. French Ambassador expressed the opinion that if the desired
                            assurances are given at Tokyo it might be possible to make an
                            arrangement under which revenues could be deposited in the Japanese
                            bank. With all due respect for the British view, I feel that I should
                            say to the Department that the situation appears to be heading rapidly
                            toward the point where the Japanese will take steps to compel deposit of
                            the revenues in the Japanese bank and we shall find them there without
                            any assurances or guarantees.</p>

                                Foreign Affairs before a committee of the Diet which appeared in the

                                    <p>“Reverting to the Shanghai situation the Foreign Minister
                                        said in answer to other questions ‘negotiations on customs
                                        are now in a deadlock. The position of this country is that
                                        a close watch should be kept on customs revenue rather than
                                        actually taking over the whole revenue. What revenue is
                                        taken will be deposited with the Specie Bank. In answer to
                                        the question whether the Government has any plan of using
                                        Shanghai customs revenue for reconstruction of the city I
                                        can say only that there is at present a great decline in
                                        revenue, due to the military campaign. This causes me to
                                        believe that the customs revenue cannot be used at least to
                                        any satisfactory degrees in reconstructing Shanghai.’”</p>

                            <item>Regarding point 3 the British Ambassador in a conversation with
                                Mr. Horinouchi on February 7 pointed out that Japan having
                                temporarily taken over at certain Chinese ports the rights of the
                                National Government in respect of the Chinese customs should in
                                equity also assume the obligations of that Government and that so
                                far as China’s obligations to foreign powers are concerned Japan has
                                promised to respect all foreign rights and interests in China. On
                                the foregoing basis Japan should recognize that the service of the
                                foreign debt and indemnities constitute a first charge on the
                                customs revenue apart from normal deductions for running expenses
                                and that therefore Japan should recognize that the arrangements
                                relating to the service of the foreign debt can only be modified by
                                the Japanese Government with the assent of the powers which have
                                acquired rights by virtue of past agreements. Craigie informs us
                                that although Horinouchi was prepared to agree that Japan had
                                assumed obligations in respect of customs quota of the Chinese
                                Government he would not agree that Japan should previously discuss
                                with other governments any proposed change in quota. Craigie states
                                that he gathered from Horinouchi’s evasive reply that the Japanese
                                authorities in Shanghai intended to use the customs revenues to
                                service other administrations as well as the Customs Administration
                                before the loans were serviced.</item>

                            <item>Craigie told me today that he considers the customs situation
                                critical and hopes that I will be in a position to act in concert
                                with himself and the French Ambassador as soon as possible. My
                                French colleague is prepared to act as soon as my own instructions
                                are received.</item>

                            from a monthly average of about 34 million Chinese dollars during the
                            first 7 months of last year to slightly more than 14½ million monthly
                            average during last 5 months of the year. Estimated revenue for January
                            this year 15½ million. Whereas Shanghai formerly contributed about 45%
                            of the total revenue, it now contributes about 25%. Cost of customs
                            administration is roughly 40 million dollars a year. Total payments due
                            from customs revenue in 1938 in respect of obligations with regard to
                            service as of July 1st, 1937, estimated to be the equivalent of 88
                            million Chinese dollars for foreign loans and indemnities and 130
                            million for internal debt.</p>

                            of the Tientsin customs to remit funds for foreign loan and indemnity
                            service was due to a decision made by the Customs Commissioner at
                            Tientsin led to inquiry as a result of which the British Chargé
                            d’Affaires has obtained and sent to me and to the French Ambassador in
                            strict confidence copy of a letter dated October 22 addressed by the
                            Commissioner of Customs at Tientsin to the Japanese Consul General there

                        <p>134. Your 235, February 10, 7 p.m. Should the Inspector General of
                            Customs communicate to you the letter outlined in your telegram No. 223,
                            February 8, 6 p.m., the Department desires that, if such communication
                            calls for any response beyond an acknowledgment, you reply that the
                            American Government does not wish to advise the Chinese Maritime Customs
                            administration in regard to the attitude which it should adopt in the
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>For your information and guidance, the Department gives below the
                            substance of an <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> which it is handing
                            to the British Embassy here<note n="62" xml:id="d684fn62">The
                                Department’s <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of February 13 was
                                in reply to the British Embassy’s inquiry of February 9; neither
                                printed.</note> in response to the latter’s question whether the
                            United States Government would support a proposal to the Japanese and
                            Chinese Governments that customs funds in areas controlled by the
                            Japanese be deposited in the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation
                            and that control of those funds be vested in a body of officials
                            nominated by the interested powers.</p>
                        <p>The Department replied that it would not be in position to take the
                            proposed action but, realizing that the British Government might wish to
                            continue with the proposal, desired to avoid any procedure that would
                            tend to prejudice the British position. The Department stated that it
                            was accordingly instructing the American Ambassador to Japan and you to
                            consult with your British colleagues and, if the latter so desired, to

                            authorities; that Mr. Grew and you were being further instructed that in

                            Government with the fact that you have information in regard to the
                            character of the Japanese proposal made to the Commissioner of Customs
                            at Shanghai for a settlement of the Customs problem; to refer to the
                            assurances which the American Government has already requested of the
                            Japanese Government; and to re-express an earnest and emphatic desire to
                            receive from the Japanese Government positive assurances that no action
                            will be taken or countenanced that will disrupt the Chinese Customs
                            service or jeopardize the servicing of foreign obligations secured on
                            the Customs revenues and that the servicing of such obligations will be
                            considered and treated as first charges on the Customs revenue after the
                            deduction of the costs of maintaining the Chinese Maritime Customs.</p>
                        <p>The French Embassy here has informally approached the Department in
                            regard to this subject, and you and Tokyo may acquaint your French
                            colleagues with the Department’s position as set forth in this and
                            previous telegrams.</p>

                            Inspector General of Customs by the Minister of Finance that he is to
                            instruct Commissioners of Customs in occupied territory to decline to
                            apply new tariff recently proclaimed for application in such areas, on
                            the ground that Chinese customs service is entrusted with responsible
                            duty of enforcing a uniform tariff at all parts of China in accordance
                            with China’s treaty obligations, and of remitting revenues to the
                            Inspector General for the purpose of meeting obligations for which
                            revenues are pledged. Commissioners of Customs are also instructed to
                            notify the public that payment of new tariff is not recognized by the

                                would thereby leave the way open for the Japanese to scale down loan

                                xml:id="pg_658" facs="0662"/>support the British plan rather than to
                            seek further assurances along the lines we propose to follow,” that this
                            Government considers that the British plan, even if this Government were
                            wholeheartedly to “support” it, would be rejected by the Japanese; that
                            the British plan involves insistence upon one or more measures to which
                            this Government believes that the Japanese Government will not under the
                            existing circumstances assent; and that the procedure which this
                            Government suggests and which it is prepared to follow is one
                            calculated, in this Government’s opinion, to stand a fair chance of
                            gaining the assent of the Japanese. Say that this Government, on the
                            basis of your views and the views of the American Consul General at
                            Shanghai and the views of the Department, all of which are in
                            substantial agreement, believes it advisable to concentrate on the
                            points most to be desired, especially the maintenance of the integrity
                            of the Customs Administration. Say that, in case the “whole thing” or
                            any part of it is “lost”, the factors responsible for that eventuation
                            will be numerous; and that among those factors, absence of this
                            Government’s “backing of the British view” will in our opinion have had
                            less of contributory effect than will refusal of the British to respond
                            to any other than the British view.</p>
                        <p>The Department desires that you hold in abeyance the approach to the
                            Japanese Government authorized in the Department’s 37, February 3, 9

                        <p>263. Reference my 235, February 10, 7 p.m. regarding Shanghai customs.
                            Inspector General has today informed the Commissioner of Customs that he
                            understands conversations are proceeding in Tokyo between interested
                            diplomatic representatives and Japanese Government regarding the
                            question of bank of deposit of customs revenue, that Inspector General
                            is not in a position to take action himself or to authorize the
                            Commissioner to do so, that it is not possible for him to conclude an
                            agreement with one power which is not acceptable to other powers whose
                            interest in indemnities and loans on the customs exceed those of Japan,
                            and he suggests therefore that the matter be deferred pending conclusion
                            of negotiations at Tokyo. Commissioner <pb n="659" xml:id="pg_659"

                        <p>309. I discussed the customs situation yesterday afternoon with the
                            Japanese Consul General who says he has received no instructions in
                            regard to the assurances we desire and that any such assurances must, of
                            course, be given at Tokyo. He suggested that customs revenues in
                            Japanese occupied ports be deposited in the Japanese bank while those in
                            Chinese ports be placed in the British bank, and that the interested
                            foreign representatives should now determine the quotas due from each
                            port for service of foreign obligations, saying that it can also be
                            arranged to release quotas from other Japanese occupied ports. He
                            desires that quotas be fixed for a year and that they be based upon
                            revenues for the past 5 or 6 months. I pointed out that if the
                            assurances we desire are given and implemented in good faith it will be
                            a simple routine process for the Inspectorate General to determine
                            monthly or every 2 months what amounts are due from each port for
                            servicing loan obligations. I again complained of the extremely
                            unsatisfactory situation here under which the customs are restricted in
                            functioning and Japanese ships and Japanese merchants are not paying
                            tonnage dues and customs duties. I also stated that reports indicate
                            continued smuggling in North China. He asserted that smuggling in the
                            north has been stopped and he is anxious to settle the customs question
                            here and suppress irregular practices.</p>

                        <p>2. It seems to me obvious that what the Japanese now desire is to obtain
                            for their own purposes of customs revenues over and above the lowest
                            possible fixed quotas for customs expenses and foreign obligations,
                            leaving all other questions to be dealt with in future by the puppet
                            governments of their creation.</p>

                        <p>124. My 117, February 21, 3 p.m. I am authoritatively informed that Kung,
                            replying to British Ambassador’s advice, has stated in substance as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Chinese Government considers that Japanese interference with
                                    performance of China’s treaty and loan agreement
                                    obligations—introduction of new tariff, seizure of customs
                                    revenue and application of pressure to make Customs
                                    Administration subservient to Japanese wishes—should appear as
                                    acts of violence and not as compliance by Chinese customs
                                    officials as tools of the Japanese. Chinese Government asks
                                    British Government what action it would be prepared to take that
                                    might be effective in avoiding a serious eventuality which
                                    Chinese Government believes will result from a policy of
                                    acquiescence in Japanese wishes on the part of customs
                                    services.</p>
                                <p>In view of British suggestions of disobedience by Commissioners,
                                    Chinese Government asks British Government to emphasize to any
                                    person or persons of British nationality disobedience of orders
                                    issued by lawful Chinese authority with a view to maintenance of
                                    China’s treaty and loan obligations would involve disloyalty of
                                    high traditions of service and would be particularly
                                    reprehensible at this particular juncture. Chinese Government
                                    asks British Government to bring all practicable pressure to
                                    bear, with a view to prevention of disloyalty which would have
                                    unfortunate consequences for British and other foreign as well
                                    as Chinese interests.”</p>

                            has given me in confidence the substance of new telegraphic instructions
                            from his Foreign Office dated February 24 paraphrased below which he
                            will take up tomorrow with the Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>

                        <p>Without indicating that he has given me this document for any reason
                            other than to keep me informed of developments he evidently hopes that
                            these modified proposals may commend themselves to and possibly receive
                            the support of our own Government. He tells me that the French
                            Ambassador is prepared to make representations in support of these
                            proposals but Craigie has asked him to abstain from doing so lest the
                            impression be created that the American Government alone is out of
                            sympathy with the British position which would inevitably weaken his own
                            representations.</p>

                                concession. We believe that if possible this concession should be
                                restricted to depositing in the Yokohama Specie Bank the Japanese
                                share in the loan services as well as the surplus after the foreign

                                <item>(6) In addition to the above it is highly desirable to have a

                            situation:</p>
                        <p>Arthur Young states that in October there was discussion in Shanghai
                            regarding instructions which should be sent to Commissioner of Customs
                            at Tientsin in connection with discussions emanating from Tientsin as
                            the result of instructions sent to the Commissioner quoted in my 804,
                            October 13, 3 p.m.<note n="71" xml:id="d696fn71"><ref

                                    873</ref>.</note> Young states that on October 15 British
                            Consul, Tientsin, reported that strong objection was taken by Japanese
                            authorities to the fact that arrangements for <pb n="664"
                                xml:id="pg_664" facs="0668"/>custodian bank covered all China and
                            Consul doubted whether even the original proposal of putting the money
                            into Yokohama Specie Bank would be acceptable. Maze appears to have
                            suggested in view of the above that only safe way to ensure agreement
                            would be to authorize the Commissioner to make the best local settlement
                            of the case. Kung would not agree to this. Eventually, as the result of
                            discussions in Shanghai between Kung, Hall-Patch, Hall<note n="72"
                                xml:id="d696fn72">Monroe B. Hall, Consul at Shanghai.</note> and
                            Young, Maze instructed Commissioner at Tientsin on October 19 that
                            Minister of Finance was unable to authorize any concession beyond that
                            set out in the six points which Department will find covered in my 804,
                            October 13, 3 p.m. This instruction was followed by another on October
                            19 sent by Maze to the Commissioner of Customs at Tientsin which
                            apparently had the approval of Kung. It stated that if Commissioner of
                            Customs [at] Tientsin failed to secure agreement along lines of six
                            points and in view of the difficult position in which he was,
                            Commissioner of Customs was privately authorized as a final alternative
                            to use his discretion in depositing the Tientsin and Chinwangtao customs
                            revenue locally “in a reliable bank of good standing, but remittances
                            for cost of collection, foreign and internal loans, and the indemnity
                            and regular local obligations such as conservancy and quantity are to be
                            made therefrom as due and if considered necessary by you. Any balance
                            remaining is to be left to accumulate in the bank.” Arthur Young informs
                            me that the “due and if” in the above quotation were omitted in the
                            process of transmitting this instruction to Commissioner of Customs at
                            Tientsin, and that Commissioner therefore interpreted message as giving
                            him complete discretion. He deposited funds in the Yokohama Specie Bank
                            without obtaining any assurances from the Japanese, hence situation
                            which has now developed. Letter dated October 22 addressed by the
                            Commissioner of Customs at Tientsin to the Japanese Consul General,
                            quoted in Shanghai’s 252, February 12, 8 p.m., was doubtless the result
                            of Commissioner of Customs’ exercise of discretion which he thought he
                            had because of the instruction which he received from the Chinese
                            representative and which was dated October 19.</p>

                        <p>340. On January 28th the National City Bank reported the customs
                            authorities here had refused to issue a permit to reship a cargo of <pb
                                n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0669"/>automobile tires from Shanghai
                            to Hong Kong and that it was their understanding such refusal was based
                            upon instructions issued by the Japanese military authorities to the
                            customs to prevent shipment from Shanghai of any so-called war materials
                            which might reach the Chinese market. Another American firm a few days
                            later reported a similar case involving a shipment of tires to
                            Hoihow.</p>
                        <p>These cases were immediately taken up with the Commissioner of Customs
                            who on February 1st replied in part as follows: “The Japanese
                            authorities who are now in military control of this area have informed
                            me that they cannot allow reshipment of tires to Hong Kong or to South
                            China ports”.</p>
                        <p>On February 2 I addressed a letter to the Japanese Consul General
                            regarding the matter and requested an explanation of this reported
                            interference by the Japanese authorities with legitimate American trade.
                            On February 18th a further request was made for an immediate reply. I am
                            now in receipt of the Japanese Consul General’s reply dated February
                            28th the pertinent portions of which read as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I have the honor to inform you in reply that upon the complete
                                    encirclement of Shanghai by the Japanese forces the Japanese
                                    military authorities instructed the Shanghai Maritime Customs to
                                    prohibit the reshipment from Shanghai of military supplies which
                                    are liable to fall into the hands of the Chinese troops or being
                                    utilized by the Chinese for military purposes. Since the
                                    reshipment of the goods belonging to the said American firms has
                                    been prohibited by the Shanghai Maritime Customs in accordance
                                    with the instructions of the Japanese military authorities, I
                                    regret to inform you that I am not in a position to enable the
                                    said goods to be reshipped from Shanghai to South China or Hong
                                    Kong. I have to add however that the Japanese authorities have
                                    no intention whatever to impede legitimate and bona fide
                                    business transactions by nationals of third powers and therefore
                                    are now trying to devise such means as to preclude as far as
                                    possible any unnecessary pressure on legitimate business
                                    transactions resulting from the application of the said
                                    prohibition.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>A few cases involving goods other than tires have been reported but upon
                            representations being made to the Commissioner of Customs permits to
                            reship have generally been granted which would seem to indicate that
                            while the prohibition in respect of tires is absolute there is
                            considerable elasticity in regard to other goods. In this connection I
                            learn from the acting British Commercial Counselor that British firms
                            have experienced somewhat similar difficulties but that no shipments of
                            tires have been involved, that all cases of other types of goods have
                            been successfully arranged with the customs and that in consequence it
                            has not been necessary thus far to make any representations to the
                            Japanese authorities.</p>

                            the Government of China as the only authority which can legally cause a

                            memorandum outlining the very serious effect upon the Salt
                            Administration and upon the system of regular monthly remittances of
                            revenues for the unprotected foreign loans in particular resulting from
                            hostilities and Japanese military occupation of certain districts.</p>

                                Director at Tientsin, a Japanese subject, participated apparently
                                under compulsion in the seizure of the records and in the subsequent

                                and as such has appointed a fellow Japanese until recently at Amoy

                                withdrew some time ago to Hong Kong and has been ordered to proceed
                                to Hankow and Chungking. Lockhart remains at Shanghai temporarily in
                                connection with foreign loan interests principally. The attitude of
                                the Ministry of Finance appears to be one of desiring the withdrawal
                                of the Administration from occupied areas to prevent development of
                                organization and revenue by the Japanese. This would more or less
                                tie Lockhart’s hands in any negotiations with the Japanese should
                                they become necessary. He has not been approached by Japanese. There
                                are reports that the special service bureau of the Japanese Army or
                                its puppet governments will set up a salt bureau for Kiangsu,

                        <p>151. My 124, February 25, 4 p.m. Doctor Young showed me yesterday a copy
                            of a letter addressed to Doctor Kung by Mr. MacKillop of British Embassy
                            which contained in substance the following:</p>
                        <p>British note stated that policy which Kung suggested must lead to the
                            forcible seizure and disruption of the customs by the Japanese; that
                            this will result in the suspension of service of foreign obligations and
                            destroy China’s credit. British note states that the only means of
                            avoiding Japanese control of customs in occupied areas (which Japanese
                            are in a position to do) is to arrive at some arrangement which will
                            preserve non-Japanese administration, provide due service of foreign
                            obligations, and enable collections to be enforced. British note added
                            that the object of the discussions at Tokyo and Shanghai is to secure as
                            far as possible these essentials, and stated that it was the desire of
                            the British Government that the utmost effort should be made to persuade
                            Doctor Kung to acquiesce in any arrangements that it might be possible
                            to reach in those negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Doctor Young remarked to me that British Government was asking Kung to
                            accept some arrangement which might be arrived at through negotiations
                            concerning which Doctor Kung was being kept in complete ignorance.</p>

                        <p>154. Shanghai’s 371, March 9, 4 p.m. It is my opinion that in dealing
                            with the situation which faces the Salt Administration we should remain
                            as aloof in the matter of offering advice to the Chinese as we have been
                            in regard to the Customs Administration. Chinese Government is unable to
                            do anything for administration of this tax in areas occupied by the
                            Japanese. Foreign governments are in no position to substitute
                            themselves individually or in combination for Chinese control. Japanese
                            are prepared and in fact desire to substitute Japanese control for
                            Chinese control of these taxes. Under the circumstances it seems to me
                            that we must in the end hold Japanese responsible for any claim which
                            our nationals have upon the revenues in question.</p>

                                    American share of the Hukuang Loan, the so-called Chicago Bank
                                    Loan, and the Pacific Development Corporation Loan); (2) that
                                    arrangements were made early in 1937 for the servicing of those
                                    loans from salt revenues, with every prospect that payment would

                                    servicing those loans are being adversely affected in
                                    consequence of the action in China of Japanese armed forces, we

                        <p>451. Following from Tokyo:</p>
                        <p>198. “March 24, 8 p.m. The British Ambassador called this morning and
                            informed me that his negotiations with the Japanese Government with
                            respect to the settlement of the Chinese customs question were coming to
                            a close. He furnished me with a copy of the text of a proposed agreement
                            which he has telegraphed to Ms Government. He believes the proposed
                            agreement, which the Japanese would like to put into force from April
                            1st next, represents the maximum concession obtainable from the Japanese
                            and that it will be generally satisfactory to the British Government
                            although there are two or three points which may require modification.
                            The Ambassador stated that he believed the agreement would be
                            satisfactory to the Chinese in view of the fact that the Japanese were
                            agreeing to the full servicing of the foreign loans and thereby helping
                            to maintain China’s credit and furthermore that the arrears on the
                            foreign loan and indemnity service at present deposited in the Hong Kong
                            and Shanghai Bank would be released to meet the relevant overdraft of
                            the Central Bank of China for the loan and indemnity payments for which
                            they act as security.</p>
                        <p>The French Ambassador has cabled the text to his Government and asked for
                            instructions.</p>
                        <p>Craigie expressed the hope that the settlement of the customs question by
                            the proposed agreement would prevent the Chinese from further playing of
                            the American, British, and French Governments against Japan. Craigie
                            then stated that he hoped that if we could not accept or approve the
                            proposed agreement our Government would at least express no objection to
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The proposed agreement presumably is to be initialed by Craigie and the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs and despatched to Shanghai to be signed by
                            the Inspector General of Customs and the Japanese Consul General at
                            Shanghai.</p>

                        <p>The following is a paraphrase of Craigie’s telegram to his Government
                            commenting on the proposed agreement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>‘The arrangement proposed represents the best I can hope to get
                                    here and, while we need not take too seriously Vice Minister’s
                                    warning in regard to impatience of local authorities, I am
                                    definitely of opinion that further bargaining now over details
                                    will only play into hands of opponents of any arrangement with
                                    foreign interests.</p>
                                <p>Under proposed arrangement we secure return to central bank of
                                    Shanghai arrears on foreign loan quotas (£6,700,000) and
                                    creation of reserve fund in addition to reserve fund for
                                    northern area. It is useless to press further for any control
                                    over surplus balances whether of arrears or of future
                                    collections, but arrangement contains no mention of how surplus
                                    is to be disposed of after deposit in Yokohama [Specie] Bank and
                                    we remain free to continue unofficial pressure on behalf of
                                    domestic loan service. I have proposed deposit of surplus in
                                    name of Inspector General (see Shanghai telegram to Foreign
                                    Office No. 482) but I do not think Japanese Government will
                                    agree. Vice Minister hopes that new currency in North China will
                                    be placed on a convertible basis before arrangement is
                                    concluded, but agrees that, failing that, a clause must be added
                                    to ensure that northern revenues are made available to the
                                    Inspector General either in Chinese legal tender or in foreign
                                    currencies necessary to these obligations.</p>
                                <p>I hope to receive simultaneously desired assurances as regards
                                    Japanese non-military imports and customs launches, except that
                                    latter must at present be confined to ports in occupied area. I
                                    am hopeful however we may gradually be able to secure release of
                                    some launches for operation off coasts of unoccupied area.
                                    Decision on 1931 tariff still hangs fire and I do not anticipate
                                    answer before end of month: but omens are favorable and I do not
                                    recommend insistence on obtaining parallel assurance on this
                                    point.</p>
                                <p>It is just possible that, after discussions with financial
                                    adviser, we may still be able to get monthly basis of
                                    calculation of quotas in return for abandonment of all claim to
                                    creation of reserve funds, but I am not sanguine of this nor am
                                    I convinced that it is wise policy.</p>
                                <p>Subject to any amendments which financial adviser may propose on
                                    points as to detail, I hope I may have your authority to agree
                                    to <pb n="674" xml:id="pg_674" facs="0678"/>proposed arrangement
                                    before the end of this month. It will, I presume, ultimately
                                    take the form of an agreement between Inspector General of
                                    Customs and Japanese Consul General at Shanghai, but I should be

                        <p>I have now been informed by one of the American firms affected by this

                            lots not exceeding 50 pieces have been passed by the customs and shipped
                            to South China ports. Shipment of larger lots apparently still
                            impossible. From a reliable customs source I learn that although there
                            has been no change in the general prohibitory order issued by the
                            Japanese military referred to above, Japanese customs authorities are

                            Under date of March 22 British Embassy addressed letter to Kung
                            referring to memorandum of the Associate Director General of the Salt
                            Administration stating that the question of representations to the
                            Japanese Government was under consideration. British Embassy stated that
                            the basis of such representations would be that “apart from the
                            interests of His Majesty’s Government in existing loans secured on salt
                            revenues and in the British staff, the preservation of the
                            Administration is most important for future rehabilitation.” British
                            Embassy concluded by stating that under the circumstances British
                            Embassy was anxious to urge upon Kung the importance of <pb n="675"

                            March 24: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Chinese Government is anxious that every practicable step be
                                    taken to preserve the Salt Administration and to prevent its
                                    disruption, and will be grateful for the assistance of your
                                    Government to that end. As to the position of the:
                                    foreign-officers, I would point out that the present abnormal
                                    conditions, and particularly difficulties of communication, have
                                    made it impracticable in all cases fully to maintain the
                                    principles by whatever joint responsibility of foreign and
                                    Chinese officers in matter of administration; but in principle I
                                    consider that as to essential functions the joint responsibility
                                    of the Directors General and of the subordinate foreign and
                                    Chinese officials should be maintained substantially as it
                                    existed during the years prior to the outbreak of hostilities. I

                        <p>178. Shanghai’s 451, March 25, noon. I have not observed anything in the
                            situation here which would lead me to expect that the proposed agreement
                            regarding Chinese customs worked out between British Ambassador and
                            Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs will be accepted by Chinese
                            Government. As was to have been expected, agreement makes no provision
                            for maintenance of domestic loans, nor any provision made regarding
                            surplus of funds after foreign quotas and administrative expenses of
                            customs have been taken care of. My reaction to this proposal is that we
                            should refrain from urging Chinese Government to accept this
                            arrangement. I see no reason on the other hand why we should attempt to
                            oppose it.</p>
                        <p>I do not perceive any basis for hope that the settlement of the customs
                            question by this proposed agreement would prevent Chinese from further
                            playing off the American, British and French Governments against Japan.
                            It has not been apparent to me that the Chinese Government has
                            endeavored to use this question for the purpose indicated. On the
                            contrary, it has at times seemed to me that the Japanese may be disposed
                            to use the situation for the purpose of persuading the British, French
                            and American Governments to use their influence with the Chinese
                            Government to accept situations beneficial to the <pb n="676"

                                    that the latter will not accept the responsibility of signing an

                                    therefore now visualizes the following procedure: The Japanese
                                    Government would convey to Craigie the assurances finally
                                    evolving from his negotiations and at the same time would send
                                    transcript of instructions to the Japanese Consular Officers in
                                    China who in turn would communicate these instructions involving
                                    the deposit of customs receipts in the Yokohama Specie Bank to
                                    the various Customs Commissioners. The Commissioners acting

                                    action to the Inspector General. Such procedure is apparently

                                    to the service of the foreign obligations shall be based.
                                    Namely, (1) quotas fixed for 6 months in advance on the basis of
                                    the receipts of the previous 6 months, together with reserve
                                    funds on which the Inspector General can call in order to make
                                    good any deficiencies and (2) a system of quotas revised monthly
                                    on the basis of collections for the preceding month but without
                                    any reserve funds. The draft text as revised is based on the
                                    assumption that the former alternative will be chosen.</p>

                                    regarding the Chinese customs revenues and states that the

                                    on the understanding that they are of a temporary nature and for
                                    duration of the present hostilities. The note concludes with the
                                    expression of hope that the arrangements will prove acceptable
                                    to the British Government.</p>
                                <p>Craigie’s draft reply acknowledges the receipt of the Foreign
                                    Minister’s note and states that the arrangements proposed in the
                                    documents enclosed therewith are acceptable to the British
                                    Government.</p>

                                    debt, the payment of duty on non-military imports at Shanghai,
                                    and the return of the customs craft seized by the Japanese

                                    states that while the question of China’s domestic debt lies

                                        facs="0682"/>relating to China’s foreign obligations it is
                                    believed that the Provisional Government will in its own
                                    interest give due consideration to this question. With regard to
                                    the payment of duty on non-military imports at Shanghai the
                                    draft letter states that it is unavoidable that the Chinese
                                    customs during active hostilities should have suffered some
                                    temporary dislocation in the ports immediately affected and that
                                    it is the intention of the Japanese Government that normal
                                    conditions should be restored and that payment of duty by [<hi
                                        rend="italic">on?</hi>] all Japanese imports should be
                                    ensured at the earliest possible date; and that if not possible
                                    it is hoped that interested third powers will appreciate the
                                    importance of such emergency measures as reduction or exemption
                                    of tariff on a limited number of articles urgently needed and
                                    indispensable for the restoration of devastated war areas and
                                    for the relief of the general population. With respect to the
                                    return of the customs craft the draft letter points out that the
                                    customs service has already been permitted to use some of the
                                    vessels and that the Chinese authorities in the areas under
                                    Japanese orbits will gradually become interested in ensuring the
                                    collection of customs revenues and the Japanese will be ready to
                                    cooperate to this end and in such circumstances the Chinese
                                    customs service will be permitted to use all [its?] vessels
                                    excepting those especially required for military purposes and
                                    that even the latter will be progressively released as
                                    circumstances permit.</p>

                            the British Ambassador has now reached agreement with the Vice Minister

                            arrangement consists of a note with enclosure from the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs and the British Ambassador’s reply. In addition there is
                            a confidential exchange of letters with the Vice Minister relating to
                            the provision of exchange to facilitate the transfer of the North China
                            quotas.</p>
                        <p>My British colleague has suggested that the texts be cabled to the
                            Department. He considers the matter urgent because if the arrangement is
                            not concluded soon it may not be possible to apply it to the March
                            customs collections which he feels would greatly complicate matters.</p>

                                    Chinese Maritime Customs, I should be glad if, in order to avoid
                                    future misunderstanding, Your Excellency would be so good as to
                                    give me an assurance that the quotas for foreign obligations
                                    payable by the northern ports in Japanese occupation will be
                                    remitted in a currency which will enable the Inspector General
                                    to effect the necessary transfer into the currencies in which
                                    the foreign obligations are serviced. This question arises
                                    particularly in connection with the recent decline [<hi

                                    authorities in China will lend such assistance as they properly
                                    can in overcoming transfer difficulties in connection with the

                            Chinese customs. Young yesterday handed my copy of a letter which he
                            addressed on April 25 to British Ambassador which referred to letter
                            summarized in my 151, March 10, 10 a.m., and made suggestion that
                            consideration be given to the danger that the Japanese authorities might
                            cause Japanese fostered regimes in China to accept any arrangement
                            regarding customs which might be agreed upon between one or more of the
                            friendly powers and Japan—before ascertaining whether conclusion of such
                            arrangement would be acceptable to China—and then represent that the
                            friendly powers had in effect recognized such regimes by reaching an
                            understanding with them regarding customs. Young urged the desirability
                            that Chinese Government be kept advised as far as deemed practicable and
                            be consulted before anything should be consummated between Great Britain
                            and Japan regarding customs. Young informs me that Chinese Government
                            has no information of negotiations in Tokyo other than oral summary
                            communicated to Kung by British Ambassador on recent visit.</p>

                        <p>217. My 215, April 26, 10 a.m. Arthur Young gave me on April 25th copy of
                            a confidential memorandum which he had presented on that day to British
                            Ambassador at the latter’s request regarding customs secured internal
                            loans issued prior to outbreak of hostilities. Memorandum states that
                            such loans outstanding amount to about 1,800 millions and that amount
                            required for their service in 1938 is about 130 millions; that the
                            corresponding figures for external customs secured obligations are
                            approximately 650 millions and 90 millions. He states that since
                            hostilities the service of foreign obligations has absorbed nearly all
                            the net customs revenue exclusive of sums seized by Japanese controlled
                            agencies at Tientsin and other ports, and that central bank has advanced
                            to the customs amounts required to make up shortage.</p>
                        <p>Memorandum points out that as a matter of legal right obligations for
                            which customs revenue is pledged are equally valid with rank according
                            to seniority, and that an arrangement prejudicing position of some
                            obligations by selecting others for favored treatment and permitting
                            diversion of revenue for purposes other than those for which revenue is
                            pledged would cause far-reaching injury to China’s credit. Memorandum
                            emphasizes importance of domestic loans to China’s financial structure,
                            pointing out that they are an essential part of the backing of the
                            currency and comprise practically all of the required 60% of the
                            fiduciary reserve against note issue. Memorandum was intended to impress
                            British with necessity of including domestic loans in matters being
                            considered in negotiations which British Ambassador has been conducting
                            in Tokyo.</p>
                        <p>I am personally persuaded that on or about May 1st Japanese Government
                            may attempt to arrange with Japanese controlled regimes at Nanking and
                            Peiping to put into effect agreement recently arrived at between British
                            and Japanese at Tokyo, and that British will find that customs in those
                            areas have for all practical purposes been handed over to only Chinese
                            authorities which Japanese recognize. Whether or not this result has
                            been contemplated by British in negotiations at Tokyo I do not know.
                            British Ambassador doubtless sincerely believes that he has been
                            discussing an arrangement which Japanese will accept as between them and
                            Nationalist Chinese authorities at Hankow, but I feel certain that
                            Japanese will not recognize Chinese <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683"

                            communicate it to regimes set up by them.</p>

                                authorities in China can properly render in overcoming transfer

                                obligations, Sir Robert said that during his negotiations with the
                                Vice Minister the latter had pressed for assurances that the British
                                authorities in China would use their influence to persuade the Bank
                                of Communications and the Bank of China to permit their Tientsin
                                branches to sell to the Yokohama Specie Bank in Tientsin bills
                                against their credit balances in order to provide the necessary yuan
                                exchange for the quotas of the governments in North China. Sir
                                Robert said that he could not agree to endeavor to persuade the
                                banks to act along the lines desired and that he finally agreed to
                                compromise on the understanding that the British authorities would
                                place the matter before those banks and leave it entirely to them
                                whether they could meet the desires of the Japanese.</p>
                            <p>Sir Robert then went on to say that he also had an understanding with
                                the Vice Minister, outside the agreement, to the effect that the
                                interest charges on the Tientsin–Pukow Railway loans and the
                                Hu-kuang Railway loan (both British) while not covered by the
                                proposed agreement nevertheless had a secondary lien on the customs
                                revenues. In the event the interest should not be forthcoming due to
                                restrictions against traffic on account of Japanese military
                                operations, the interest service was to be paid out of customs
                                revenues after the service had been paid on the loans constituting
                                the first charge on the customs revenues. He said that it was quite
                                likely that the interest service on the <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684"
                                    facs="0688"/>Tientsin–Pukow Railway would have to be paid out of
                                the customs revenues but it was not likely that the Hukuang Railway
                                loan service would come up before 1941. He said that in order to get
                                the Vice Minister to agree to this the Japanese required equal
                                treatment of the 6% Treasury notes issued for compensation for
                                public property and salt interests in Tsingtao in 1923 and the
                                Chinese Government 8% bonds for refunding interest and foreign
                                debt.</p>
                            <p>Sir Robert Craigie said that when putting up to his Government the
                                proposed agreement as it now stands he stressed the fact that the
                                conclusion of the agreement would be very helpful to all concerned
                                as there were two schools of thought in Japan: the one dominated by
                                the military whose tactics were to present a <hi rend="italic">fait
                                    accompli</hi>, and the other the civilian element who believed
                                that through negotiation and agreement much could be done in dealing
                                with the foreign powers to assure their good will and their
                                cooperation when and if needed and the agreement would tend to
                                demonstrate that the policy of the latter was by far the better one.

                        <p>260. 1. An officer of the Embassy has been informed by the Italian
                            Commissioner of Customs at Chinwangtao that the so-called situation in
                            that area has been “liquidated” through the payment made by customs to
                            persons unnamed (presumably Japanese military) of Chinese dollars 50,000
                            and that Chinwangtao and Shanhaikwan revenues together now approximate
                            Chinese dollars 400,000 monthly as against one fourth that sum when
                            smuggling was rife. According to the Commissioner, none of this revenue
                            goes to the Peiping régime but is deposited in and held by the Yokohama
                            Specie Bank.</p>
                        <p>2. The Commissioner states also that the Japanese now permit his officers
                            to carry arms and customs cruisers and wall stations to have machine
                            guns.</p>

                                ourselves might be preferable and hopes that this procedure will be
                                agreeable to our Government.</item>

                                Unless the American Government, which has a direct interest in the
                                integrity and disbursements of the Chinese Maritime Customs, states
                                to the Japanese Government that it does not propose to offer any
                                objection to the proposed arrangement, Craigie fears that the
                                Japanese Government may be reluctant to conclude the agreement. He
                                says there is now a real danger that, failing an early agreement,
                                the customs at Shanghai will be taken over forcibly by the
                                renovation government (which means the Japanese military

                            addressed to British Embassy by Minister of Finance in reference to
                            customs agreement negotiated by British Embassy at Tokyo. Letter
                            referred to Reuter report that agreement was to be initialed in Tokyo on
                            April 30 and copies would be sent to France, United States and other
                            interested powers. Letter then asks that British Embassy inquire by
                            telegraph as to basis for report, saying that in conversation with
                            British Ambassador here latter had not indicated that such an agreement
                            was imminent. Letter concludes by stating that as matter is chiefly of
                            concern to China, Minister of Finance assumes that Chinese Government
                            will be informed of proposed terms well in advance before understanding
                            is concluded in order to ascertain whether terms would be acceptable.
                            Letter states that pending receipt of information and full consideration
                            of all aspects of situation the position of the Chinese Government will
                            be fully reserved. British Embassy replied on April 29 that no agreement
                            had been made, but that a draft had been drawn up which was now being
                            considered in London.</p>

                            night: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“30th April 1938. Immediate. My Dear Grew, The Ministry for
                                    Foreign Affairs are anxious, for reasons connected with the
                                    Privy Council, not to publish the actual texts of the notes or
                                    their enclosure relating to the customs and we have accordingly
                                    prepared the accompanying draft of a communiqué, which, it is
                                    suggested, might be issued in the morning papers (here and in
                                    London) of the day following the conclusion of the arrangement.
                                    This text I have now submitted to my Government. The inclusion
                                    of the last sentence of paragraph 1 is of course dependent on
                                    your receiving the necessary authority to inform the Japanese
                                    Government that your Government do not propose to raise any
                                    objection to these arrangements. We have discovered today that
                                    we should have included amongst the ‘duties’ in paragraph 2 of
                                    the proposed arrangement a reference to the flood relief surtax
                                    in which the United States are interested. In order to avoid a
                                    last minute alteration of the text, it is proposed to inform
                                    you, after the agreement has been concluded, that both sides
                                    regard the service of this surtax as being covered by the
                                    arrangement.</p>

                                    last between the British Ambassador, Sir Robert Craigie, and the
                                    Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Kensuke Horinouchi,
                                    regarding the service of foreign obligations secured on the
                                    Chinese Maritime Customs revenue and other relevant matters. As
                                    a result of this exchange of views the Japanese Government have
                                    notified His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom of the
                                    temporary measures which they propose to take, during the period
                                    of hostilities, to regulate these matters and they have received
                                    in reply the assurance that the British Government will for
                                    their part offer no objection to the application of these
                                    measures for the period mentioned. It is further understood,
                                    that the Governments of the United States and France do not
                                    propose to raise any objection to the temporary application of
                                    these arrangements.</p>
                                <p>According to these arrangements, which will be subject to
                                    reconsideration in the event of a radical change occurring in
                                    economic conditions, all revenue collected by the customs at

                                    service of such foreign loans and indemnities will be treated as

                        <p>287. Department’s 289, April 29, 8 p.m., via Shanghai, Chinese Maritime
                            Customs. The Department’s interpretation of the fifth document
                            transmitted with our 267, April 23, 8 p.m. is correct. According to
                            Craigie, the Japanese Government by the arrangement under reference will
                            contribute to the servicing of Chinese loans and indemnity payments 2
                            million yuan per month; the Japanese Government could not be expected to
                            provide the foreign exchange necessary to cover the remittances and the
                            Chinese Government must therefore furnish the foreign exchange for the
                            Japanese contribution of 2 million yuan if the Chinese loan service and
                            indemnity payments are to be maintained. Furthermore, according to
                            Craigie, if the Chinese Government should refuse to provide the foreign
                            exchange the arrangement must collapse. Craigie further states that once
                            the arrangement becomes effective he believes that the Japanese might be
                            prevailed upon to collect in foreign currencies 1 million yuan of the 2
                            million customs revenues necessary for loan and indemnity payments,
                            which would lighten the burden on the Chinese National Government to the
                            extent of 1 million yuan. Craigie expresses the opinion, however, that
                            the Chinese Government will not be greatly burdened in providing the
                            foreign exchange necessary to convert the 2 million yuan turned over
                            monthly.</p>

                        <p>Craigie reiterated to me that he believes the arrangement will fall
                            through unless we express no objection. He suggested as a possible
                            formula that he orally assure the Japanese Government that we have no
                            objection to the arrangement upon oral assurances from us to that
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>Our only comment concerning the proposed furnishing of adequate foreign
                            exchange by the Chinese Government is that this would appear to be a
                            purely “pious hope” on the part of the British Ambassador but we have no
                            knowledge that the Chinese Government has been consulted in the
                            premises.</p>

                            of customs agreement to Chinese Minister of Finance with summary of
                            accompanying documents urging Chinese Government to accept or at least
                            not oppose agreement as otherwise Japanese threaten to take over Chinese
                            customs in occupied areas as of May 3rd whereupon Chinese will find
                            themselves with Customs Administration in Japanese hands and used for
                            Japanese purposes.</p>
                        <p>Chinese Government have communicated by telegraph to London, Paris and
                            Washington objections to the implementing of agreement and reservations
                            of rights should agreement be put into effect by British and Japanese
                            without consulting Chinese. These instructions in two telegraphic
                            instructions will doubtless be communicated to you by Chinese Ambassador

                        <p>153. Your 286, May 1, 9 a.m., and 287, May 1, 11 a.m.; Hankow’s 224,
                            April 30, 11 a.m., and the Department’s 152, April 30, 2 p.m., in regard
                            to the Chinese Maritime Customs. From the beginning our position with
                            regard to the question of the Chinese customs has revolved around two
                            objectives: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) that the integrity of the customs
                                <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0695"/>be preserved, and (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) that the customs revenue be safeguarded with
                            special reference to the servicing of foreign loan and indemnity quotas.
                            If and as losses are occasioned to American interests in China by the
                            military and other activities of the Chinese or Japanese Government,
                            this Government must look for indemnification to the Government
                            responsible for such losses. In this customs issue we have consistently
                            held that we did not wish to espouse any particular plan toward
                            attaining the objectives in which we are interested. If a particular
                            plan is put forward, is carried into effect, and operates in such a way
                            as to bring about reasonable attainment of our objectives, we would not
                            expect to make objection. If, however, any particular plan should not in
                            practical operation have that result, we would wish to be free to offer
                            objection. Moreover, should a particular plan when brought to our
                            attention appear to be seriously objectionable we would probably so
                            indicate to the authors or sponsors of that plan.</p>
                        <p>With the foregoing general outline of our position in mind, the
                            Department offers certain specific observations as follows: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The Department naturally assumes that in any arrangement
                                    effected in regard to the Chinese Maritime Customs there would
                                    be no discrimination against the American obligations secured on
                                    customs revenues, including the flood relief surtax.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The Department does not understand the basis of the British
                                    Ambassador’s statement that “the Japanese Government could not
                                    be expected to provide the foreign exchange necessary to cover”
                                    the quotas of the Chinese ports under Japanese military
                                    occupation for the servicing of the foreign obligations secured
                                    upon the Chinese Maritime Customs revenue. The régime set up in
                                    north China following the Japanese military occupation of that
                                    area is receiving the benefit of the foreign exchange accruing
                                    from trade and other commercial transactions in that area. As
                                    illustrative of the latter there may be mentioned an agreement
                                    between Major General Kita and the “Federal Reserve Bank” on one
                                    side and the Yee Tsoong Tobacco Company on the other for the
                                    purchase by the latter with foreign currencies of “Federal
                                    Reserve Bank notes” for the purpose of buying tobacco in
                                    Shantung. Under these circumstances it would appear to be
                                    entirely reasonable for the authorities controlling the area
                                    under Japanese military occupation to provide the foreign
                                    exchange necessary to cover the quotas of the customs ports in
                                    such area.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>There arises the question whether, if the arrangement arrived

                                    to by the American Government and if that arrangement collapsed
                                    because of China’s refusal to agree thereto (and this would seem
                                    to be a not improbable contingency), would not the American
                                    Government be thereby placed at a disadvantage in its attitude
                                    of holding the Japanese <pb n="692" xml:id="pg_692" facs="0696"

                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>In as much as the arrangement must, according to Craigie,

                                    withhold any further comment until the Chinese Government has
                                    made known its attitude toward the whole arrangement.</item>

                            has informed me that he completed the customs arrangement this evening
                            with the Foreign Office and that the Foreign Office will give out to the
                            press tonight or tomorrow morning a statement to the effect that an

                            Ambassador. Craigie also said the Foreign Office will give a communiqué
                            tomorrow afternoon at 2 o’clock giving some details of the arrangement.
                            He expressed the hope that we would be in a position to express “no
                            objection” before the communiqué is issued.</p>

                                <p rend="right">“2nd May, 1938.</p>
                                <p>My dear Grew, As we informed your Embassy by telephone this
                                    evening, the Vice Minister and I exchanged the notes and
                                    confidential letters about the customs at the Ministry of
                                    Foreign Affairs this evening at 6; 00 p.m. For various reasons
                                    it was necessary to move very quickly in order to prevent a
                                    breakdown. For the moment we are merely informing the press of
                                    the bare fact that an understanding has been reached on all
                                    points and that this has been duly recorded. We are avoiding the
                                    word ‘agreement’ and the Japanese are anxious that we should
                                    avoid any reference to an ‘exchange of notes’, owing to possible
                                    difficulties with the Privy Council. Their thesis is that the
                                    notes merely record our understanding and are not in the form
                                    usually employed when an exchange of notes is intended to
                                    consummate a formal agreement.</p>
                                <p>You will remember that I mentioned that there were one or two
                                    points such as the character of the loans to be covered by this
                                    arrangement and methods of transferring the northern quotas to
                                    Shanghai which we had discussed in some detail during our
                                    deliberation. These points have now been recorded in an agreed
                                    record of our final conversation today and I enclose copy of
                                    this document for your strictly confidential information.</p>
                                <p>Believe me, Yours very sincerely, R. L. Craigie.”</p>

                                <p>[“]Record of meeting on the Chinese Maritime Customs question
                                    between Mr. Horinouchi and Sir Robert Craigie held at the
                                    Ministry of Foreign Affairs on May 2, 1938.</p>
                                <p>Point 1. Customary Grants.</p>
                                <p>To prevent any possibility of misunderstanding Mr. Horinouchi and
                                    Sir Robert Craigie agreed that the wording of paragraph 3 of the
                                    proposed arrangement was intended to cover not only the
                                    customary payments normally made by the Commissioners of Customs
                                    before remitting the balances to the Inspector General of
                                    Customs but also those payments normally made by the Inspector
                                    General himself before meeting the service of the foreign
                                    obligations.</p>
                                <p>Point 2. Method of obtaining exchange for transfer of North China
                                    quotas.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Horinouchi pointed out that the Tientsin branches of the Bank
                                    of China and the Bank of Communications have considerable credit
                                    balances at the Shanghai offices of these banks. The best way to
                                    enable the Tientsin branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank to remit
                                    the foreign loan quotas from ports in North China to its
                                    Shanghai branch would be to let the Tientsin branches of these
                                    Chinese banks sell remittance bills against these credit
                                    balances. He asked that the British authorities should use their
                                    influence to secure the cooperation of the Chinese banks to that
                                    end. Sir Robert Craigie stated that although this would involve
                                    great difficulty, the British authorities in China would be
                                    prepared to place this proposal before the Chinese banks
                                    concerned.</p>
                                <p>In reply to Sir Robert Craigie’s inquiry as to what further
                                    measures would be taken for the creation of the necessary
                                    exchange, Mr. Horinouchi stated that should this prove
                                    necessary, it was intended to use in full the deposits which
                                    were to be transferred to the Yokohama Specie Bank from the Hong
                                    Kong and Shanghai Bank at Shanghai, Tientsin and Chinwangtao for
                                    the payment of foreign loan quotas due from ports in North
                                    China.</p>
                                <p>Sir Robert Craigie stated that, according to a telegram received
                                    from His Majesty’s Government’s Ambassador in China, the amount
                                    of the balance in the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank at Shanghai of
                                    the Shanghai customs revenue account, the revenue surtax account
                                    and the flood relief surtax account amounted to $24,829,703.46
                                    up to and including April 29, last. The similar balance in
                                    Tientsin and Chinwangtao was $1,762,841.85.</p>
                                <p>Point 3. Foreign obligations covered by the proposed
                                    arrangement.</p>
                                <p>Sir Robert Craigie stated that it was his understanding that
                                    paragraph 2 was intended to cover not only those loans which
                                    were directly secured on the customs revenue but also the
                                    foreign obligations having the customs revenue as a contingent
                                    security, i. e., the Tientsin–Pukow and Hukuang Railway loans.
                                    The contingent liability of the customs, in respect of the
                                    latter loan did not arise until 1941, so that, so far as he was
                                    concerned, the only loans enjoying a contingent charge which
                                    would fall within the scope of the present arrangement were the
                                    Tientsin–Pukow Railway loans. Sir Robert Craigie added that the
                                    principal and interest of these loans were secured on the
                                    railway revenues, but the customs were to make good deficiencies
                                    in interest payments. The contingent liability of the customs
                                    for the remainder of tne present <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694"
                                        facs="0698"/>year was 125,000 pounds; for each year 1929 to
                                    1941 inclusive 307,000 pounds; the liability thereafter slowly
                                    decreasing.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Horinouchi replied that he was prepared to recognize the
                                    contingent interest of these loans in the customs revenue on the
                                    understand which had a contingent charge on the customs revenue,
                                    should also be regarded as covered by the arrangement. As
                                    examples he quoted the two principal loans involved namely: (<hi
                                        rend="italic">a</hi>) 6 percent treasury note in gold yen
                                    for the compensation of public properties and salt interests in
                                    Tsingtao (1923). (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Chinese Government 8
                                    percent bonds for refunding internal and foreign short term
                                    debts (1922) so-called Japanese portion of the $96,000,000
                                    loan.</p>
                                <p>He added that the Japanese Government had no present intention of
                                    putting forward a claim that any of these loans should be
                                    serviced out of the customs revenue.</p>
                                <p>Sir Robert Craigie stated that no objection would be raised by
                                    his Government for their part in the event of the Japanese
                                    Government putting forward claims in connection with these
                                    Japanese loans. He also concurred in the view expressed by Mr.
                                    Horinouchi that the status of the various loans was not affected
                                    one way or the other by the fact that they would be regarded as
                                    falling within the scope of the proposed arrangement”</p>

                            Craigie has just informed me that owing to a misunderstanding, his
                            Government released last night for publication in this morning’s London
                            papers, the press communiqué containing the final sentence in paragraph
                            1 that: “It is further understood that the Governments of the United
                            States and France do not propose to raise any objection to the temporary
                            application of these arrangements.” Craigie expresses sincere regret for
                            this unfortunate occurrence and requests me so to inform you. He thought
                            that his Government would not release the communiqué until tomorrow and
                            that there would be plenty of time for him to have the sentence
                            concerning the American attitude eliminated if it is true, after I had
                            received and communicated to him the Department’s final instructions. I
                            also expressed regret and pointed out the unfortunate repercussions
                            which might occur in case the statement under reference in the
                            communiqué should prove to be inaccurate. I told him that I was
                            expecting the Department’s final instructions at any moment but <pb
                                n="695" xml:id="pg_695" facs="0699"/>that I had already informed him
                            2 days ago that the Department’s reaction to his proposal for an inquiry
                            from the Japanese Government regarding our attitude was unfavorable and
                            that the Department had already gone on record as saying that it had no
                            comment to make on the general terms of the arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Craigie states that the sentence quoted above will be eliminated from the
                            communiqué to be issued in Japan today.</p>

                        <p>231. My 227, May 2, 4 p.m. Counselor [of] British Embassy has just
                            permitted me to read communication which British Ambassador made to
                            Generalissimo urging Chinese Government to accept or at least not oppose
                            customs agreement. MacKillop asked me for an expression of my opinion of
                            the agreement. I told him that I was not in a position to express any
                            opinion officially but that personally, assuming as I had assumed, that
                            the Japanese from the beginning had intended to take over the customs,
                            this agreement would be interpreted as evidence of British acquiescence
                            therein and of willingness on the part of the British Government to
                            legalize Japanese capture of customs.</p>
                        <p>MacKillop stated that he had been instructed to ask me also whether I was
                            in a position to take action with the Chinese Government similar to that
                            taken by the British Ambassador. I stated that my answer to that was
                            that I could not take such action; that thus far we had refrained from
                            offering any advice to the Chinese as to what they should do in the
                            matter; and that if asked by the Department for my views I would
                            recommend against taking such action here. British Counselor stated that
                            he had anticipated this reply, as he had all along understood my point
                            of view.</p>
                        <p>He stated that in his interview with Kung latter had complained against
                            British action in reaching an agreement with the Japanese without
                            consulting the Chinese. I understand from British counselor that
                            agreement is to be signed today.</p>

                        <p>233. Tokyo’s 289, May 2, midnight, I have just seen Kung, at his request,
                            who is much disturbed over agreement and particularly over statement
                            issued in London and carried in Reuter despatch received here today to
                            the effect that the American Government will not object to the
                            agreement. Kung hopes that this does not put us publicly in position of
                            at least tacit approval of an arrangement made by third parties without
                            China’s consent which deprives China of control of customs and which
                            discriminates as between bonds secured on customs.</p>

                            this morning carries an account by Hugh Byas dated Tokyo, May 2, of the
                            British-Japanese arrangement in the course of which there appears the
                            following: “The negotiations were conducted between Japanese and British
                            authorities only, but other interested powers, including the United
                            States and France, have been kept informed of the progress made and have
                            raised no objection.”</p>
                        <p>Such account and the release made in London will, of course, be noted in
                            foreign offices the world over, regardless what may be the character of
                            the communiqué issued officially in Japan.</p>

                        <p>236. Supplementing my 233, May 3, 7 p.m., I added that during
                            conversation Kung invited attention to the following: that while he
                            appreciated the good intentions of the British Government in trying to
                            protect British and Chinese interests in the customs, still the
                            agreement would result in assisting Japan at China’s expense and would
                            place China in a very difficult situation. He remarked that this was the
                            first time since the Washington Conference that two foreign countries
                            had entered into an agreement concerning China without China’s
                            participation. He felt that this created a dangerous precedent. He
                            pointed out that one of the interpretations of the agreement might be
                            that it sanctioned Japan’s violation of the interests of foreign powers
                            by military power at their seizure of revenue, in disregard of rights of
                            holders including foreign nationals, of internal bonds, and by altering
                            the status of the customs.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Kung asked me specifically whether it was true that the American
                            Government would not object to the agreement as stated in the Reuter
                            despatch. I told Dr. Kung that I had no information in regard to the
                            attitude of the American Government concerning this matter, and that I
                            was not informed as to whether the American Government had stated that
                            it would not oppose the agreement. Dr. Kung asked me to convey these
                            views to you and I said that I would. Dr. Kung stated that the
                            arrangement had put him in a very embarrassing position. He does not
                            wish to alienate British sympathy. He has refused to issue any
                            instructions to Maze in regard to matter, apparently in this matter
                            yielding to the request of the British that he not oppose it. Young
                            informed me this morning that local Commissioner of Customs called on
                            Kung and stated that he had received a telegram from Maze indicating his
                            difficulties in the light of present agreement. Kung told Commissioner
                            of Customs that he was not issuing specific instructions; that standing
                            instructions should be sufficient to enable Maze to know what he should
                            do, as he was an officer of the Chinese Government. This of course
                            leaves Maze in a very difficult situation because he will now be pressed
                            by Japanese and British to pay over moneys deposited in his name in Hong
                            Kong and Shanghai Bank under an agreement to which his Government is not
                            a party.</p>

                            p.m., to Tokyo, which Tokyo was instructed to repeat to you. With

                            confidence that by the time the Department had received from the British

                            relates to payments from north China in national currency, the
                            arrangement had already been agreed upon by the British Ambassador and
                            the Japanese Foreign Office, but that the Department nevertheless
                            definitely queried the reasonableness of that part of the arrangement.
                            You may say to Kung also in confidence that we were asked to indicate
                            that we had no objection to the arrangement and that we replied that we
                            desired to withhold any further comment until the Chinese Government had
                            made known its attitude toward the whole arrangement.</p>

                                    effect constitute non-fulfillment by such areas of a vital

                        <p>2. Having in mind the action of the British Ambassador in keeping us
                            informed of the progress of the negotiations which he has been
                            conducting with the Japanese authorities, and our desire to avoid, as
                            far as is consistent with the protection of our interests, any
                            embarrassment to him or to the French Ambassador, the Department offers
                            for your consideration the suggestion that you acquaint the British and
                            French Ambassadors with the proposed approach above outlined, and
                            endeavor to arrive at an understanding with them in regard to such an
                            approach. Would it, perhaps, be practicable for them, under the existing
                            circumstances, to make parallel approaches to the Japanese?</p>
                        <p>3. Your comment upon the foregoing is requested.</p>

                                153, May 2, 8 p.m., he brought out the fact that the Japanese had
                                consented, in the event the Chinese Government should refuse to
                                provide the foreign exchange necessary to remit for loan and
                                indemnity services the 2 million yuan contributed from the customs
                                in areas under Japanese control, to furnish foreign exchange from
                                the customs revenues collected in foreign currencies at Shanghai
                                which amounted to upwards of 3 to 4 million yuan monthly. He further
                                stated that the British authorities in China for their part would

                                between a tacit and a positive attitude on our part. He said that
                                the Foreign Office in Tokyo had given him the same information as

                                next telegram regarding the Chinese customs to say “although the
                                United States and France have not expressed objections, and this has
                                been confirmed by the Foreign Office, it should be understood that
                                silence on the part of the American Government in no sense implies

                            <item>Craigie explained to me fully the circumstances which necessitated
                                the sudden conclusion of the arrangement on May 2nd. The Japanese
                                Ministry of Finance acting on the advice of the military had
                                violently objected to the offer of the Vice Minister to release the
                                arrears on the foreign loan and indemnity service at present
                                deposited in the Hong Kong [and] Shanghai Bank amounting to
                                4,000,000 yuan to meet the overdraft for which they act as security
                                and the Finance Ministry had finally agreed to this provision only
                                if the agreement were concluded not later than May 2nd. Horinouchi
                                said: “We cannot longer hold the military in line”.</item>

                            <item>Craigie told me that he had definite information from the British
                                Ambassador in China that the Chinese Government must and would
                                object technically to the arrangement for political reasons but that
                                actually they would not oppose it in practice. Craigie said that he
                                had spoken with the Chinese Chargé d’Affaires in Tokyo a month or so
                                ago and had informed him of the general purport of the arrangement
                                and that there seemed to be no doubt that the Chinese Government was
                                aware that an arrangement was under consideration. (We were hitherto
                                unaware of this conversation with the Chinese Chargé
                                d’Affaires.)</item>

                        <p>340. Department’s 139, May 4, 5 p.m. Department’s instructions carried
                            out this morning. Dr. Kung informed me that Counselor of British Embassy
                            called on him yesterday and communicated to him a message from British
                            Ambassador to the effect that the Ambassador had no arguments which he
                            cared to advance in rebuttal of statements which Kung had made to him,
                            which I assumed were along the lines of those communicated in my 236,
                            May 4, 1 p.m., but that agreement was temporary and all that could be
                            obtained at the moment, and British Ambassador expressed the hope that
                            Dr. Kung would not actively oppose the agreement. Since November Kung
                            stated that he had asked British Counselor to inform British Ambassador
                            that he appreciated all that the friendly powers had done by their
                            active assistance which they had rendered in the interest of China’s
                            credit and the protection of the Customs Administration, but he wanted
                            to point out that the agreement seemed to have a more important aspect
                            than might seem at first apparent. He referred specifically to the
                            undertakings entered into by the powers in the Nine Power Treaty,
                            reminded the Ambassador that Great Britain had by this treaty undertaken
                            to do nothing to abridge China’s sovereignty or administrative
                            integrity. He wondered whether this agreement meant that the British
                            Government no longer considered the Nine Power Treaty as binding. He
                            stated that the British Counselor demurred to this pointing out that the
                            British Government had taken the initiative in convening the Conference
                            at Brussels under the Nine Power Treaty; that the British Government
                            certainly considered the Nine Power Treaty as binding. Kung then pointed
                            out that the British Government having entered into this undertaking
                            with the Japanese Government, it must watch the Japanese very carefully.
                            He referred to numerous reports that the Japanese or their puppets
                            intended to take over the customs, put up the five barred flag and
                            appoint a superintendent of customs at Shanghai and he said that the
                            British might discover that the Japanese might violate the Nine Power
                            Treaty through their puppets. He said that he had told the British
                            Counselor that he would try not to do anything to oppose the carrying
                            out of the understanding, but that his undertaking to this effect was
                            now contingent upon the Japanese not violating the Nine Power Treaty
                            through the agency of their puppets.</p>

                        <p>624. I am reliably informed that Li Chien Nan recently reported to have
                            been appointed Chinese Superintendent of Customs at Shanghai by the
                            so-called “Reformed Government” called on the Commissioner of Customs
                            this morning and informed him of his appointment to the post mentioned.
                            The Commissioner is understood to have been polite but noncommittal. At
                            Li’s request the Commissioner showed him the office of the Chinese
                            Superintendent but Li did not indicate whether he expects to occupy the
                            office forthwith. I understand the Commissioner denies the story
                            published by Domei to the effect that Li informed him that the “Reformed
                            Government” had taken over control of the Shanghai customs and that he
                            and Sir Frederick Maze had been commissioned by that so-called
                            government as Commissioner and Inspector General respectively. Five
                            barred flag is not being flown over the customs.</p>

                        <p>625. Reference my 624, May 6, 4 p.m. Mr. A. Tajiri, First Secretary of
                            the Japanese Embassy, called on the Inspector General of Customs
                            yesterday and requested him to transfer forthwith to the Yokohama Specie
                            Bank the Shanghai customs revenue balance in the Hong Kong and Shanghai
                            Bank. The Inspector General informed him that he could not comply with
                            the request unless the Chinese Government first expressed no objection
                            to such procedure. The Inspector General intimated that the recent
                            provisional arrangement of depositing current revenue collections in the
                            Yokohama Specie Bank is liable to cancellation in the event of the
                            Chinese Government’s dissension.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese authorities, through Tajiri, requested the Shanghai
                            Commissioner of Customs to call on the head of the Executive Yuan of the
                            so-called “Reformed Government” in Nanking. The Inspector General
                            replied that he could not authorize the Commissioner to establish
                            contact with the new régime.</p>
                        <p>In response to request for the appointment of a senior Japanese customs
                            employee in the Financial Secretary’s office, the Inspector General said
                            that the proportion of Japanese employees in the customs establishment
                            at Shanghai cannot be further increased at the present. Tajiri stressed
                            the importance of settling as soon as possible the question of the

                            Maritime Customs. In further discussion yesterday with my British
                            colleague he brought out the following points.</p>

                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>His main purpose in his negotiations with the Japanese Government
                                has been to produce an arrangement which would stand some chance of
                                working satisfactorily in practice.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>To depend on the Japanese to furnish the foreign exchange
                                necessary to pay the foreign obligations of the customs would be
                                illusory simply because the Japanese do not at least at present
                                possess or command in North China the foreign exchange necessary for
                                servicing the northern quotas. The Vice Minister in their
                                discussions said that with the best will in the world they could not
                                at present do so in practice and Craigie is convinced that this
                                statement is correct.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The Chinese have up to the present produced sufficient foreign
                                exchange to meet these obligations and in the opinion of the British
                                experts they can continue to do so. If however it should become
                                known in China that we were pressing the Japanese to produce this
                                foreign exchange, this, in Craigie’s opinion, would be tantamount to
                                an invitation to the Chinese to refuse to furnish the foreign
                                exchange necessary for the quotas of the areas in North
                                China.</item>

                            <item>With reference to our 294, May 5, 7 p.m., paragraph 1, Craigie has
                                now modified his previous statement to me (McGurk<note n="90"
                                    xml:id="d742fn90">Joseph F. McGurk, First Secretary of Embassy

                                understood Craigie to say) that the Japanese had consented in the
                                event the Chinese Government should refuse to provide the foreign
                                exchange necessary to remit for loan <pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706"
                                    facs="0710"/>and indemnity services the 2 million yuan
                                contributed from the customs in areas under Japanese control to
                                furnish foreign exchange from the customs revenues collected in
                                foreign currencies at Shanghai. Craigie now says that he had
                                discussed this matter with Horinouchi and that while he had nothing
                                in writing to confirm the latter’s agreement to such an arrangement
                                it was his understanding that the question was to be left for
                                further discussion here or in Shanghai to ascertain whether such
                                procedure could be worked out.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Craigie states that it would not necessarily embarrass him if I
                                were to make the approach to the Japanese Foreign Office outlined by
                                the Department so long as it was done orally and without publicity
                                but for Craigie himself to take parallel action would be merely to
                                repeat what in effect he has been saying to the Japanese Government
                                during the past several weeks. He considers that his negotiations
                                over the past few months concluding with the arrangement of May 2
                                fully cover his side of the question and he is doubtful if the
                                French, having approved the arrangement, would feel that they could
                                ask for further assurances. I have not consulted my French colleague
                                but I am inclined to agree with Craigie’s estimate of the French
                                attitude.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>Craigie acknowledges that his arrangement may not work but he
                                believes that it was the very best agreement that could be
                                concluded. He hopes that we will wait to see if it does work.</item>
                            <label/>
                            <item>Our comment follows.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>It seems to us that the first step in considering the Department’s
                                proposed approach to the Japanese Government would be to decide
                                whether there is available in the Japanese occupied areas other than
                                Shanghai foreign exchange for the remittance to Shanghai in foreign
                                currencies of quotas for servicing foreign loans and indemnities.
                                Craigie affirms that such foreign exchange is not available and that
                                view is substantially confirmed by reports emphasizing the
                                difficulties which the North China régime is having on this score.
                                The Japanese presumably cannot be persuaded to place at the disposal
                                of the North China régime their own limited reserves of foreign
                                exchange. For the time being, therefore, it appears improbable that
                                the North China quotas could be remitted in foreign currencies even
                                if the Japanese were agreeable to the proposition in principle.
                                However, with prospects of revival of exports in North China there
                                should be accumulated a reserve of foreign exchange which could be
                                available in the course of time for quota remittances.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>The British are committed to try out the arrangement which they
                                have just made with the Japanese and Craigie made it clear to me
                                that he could not recommend that the British Government go along
                                with us on the proposed approach to the Japanese if made now. The
                                French, according to Craigie, have by approving the arrangement
                                associated themselves with the British.</item>

                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>It is therefore our view that we should withhold the proposed
                                action while carefully watching the operation of the recent
                                arrangement. If then the conditions envisaged by the Department
                                should threaten to arise, our representations when made would rest
                                on a firmer basis than they would, we believe, if made now.</item>
                            <label>10.</label>
                            <item>If, however, the Department feels that some tactical advantage is
                                to be gained by making the suggested approach now, I can see no
                                important objection.</item>

                        <p>297. Reference Tokyo’s 294, May 5, 7 p.m., which Tokyo has been requested
                            to repeat to you. Department understands that the “2 million yuan
                            contributed from the customs in areas under Japanese control” referred
                            to in paragraph 1 of the telegram under reference is contemplated as the
                            share of the Tsingtao, Chefoo, Tientsin and Ching-wangtao customs
                            districts which are in the area of the new “Federal Reserve Currency”
                            and does not include Shanghai or other Yangtze river customs districts
                            which are outside such area. With the foregoing in mind the Department
                            desires to know whether the equivalent of 3 to 4 million yuan monthly is
                            actually being collected at Shanghai by the customs in foreign
                            currencies and, if so, what disposition is now being made of such
                            collections by the bank or banks in which they are being deposited. The
                            Department would also welcome your comment whether payment from such
                            collections of the foreign exchange quotas of the north China ports in
                            the area of the new “Federal Reserve Currency” would affect adversely
                            the Chinese Government’s foreign exchange resources. Also, if
                            practicable, please ascertain whether the foreign currencies collected
                            at Shanghai would be adequate to supply Shanghai’s quota of foreign
                            exchange in addition to the quotas of the north China ports.</p>
                        <p>In endeavoring to obtain the information desired by the Department, as
                            indicated above, please do not disclose the information reported in
                            Tokyo’s telegram under reference.</p>

                        <p>632. My number 624, May 6, 4 p.m. With reference to the report that the
                            “Reformed Government” has taken over the Shanghai customs, the Japanese
                            Consul General today informed the Secretary of the Consular Body that
                            the Inspector General and the Commissioner of Customs had actually
                            recognized the new situation. While I have not been able to ascertain
                            whether the Inspector General and Commissioner has in fact recognized
                            the new situation, such recognition would seem to be inevitable.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese staff of the customs threatened to walk out this morning. The
                            Commissioner is understood to be endeavoring to persuade them not to do
                            so and the staff is meeting to come to a decision on this point. It is
                            understood that all foreign members of the staff propose to remain.</p>

                                exchange resources, it must necessarily be an important factor at
                                present when little or no foreign exchange is accruing to the
                                Chinese Government in the areas under Japanese occupation. The
                                average amount of foreign exchange allowed by the Central Government
                                each week ranges from 20% to 30% of average amount applied for which
                                latter amount averages about 1,000,000 pounds. The Hankow

                                and they are now beginning to designate items which may be covered

                            <item>It would seem that the question of foreign exchange for customs
                                collections in the occupied areas rests entirely upon the action of
                                the authorities at Hankow who administer the exchange regulations.
                                To withhold the permits might impair Chinese Government credit and
                                to grant necessary allotments would strengthen the Japanese hold on
                                the customs in the occupied areas. If the Chinese make it possible

                                foreign exchange, I believe it will be only because they do not wish
                                to impair their credit abroad or on account of political
                                expediency.</item>

                        <p>659. My 649, May 12, 6 p.m. The amount of foreign exchange acquired this
                            year by the Central Bank of China through the sale of customs gold units
                            for payment of customs duties, according to records furnished me by the
                            Central Bank, has been as follows: 13,000 United States dollars and
                            2,781 pounds all acquired prior to March 18. Of the total about 8,000
                            United States dollars were obtained at Shanghai and the balance by the
                            Tientsin branch.</p>
                        <p>The customs are collecting duties at fixed rates based on the official
                            value of the Chinese currency.</p>
                        <p>Owing to the spread between the official rate and the open market rate
                            existing since the currency decree of March 13, it has been considerably
                            cheaper for importers having foreign exchange to sell it on the open
                            market and pay duties with the resultant local currency. No foreign
                            exchange accrues to the Chinese Government either directly or indirectly
                            as a result of such transactions although they do serve to hold up the
                            open market value of Chinese currency.</p>
                        <p>The spread between the official rate and the open market rate is now over
                            20% in Shanghai.</p>

                        <p>680. Inspector General of Customs has received instructions from the
                            Minister of Finance to transmit the balance of 25 million dollars local
                            currency standing to the credit of the Shanghai Commissioner’s revenues
                            accounts with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank to the Central Bank of
                            China. The Inspector General has informed the British Ambassador that
                            “as the Shanghai Commissioner’s balance in the Hong Kong and Shanghai
                            Bank was satisfactory and been kept intact for the Chinese Government
                            under the protection of the interested powers (notably Great Britain) it
                            is incumbent upon me to take no action without ascertaining your
                            attitude in this connection”.</p>

                        <p>The Inspector General is proposing to telegraph the Minister of Finance
                            at Hankow that in view of the political situation here, more especially
                            with reference to the Shanghai customs issue which he states is not yet
                            settled, he suggests that question of transfer of the above funds to
                            Central Bank be deferred for the time being “otherwise impasse may
                            result”. He proposes to suggest that, since the balance in question has
                            been accumulated, [and?] “has been held in safety under the protection
                            of interested powers”, their views on the subject should be ascertained
                            before coming to a definite decision on the matter of transferring the
                            funds. I understand from officials of Central Bank here that the bank
                            has granted sizeable overdrafts to the customs principally if not
                            entirely to meet interest payments on internal loans for which the
                            customs revenues are security. The 25,000,000 would probably go in part
                            to meet such overdraft. The Minister of Finance has informed the
                            Inspector General that the Central Bank will continue to permit the
                            customs to draw from the Bank which will charge customs account as
                            overdraft.</p>

                            receipts with Hong Kong–Shanghai Bank which apparently represents an
                            accumulation since last November. He states that this sum could rightly
                            have been used for payment of loan obligations, but that as matter now
                            stands Shanghai has made no contributions to loan obligations since
                            November, Shanghai’s obligations having been met by an overdraft on the
                            Central Bank. I understand customs agreement negotiated by British is
                            not functioning, as Japan refuses to perform their part of agreement
                            until Chinese turn over this balance. Young states that this sum now in
                            Hong Kong–Shanghai Bank is causing some embarrassment in currency
                            situation, as it has been used by bank in the form of loans, one of
                            which was made to the Yokohama Specie Bank, thus increasing the amount
                            of currency in circulation at Shanghai and softening the currency
                            situation to that extent.</p>

                                with me a <hi rend="italic">pro memoria</hi> setting forth the
                                points in the Department’s 157 but I did not leave it with Hirota
                                because as the conversation progressed I sensed that it would only
                                serve to increase irritation and to invite a written rebuff without
                                accomplishing any constructive purpose.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>At one point in our talk Hirota said: “Have you recognized the
                                Provisional Government of North China[?]” to which I replied in the
                                negative and said that in the question under discussion my
                                Government holds the Japanese authorities responsible. Hirota’s
                                implication, although not very clearly stated, seems to have been
                                that we are asking something, namely the furnishing of foreign
                                exchange to holders of the national currency, which is the
                                prerogative of an independent government and that we are not
                                entitled to demand that the Provisional Government fulfill this
                                function unless we are prepared to recognize it as an independent
                                state. His argument while thoroughly specious indicates that in
                                diplomatic controversies relating to North China Hirota will
                                probably pursue the same tactics as he has followed in questions
                                relating to Manchukuo.</item>

                            <item>As I conceive the situation, the Japanese Foreign Office considers

                                difficulty with the army which undoubtedly desired to confiscate the

                                paragraph 2, there was a moment when the issue was “touch and go”
                                and when the whole situation might have been lost had not the

                                    fact, providing the only support for that currency in North
                                    China, as the Hankow Government is making no allotments of
                                    exchange to Tientsin.</p>
                                <p>The Japanese authorities cannot be said to be acquiring any
                                    foreign exchange which, in the ordinary course, could be made
                                    available for the service of customs secured foreign loans. If,
                                    in existing circumstances, they are pressed to provide this
                                    foreign exchange, there seems only two courses open to them:</p>
                                <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) To compete with the foreign banks for
                                    export bills, or, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) to impose exchange
                                    control and to attempt to make the Federal Reserve Bank an
                                    effective central bank for North China. Either course would
                                    produce results inimical to foreign trade interests.</p>
                                <p>Turning to Central China there is, as you know, no Japanese
                                    sponsored currency in existence in that area, and customs duties
                                    are collected solely in Chinese national currency. It seems
                                    clearly the responsibility of the Hankow Government to exchange
                                    these collections into foreign currency for amount necessary to
                                    meet that portion of the foreign loan service chargeable to that
                                    area.</p>
                                <p>Here again if we insist, in present circumstances, on the
                                    Japanese authorities providing the foreign exchange to meet the
                                    customs secured foreign loans, they can only do so by imposing
                                    some form of exchange control, unless they provide the foreign
                                    exchange from their own reserves in Japan, which seems
                                    inconceivable. Exchange control in Central China would imply a
                                    severe restriction of imports in view of the adverse balance of
                                    trade in that area. Moreover, the Japanese would be sorely
                                    tempted to set up a new bank in Central China on lines similar
                                    to the Federal Reserve Bank in North China as a means of
                                    obtaining complete financial control in the area. If any such
                                    new bank is created in Central China, I fear it will be the
                                    final blow to the Chinese national currency and complete
                                    currency collapse would sooner or later ensue. Either exchange
                                    control or a new bank of issue in Central China would again
                                    hamper all foreign trading interests.</p>
                                <p>I quite recognize that it is most reprehensible of the Japanese
                                    to have launched a new currency in North China which can be
                                    employed in discharge of customs duties while at the same time
                                    making this currency convertible. Nevertheless, I feel that the
                                    dangers of insisting at this juncture on payment through
                                    Japanese agencies of the foreign currency necessary to meet the
                                    customs secured foreign loans may lead to measures being imposed
                                    which, on other and more general grounds, we are pointing out to
                                    the Japanese Government are undesirable and prejudicial to
                                    foreign interests.”</p>

                        <p>2. Craigie feels strongly that if the Chinese Government learns that we
                            are pressing the Japanese to furnish foreign exchange the Chinese
                            authorities will become more intransigent.</p>

                        <p>714. Hankow Embassy’s 273 [<hi rend="italic">263</hi>], May 23, noon.
                            Inspector General of Customs informed me that he recently despatched a
                            telegram to the Minister of Finance in which he stated that it is
                            becoming increasingly difficult in existing circumstances to continue to
                            withhold payment of Japanese portion of Boxer indemnity outstanding
                            since September last and deposited in Hong Kong and Shanghai bank and
                            that it may become necessary to ease the tension and obviate actual
                            deadlock to consider question of releasing these deposits at an early
                            date. The Inspector General has informed the British Ambassador at
                            Shanghai in writing that: “I have repeatedly alluded to the impropriety
                            of not liquidating the terms of the protocol, and resumption of the
                            payment of Japan’s share of the indemnity month by month as it falls due
                            and if this view is supported I suggest that the representatives of the
                            interested powers in Hankow should be advised accordingly.” I shall keep
                            the Department informed of further developments in this matter.</p>

                            the Japanese Embassy has approached him and the Japanese military
                            authorities are prepared to permit the resumption of normal customs

                                facs="0722"/>submitted to the Inspector General on May 21 by the
                            Japanese Consul General provides for the cooperation of the Japanese
                            military and naval authorities in ensuring the payments of duty on
                            non-military Japanese imports and in preventing smuggling under the

                                    least 85 examiners and 40 tidewaiters of Japanese nationality;
                                    also to facilitate the smooth working of the recent
                                    Anglo-Japanese arrangement, the employment of a Japanese
                                    assistant secretary or revenue accountant.</item>

                        <p>2. In his letter of transmittal to me the Inspector General states that
                            he believes it is generally admitted that in the interests of
                            international trade it is essential to restore normal trade conditions
                            here and to endeavor to place the control of trade and shipping on an
                            equal basis and he therefore suggests that the Japanese proposals merit
                            favorable consideration.</p>

                        <p>726. My 723, May 26, midnight.</p>
                        <p>1. Inspector General of Customs informs me that new rules concerning the
                            depositing and remittance of customs revenues have been promulgated by
                            the Minister of Finance and that these rules which are applicable to
                            those provinces in which the customs are functioning purely under
                            Chinese control provide that as from June 1, 1938, the ports concerned
                            are to remit to the Inspector General’s revenue account in the Hong Kong
                            and Shanghai Bank, Shanghai, only their exact quota of the cost of
                            meeting the installments of the foreign loan <pb n="719" xml:id="pg_719"
                                facs="0723"/>and indemnity obligations secured on the customs
                            revenue (based on the percentage duties for the preceding month), the
                            service expenditure of the Inspectorate General of Customs and the
                            grants regularly paid from the net revenue collected, and that the
                            balance of the revenue collection of these ports after making these
                            payments is to be remitted direct to Hankow for the service of internal
                            loans.</p>
                        <p>2. The Inspector General has commented on the above in writing as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The significance of these instructions is that from 1st June
                                    1938 revenue collected in the Chinese controlled areas will be
                                    available to meet only a part of China’s foreign commitments
                                    secured on the customs revenue and that, unless I receive in
                                    time from foreign loan and indemnity quotas from ports in the
                                    Japanese controlled areas, I shall find myself unable to provide
                                    the full service of the foreign loans and the indemnity.</p>
                                <p>I propose to make during this month provision in advance for the
                                    June installment of the 4½% Anglo-German loan of 1898, due on
                                    the 4th June 1938, from revenue remittances already to hand from
                                    ports in Chinese areas, on the understanding that a proper
                                    adjustment of this operation will be made subsequently. Unless,
                                    however, in the meantime, full quotas come forward from Japanese
                                    controlled ports it will be impossible for me to meet on the
                                    17th June 1938 the July installment of the Reorganization loan
                                    of 1913, or on the last of the month the obligations of the
                                    Boxer indemnity and the consolidation note of the United States
                                    Commodity loan of 1925 [<hi rend="italic">1931</hi>] and 1933.
                                    In this connection I desire to point out that, whereas the
                                    estimated cost of meeting the foreign loan and indemnity
                                    obligations during July 1938, at present exchange rates, is
                                    $8,953,000, the Shanghai customs have a balance of $3,703,286.86
                                    deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank and of $25,287,184.68 in
                                    the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, the latter representing
                                    collections made prior to the 3d instant; and that at other
                                    ports in Japanese controlled areas the customs had on deposit on
                                    the 30th ultimo $16,868,367.20 in the Yokohama Specie Bank and
                                    $2,381,106.51 in the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. It will be
                                    understood, therefore, that if these balances could be drawn
                                    upon for remittance to my accounts there would be no immediate
                                    fear of default on the foreign loan service. I accordingly
                                    suggest for your consideration the advisability of making this
                                    situation clear to the Japanese authorities.”</p>

                        <p>1. Inspector General of Customs has informed me that he has received
                            information from the Commissioner of Customs to the effect that the
                            Japanese authorities are prepared to authorize customs control north of
                            Soochow Creek and to introduce the new tariff simultaneously on June 1.
                            Inspector General states that if he is approached on the subject of the
                            application of the revised tariff his position will be that he has no
                            authority to depart from the existing tariff rates. He has inquired what
                            the attitude of the American Government will be in the event of the
                            “Reform Government” attempting to compel the Commissioner of Customs to
                            collect the new rates. The Inspector General fears if he declines to
                            comply with the demand that the new rates be collected the Shanghai
                            Customshouse may be seized and the integrity of the customs service
                            destroyed. He refers to the fact that he suggested some time ago to the
                            Chinese Government the desirability of introducing the 1931 tariff on
                            its own initiative but that no action has yet been taken.</p>

                                new tariff duties, he will be prepared to accept the 1931 rates in
                                payment of customs duties if tendered to him tomorrow. He has asked
                                me whether I would insist that American importers should pay the old
                                duties and I replied that obviously I had no authority to compel
                                business men to pay the old rates if they can import under the 1931
                                rates, but that I would report the matter to the Department at
                                once.</item>

                            <item>It seems to me that if other merchants pay the 1931 rates it would
                                be a discrimination against American merchants if they paid the 1934
                                rates and that American merchants would expect most favored nation
                                treatment. Unless I am instructed to the contrary, the matter of
                                whether the merchants shall pay the 1934 or 1931 rates will be left
                                entirely to their discretion. I cannot imagine any American merchant
                                paying the 1934 rates if the local customs will accept the 1931
                                rates. The British attitude is substantially the same and I believe
                                that importers of other nationalities will take the same
                                stand.</item>

                                distinguished from the Commissioner) will ask me to inform him
                                officially whether the Consulate General will insist upon the
                                payment of the 1934 rates and I recommend that I be authorized to
                                inform him that the matter will be left to the discretion of the
                                importer himself (which in effect will be that the importer will pay
                                the 1931 rates).</item>

                        <p>767. 1. Dr. Lockhart, Associate Director General of the Salt
                            Administration, informed me last night confidentially that the British
                            Ambassador sent to the British Foreign Office a few days ago a telegram
                            of which the following, to the best of Dr. Lockhart’s recollection, is
                            the substance: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Dr. Kung on March 24 wrote MacKillop (Counselor of the British
                                    Embassy at Hankow) that the Chinese Government would be grateful
                                    for the assistance of the British Government towards preventing
                                    by every practicable step the disruption of the Salt
                                    Administration. Embassy suggested that, if the British Foreign
                                    Office approved, it would endeavor to obtain an arrangement with
                                    the Japanese (at the same time keeping the Chinese Government
                                    fully informed in order to obviate such criticism as was
                                    directed against the Anglo-Japanese customs agreement) by which
                                    (1) the Directorate General should be maintained in Shanghai and
                                    the joint authority of the foreign officers should be fully
                                    recognized; (2) Japanese to consent to make available funds for
                                    the necessary expenses and for service of foreign loans secured
                                    on salt revenues; (3) authority of the Directorate General over
                                    district offices to be recognized and maintained; (4) if Dr.
                                    Kung should not agree to permit discussion on the above basis,
                                    efforts should be limited to obtaining assurances of continued
                                    provision for loan service through quotas as reported by the
                                    Associate Director General.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>2. For the Department’s confidential information, there is apparently a
                            difference of opinion in the Salt Administration as to the feasibility
                            of taking any steps such as suggested above or in any way <pb n="723"

                            possibility that the remainder of the personnel may be required to
                            remove there. Dr. Lockhart assures me that he will keep me fully

                        <p>776. My 767, June 3, 4 p.m. Associates of Dr. Lockhart informed me last
                            night that the Minister of Foreign Affairs replied “I generally agree
                            with the proposal.” Lord Halifax<note n="2" xml:id="d765fn2">British
                                Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.</note> added, however, that
                            he was reluctant to proceed in the matter without something in writing
                            from Doctor Kung and he further suggested that in view of the heavy
                            United States interests involved the British Ambassador should proceed
                            in close cooperation with the Salt Administration and “American

                        <p>2. Doctor Lockhart expressed doubt, which doubt I share, that Kung will
                            give to the British authorities any written consent to proceed along the
                            lines set forth in my 767, June 3, 4 p.m.</p>

                        <p>279. I am in receipt of a third person note from the Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs dated June 6 from which I quote the following pertinent
                            paragraphs: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Chinese Maritime Customs at Shanghai has recently been
                                    compelled by the Japanese to enforce an unlawful tariff as from
                                    June 1st. Japanese merchants are now paying duty according to
                                    this tariff and the other foreign merchants are beginning to do
                                    likewise.</p>
                                <p>This act of the Japanese not only impairs the integrity of the
                                    customs but also decreases sharply the customs revenue due the
                                    Chinese Government. The customs revenue normally collected at
                                    Shanghai constitutes over 30% of the total of such revenue for
                                    the whole of <pb n="724" xml:id="pg_724" facs="0728"/>China. If
                                    duty is collected at Shanghai and at all other places under the
                                    control of the Japanese Army according to the unlawful tariff,
                                    there will be almost a 60% decrease in customs revenue and the
                                    ability of the Chinese Government to meet its domestic and
                                    foreign loan obligations will be seriously threatened.</p>
                                <p>The Chinese Government now recommends that the receipts of the
                                    customhouses throughout the country be entrusted to an
                                    international committee appointed by the various countries
                                    interested in the foreign loans, which, together with the
                                    Inspector General of Customs, will take charge of the receipts
                                    and service the loans on behalf of the Chinese Government.</p>
                                <p>The recommendation described above is likewise entirely for the
                                    preservation of the integrity of the Chinese Maritime Customs
                                    and for the safeguarding of lawful rights of Chinese and foreign
                                    nationals. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs requests the American
                                    Ambassador to transmit this recommendation to the American
                                    Government for favorable consideration. If the levy of the
                                    unlawful tariff cannot be prevented, the Chinese Government will
                                    be obliged to reconsider ways and means for the repayment of
                                    foreign loans.</p>

                        <p>798. 1. The British Ambassador has informed me that the Inspector General
                            of Customs has notified him that in recognition of the special
                            circumstances now existing in Shanghai with reference to the collection
                            of customs duties and the likelihood that the present situation will
                            continue for some time he contemplates recruiting about 22 additional
                            examiners and 40 additional tidewaiters, all of Japanese nationality, in
                            order to render effective control at Japanese wharves. Negotiations have
                            been in progress between the customs and Japanese authorities for some
                            time looking to the resumption of customs control north of the Creek and
                            the above arrangement appears to have been a concession on the part of
                            the customs based on a written assurance of the Japanese authorities
                            that they are prepared to cooperate with the customs to check smuggling
                            and generally to require all Japanese firms and individuals to pay duty
                            on dutiable cargo.</p>
                        <p>2. The British Ambassador has informed the Inspector General that he is
                            in agreement with the view that normal conditions should be restored on
                            the wharves in Hongkew, Yangtzepoo and Pootung, that smuggling should
                            cease and that all commercial cargoes and vessels of no matter what
                            nationality should be subject to same customs <pb n="725"
                                xml:id="pg_725" facs="0729"/>treatment. He had stated that while he
                            is not in a position to express any views on the numbers of staff
                            required it is expedient to recruit staff, of Japanese or other
                            nationals, if the customs authorities believe that the attainment of the
                            objectives requested in paragraph 1 would thereby be facilitated.</p>
                        <p>3. It is the Inspector General’s intention to appoint 32 of the
                            above-mentioned Japanese on a contract, not a permanent, basis.</p>

                        <p>838. Embassy’s 279, June 8, 4 p.m., from Hankow. The British Ambassador,
                            on reporting to the Foreign Office at London on the Chinese proposal,
                            stated that he considers that the proposal comes too late and that it is
                            not likely to be accepted by the Japanese Government. The Ambassador
                            reported that the British Embassy made a somewhat similar suggestion
                            last October but that it was not accepted by the Chinese Government and
                            that the Chinese proposal, in his judgment, is the forerunner of a
                            public statement by the Chinese Government that it will not in the
                            future make good from its own funds quotas which should come from
                            Japanese occupied ports. He holds that, in case of such a default, the
                            Chinese Government would try to hold the foreign powers responsible on
                            the grounds that they refused the proposal for international control.
                            The Ambassador recommended that the Chinese Government be advised to
                            permit the Anglo-Japanese Customs Agreement of May last to be
                            implemented; that if such implementation takes place the Chinese
                            Government would cancel it’s instructions to withhold the Japanese Boxer
                            indemnity payments and the transfer to the Yokohama Specie Bank of part
                            of the balances now lying in the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banks in the
                            occupied areas; that on the other hand the Chinese Government would
                            receive at once about $16,000,000 Chinese currency of accumulated funds
                            and would in addition receive in future from the occupied ports their
                            fair share of the cost of servicing foreign obligations secured on the
                            customs.</p>

                                butter being assessed in Shanghai under the “illegal” tariff

                        <p>850. 1. The Inspector General of Customs has informed me that strong
                            pressure is being brought to bear for the appointment of a Japanese
                            Commissioner [of] Customs at Amoy, together with the appointment of
                            Japanese to practically all the important posts in the Amoy customs
                            house. The Inspector General states that this action on the part of the
                            Japanese represents a further attempt to impair the integrity of the
                            customs.</p>
                        <p>2. The Inspector General has also cited as a further impairment the
                            recent seizure of a customs cruiser by the Japanese at Tsingtao for
                            semi-naval purposes and the recent temporary seizure of a customs
                            cruiser at Chefoo for the same purposes. He strongly deprecates these
                            acts on the part of the Japanese and states that their continuation is
                            certain to result in the complete impairment of the customs service as a
                            Chinese institution.</p>

                        <p>301. Your 178, June 14, 3 p.m. My German and Soviet colleagues did not
                            receive notes. Presumably they were addressed only to colleagues
                            interested in loans secured on customs. Shanghai’s 838, June 14, 5 p.m.
                            conveys British Ambassador’s comment. Impression among colleagues here
                            is that note is intended to prepare us for Government’s claim of
                            inability to continue payments on foreign loans guaranteed on customs.
                            This is also my opinion. It comes too late now. I do believe that we
                            should follow suggestion of British Ambassador set forth in Shanghai’s
                            838, June 14, 5 p.m.</p>

                            that although British Embassy had received an intimation that Chinese
                            Government would not consent to arrangement similar to that reached by
                            British Ambassador at Tokyo and Japanese authorities in regard to
                            customs (referred to in Shanghai’s 767, June 3, 4 p.m.), he was now
                            instructed to endeavor to obtain from the Chinese an official yes or no
                            to this view. He referred to the fact that in March Chinese had given
                            British Embassy assurances that it was intended to protect tenure of
                            office of foreign employees of Salt Administration. He said that as a
                            matter of fact such instruction had not been issued by the Chinese
                            Government and that he had been instructed to get the Chinese to
                            reaffirm these assurances. He stated, furthermore, that as regards
                            paragraph 9 of Shanghai’s 371, March 9, 4 p.m., British Government is of
                            the opinion that head office of Salt Administration should be maintained
                            at Shanghai, and I inferred that British Embassy has written to express
                            this opinion officially to the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>MacKillop inquired as to my attitude in regard to these matters. I told
                            him that we had not offered any advice to the Chinese Government in
                            regard to the disposition of the foreign personnel of the Salt
                            Administration; that as regards the question of obtaining from the
                            Chinese Government its official approval or disapproval of an
                            arrangement regarding the Salt Administration along the lines of that
                            reached between Chairman of the Customs [<hi rend="italic">British

                            prepared to take any action, believing that the American Government
                            would not be disposed to participate in any arrangement of this kind,
                            even to the point of asking Chinese consent. I informed MacKillop of
                            action suggested by Grew in his 378, June 14, 2 p.m., and of
                            Department’s approval thereof communicated in its 382, June 15, 7 p.m.,

                            should be located, I informed MacKillop that I did not believe the

                            that orders have been received by it from the Ministry of Finance <pb
                                n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0736"/>to pay from revenues collected
                            in Chinese controlled ports only 44.66 per cent of the loan and
                            indemnity payments secured on the customs revenues and due on June 30.
                            Loans due June 30 include one of United States dollars 788,437 for the
                            quarterly payment on the consolidated note of the United States
                            consignment [<hi rend="italic">commodity</hi>] loans of 1931 and 1933
                            and one of United States dollars 157,760 for the American share of the
                            Boxer indemnity. No funds have yet been put at the disposal of the
                            Inspectorate General under the Anglo-Japanese agreement for the loan
                            quotas of the ports under Japanese occupation and these quotas would
                            amount to 55.34 per cent of the total amount due. The Inspectorate
                            General states that in a similar crisis over payments due earlier this
                            month, Japanese authorities were prevailed upon to pay a sufficient
                            amount from the quotas that would be due if the agreement were
                            implemented to prevent a default and in strict confidence said that
                            arrangements had been made with the Ministry of Finance for an overdraft
                            sufficient to prevent a default in case the Japanese did not pay.
                            However, both the Japanese authorities and the Ministry of Finance
                            stated at the time, according to the Inspectorate General, that no such
                            provision would again be made to prevent default. The Inspectorate
                            General states that the Japanese authorities are adamant this time in
                            their demands that the Anglo-Japanese agreement regarding the Chinese
                            Maritime Customs be implemented in full with regard to all items
                            favorable to the Japanese before further contributions will be made
                            toward loan payments. The Inspectorate General states that while every
                            effort is being made to persuade the Chinese Government to prevent a
                            default, no assurance has yet been obtained that an overdraft will be
                            available in case the so-called Japanese share is not provided by the
                            Japanese authorities and confidentially expressed the hope that the
                            interested governments would endeavor to persuade the Japanese
                            authorities to release adequate funds from the customs collections now
                            being withheld to them to enable full June 30 payments to be made.</p>

                            <item>The yield of salt duties had increased over the past several years
                                to a total of $213,619,500 in the year ended June 30, 1937. Since
                                that time, as a result of hostilities, the revenue has shrunk in
                                alarming proportions and, despite certain rate increases, is
                                estimated at not over $135,000,000 for the year ending June 30th
                                this year. In consequence the continued service from salt revenue of
                                the foreign loans secured thereon is seriously threatened.</item>

                            <item>The cutting off of practically all revenue from the districts
                                occupied in whole or part by the Japanese military, together with
                                the constant pressure for funds not only for general government
                                purposes but especially for insuring a supply of salt to the Yangtze
                                Valley regions heretofore dependent chiefly on salt from the
                                seacoast, have on the one hand seriously impaired current
                                collections of revenue and on the other greatly increased the demand
                                upon both current collections and accumulated surpluses, so that
                                there is grave doubt indeed whether this service can be continued
                                from salt revenue during the remainder of 1938. The area now
                                occupied normally supplies about 60% of revenue and of loan funds.
                                It is sufficient to point out in this connection that the arrears of
                                loan quota from occupied districts accumulated up to May 31, 1938,
                                amounting to Chinese dollars 2,925,000, would, if remitted to loan
                                service accounts, make possible the full payment of interest and
                                amortization due in 1938 on loans secured upon and hitherto met from
                                salt revenue, of which pounds 514,700 and United States dollars
                                130,500 remain to be paid.</item>

                                could be considered an approach to the Japanese authorities in
                                regard to the question of a resumption of remittances of loan quotas
                                and loan quota surtaxes from those districts temporarily out of
                                control to the National Government, but has given earnest thought to
                                the problems involved and has stood ready to consider the details of

                        <p>922. Reference my 899, June 24, 5 p.m., Inspector General Maze has just
                            received a telegram from the Minister of Finance authorizing him to
                            create an overdraft with the Central Bank sufficient to provide the

                            payments and the amount required to meet these payments in full. This
                            last minute authorization was obtained only as the result of most
                            strenuous appeals by Maze to Finance Minister Kung supported by the
                            British Ambassador and is limited to June 30 payments<note n="13"

                        <p>933. My 850, June 16, 6 p.m. Inspector General of Customs informs me that
                            pressure for appointment of Japanese Commissioner of Customs at Amoy is
                            being greatly intensified and that the Japanese have flatly refused to
                            yield any ground. The foreign officers of the customs cruiser at
                            Tsingtao have been withdrawn and the Japanese are now insisting that the
                            Chinese crew on the cruiser remain aboard and continue their customary
                            duties. This demand is creating an extremely awkward situation for the
                            customs and Sir Frederick Maze states that the British authorities in
                            London are becoming greatly exercised over the situation. He suggests
                            some consultation with the British Foreign Office with a view to giving
                            publicity to the matter.</p>

                            Protection by Japanese Navy against Japanese Army”, I have the honor to
                            report, as of possible interest, that the Chinese Maritime Customs
                            preventive ship <hi rend="italic">Hai An</hi> was confiscated by the
                            Japanese naval authorities on June 22, 1938. The vessel was boarded
                            while at anchor in the inner harbor by a Japanese naval officer and a
                            detachment of marines, and the officer demanded that the ship be turned
                            over to the Japanese navy. The Master replied that he had no authority
                            to do so, whereupon the Japanese officer threatened to take the vessel
                            by force. Being unable to offer any resistance, the Master and Chief
                            officer, both of whom are British, abandoned the ship. The Chinese
                            officers and crew are being retained at least for the time being.</p>

                                rend="italic">29</hi>], 1 p.m. The Inspector General of Customs has
                            supplied me with copies of an exchange of telegrams between himself and
                            the Minister of Finance regarding the August 1938 installment of the
                            Reorganization loan due July 18 and amounting to some 124,000 pounds.
                            The Inspector General was directed on July 14 to again negotiate with
                            the Japanese authorities direct for approval of the withdrawal from the
                            Shanghai customs revenue deposited with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank
                            of the amount needed to make up the difference between the percentage
                            allotted by the Ministry of Finance for payment from the revenues of the
                            unoccupied ports and the total amount due. It will be recalled that
                            Japanese consent was obtained for such action on the July installment.
                            The Japanese authorities, however, declined to consider the question of
                            advancing loan quotas or to again consent to the payment of loan quotas
                            from the deposits in the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banks unless the
                            Anglo-Japanese customs arrangement was implemented especially with
                            respect to the payment of the Japanese Boxer indemnity and the transfer
                            to the Yokohama Specie Bank of revenue balances now lying in the Hong

                        <p>551. 1. At the suggestion of the Consul General at Shanghai this office
                            asked Chefoo to investigate reported attempt to place Chefoo Harbor
                            Commission under Provisional Government authority. The following is
                            Chefoo’s reply: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“September 3, 2 p.m. Referring to the Embassy’s telegram of
                                    September 1, I learn quite confidentially from a reliable source
                                    the Japanese Consul at Chefoo has been discreetly approaching
                                    certain members of the Chefoo Harbor Improvement Commission
                                    seeking a means of placing the Harbor Commission under the
                                    puppet mayor of Chefoo. Their efforts already dominate the
                                    Chefoo Harbor Commission controlling the votes of the
                                    Superintendent of Customs, the Acting Commissioner Customs, the
                                    representative of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the
                                    Japanese Consul. The consular body at Chefoo would [not?] oppose
                                    the Japanese move to place the Commission under the puppet
                                    municipal authorities at Chefoo unless the diplomatic
                                    representatives of Norway, Netherlands, Finland and Italy
                                    instruct their Consuls to vote against the Japanese.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>2. We suggest instructing Chefoo as follows: <pb n="739" xml:id="pg_739"
                                facs="0743"/>

                                <p>“The Chefoo Harbor Commission was created in 1913 by the
                                    diplomatic body at Peiping and the Chinese Foreign Office and
                                    any proposed change in its status must properly be agreed upon
                                    by the powers concerned. Thus the question of placing the
                                    Commission under the mayor’s office does not fall within the
                                    competence of the Commission. The activities of the Japanese
                                    Consul, who is the consular representative on the Commission,
                                    would seem to be irregular unless undertaken at the instance of
                                    the consular body acting under instructions of the interested
                                    diplomatic representatives. Please consult your interested

                        <p>The Provisional Government authorities and the Japanese Naval authorities
                            at 7:30 last night convened the Chefoo Harbor Improvement Commission and
                            read a proclamation taking over the Harbor Commission and its property
                            for the Provisional Government. The Harbor Commission by a vote of 4 to
                            1 dissolved itself. The Japanese Consul as representative of the
                            Consular Corps on the Commission cast his vote to dissolve Commission
                            without consulting Consular Corps. At 11 this morning Japanese naval
                            officers called to inform me that the premises now leased by the United
                            States from the Harbor Commission as United States Consulate have been
                            taken over by the Japanese naval authorities.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            Number 1639 of September 2, 1938,<note n="16" xml:id="d796fn16">Not

                                >Neither printed.</note> addressed to me under date of September 12,
                            1938, by the Inspector General of Customs with regard to the urgency of
                            an early implementation of the Anglo-Japanese Customs Arrangement.</p>
                        <p>While the Inspector General has long been known to favor the early
                            implementation of the Customs arrangement this is the first time that he
                            has, to my knowledge, advocated so forcefully its immediate
                            implementation or pointed out so boldly that Japan has already secured
                                <pb n="741" xml:id="pg_741" facs="0745"/>the major advantages she
                            might expect to receive from the arrangement and that financially China
                            has much to gain and little or nothing to lose by its implementation at
                            the present time.</p>
                        <p>In the face of repeated Japanese warnings that they intend to treat the
                            deposits of Customs revenues now in Japanese banks, after deduction of
                            Customs local expenses, as surplus, the Inspector General calls
                            attention to the danger that Japan will use these deposits as security
                            to obtain immediate cash advances.</p>
                        <p>While the implementation of the agreement would unquestionably tend to
                            strengthen and regularize the position of the Chinese Maritime Customs
                            staff operating in Japanese controlled areas, this office is not yet
                            convinced that the Chinese Government does not intend to use its failure
                            to receive revenues from the Japanese occupied areas as an excuse for
                            the declaration of a complete or partial moratorium on the payment of
                            amortization and perhaps even of interest on Chinese Government loans.
                            Moreover, under the present conditions the fact that the arrangement
                            envisages the provision of foreign exchange by the Chinese Government to
                            cover all out-payments from loan quota funds received by it in Chinese
                            national currency might be regarded as a disadvantage outweighing any
                            advantages which it could expect to receive from the implementation of
                            the agreement.</p>

                        <p>1339. Inspector General of Customs informs me confidentially that he is
                            sending a message to the Minister of Finance through the British Embassy
                            substantially as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The extension of the occupied areas has automatically increased
                                    the financial strain on China in respect of obligations secured
                                    on the customs and unless a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>
                                    on the lines of the proposals set forth in the so-called
                                    Anglo-Japanese understanding is found, the drain on China’s
                                    reserves will not diminish during hostilities and will probably
                                    be increased. The Minister has already instructed the Inspector
                                    General to keep informed the interested powers (America, Great
                                    Britain <pb n="744" xml:id="pg_744" facs="0748"/>and France) and
                                    while executing these instructions he has been instructed to
                                    take no action likely in his judgment to be prejudicial to
                                    China’s prestige or interest. As Your Excellency is aware, the
                                    interested powers are unanimous in advocating the paramount
                                    importance of maintaining the integrity of the service, in order
                                    to preserve as far as possible the various interests connected
                                    with Chinese and foreign trade, shipping and finance. The
                                    Inspector General thinks that in endeavoring to conform with
                                    this policy, a somewhat wider latitude in giving effect to the
                                    suggestions of the powers in connection with the adjustment by
                                    the customs of the service of the loans, et cetera, secured on
                                    the customs should not be opposed. If the advice of the powers
                                    in this connection is followed, the release of the accumulated
                                    Shanghai revenue now lying in the Hong Kong Bank would in effect
                                    be merely a book transaction, since the quotas due from the
                                    occupied areas for loan payments, et cetera, exceed the present
                                    balance by about 10 million dollars; and as regards the
                                    indemnity balance in commerce (pounds sterling 420,000, that is
                                    about 7 million dollars) it has already been suggested that this
                                    could possibly be adjusted by a reduction in the sum due from
                                    the occupied areas leaving the sterling balance in the Hong Kong
                                    Bank, provided, of course, that the Japanese authorities would
                                    accept such a plan. If some such arrangement could now be
                                    effected locally, the Inspector General considers that the
                                    financial interests of the Government would be better preserved
                                    for the time being.”</p>

                            <item>As Japanese military operations have now in effect closed the port
                                of Canton and the principal customs revenue ports are now in
                                Japanese hands, the question of the integrity of the customs and the
                                question of foreign loans and indemnities secured from customs are
                                becoming increasingly serious. The Chinese Government having failed
                                to accept the Anglo-Japanese customs arrangement or to authorize the
                                Inspector General of Customs to exercise a discretion which might
                                permit him in effect to implement that authority without formal
                                approval, we find a situation in which all customs revenues are
                                passing into Japanese control and there is no release of any funds
                                for loan and indemnity payments. More serious perhaps is the danger
                                of complete disruption of the present more or less international
                                character of the customs service. I am informed that certain foreign
                                advisers of the Ministry of Finance and certain elements of the
                                Chinese Government favor the withdrawal of the Customs
                                Administration from all Japanese occupied ports. If this should be
                                ordered or if the Japanese should take the position that China
                                having or [<hi rend="italic">now?</hi>] failed [to] accept the
                                Anglo-Japanese arrangement, Japan <pb n="745" xml:id="pg_745"
                                    facs="0749"/>is under no obligation further to respect the
                                existing Customs Administration, we would soon find a situation
                                similar to that in Manchuria where the customs is under complete
                                Japanese domination and control to the disadvantage of other foreign
                                trade and interests. From the purely selfish standpoint of the
                                interests of our trade it seems to me that we should do whatever we
                                can to guard against such a calamity.</item>

                        <p>1350. In a confidential letter received today from the Inspector General
                            of Customs he points out that in view of the imminent fall of Hankow and
                            Canton it is expected that Japan will adopt a still stronger and more
                            aggressive attitude in conjunction with the Chinese Customs
                            Administration and through the medium of the “Reformed Government” may
                            insist upon dominating the policy of Inspectorate General. He argues
                            that should such a situation arise it would be detrimental to Chinese
                            and foreign commercial shipping and financial interests in China. He
                            states that treaties and circumstances have invested the Inspectorate
                            General with an international character and have charged the Customs
                            Administration with various responsibilities not usually undertaken by
                            customs authorities elsewhere. These responsibilities provide for
                            uniformity of tariff rates and equality of fiscal treatment; for the
                            maintenance of the Open Door policy; for the administration of the
                            Lighthouse and Harbor Department; and for the service of domestic and
                            foreign loans. In order to protect these responsibilites, in the opinion
                            of the Inspector General, an essential preliminary is the preservation
                            of the integrity of the service and the continuation of the existing
                            [Inspectorate?] system on broad international lines with equal
                            facilities, without discrimination, for all. He therefore suggests that
                            the interested powers may consider it expedient at the present juncture
                            to issue a further statement <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746" facs="0750"/>to
                            the effect that they expect the integrity of the customs and the
                            existing constitution of the Inspectorate to be maintained. He believes
                            that the general customs position would thus be strengthened.</p>

                        <p>504. Shanghai’s 1339, October 16, 12 noon. While we have on appropriate
                            occasion expressed to both the Chinese and to the Japanese Governments
                            our concern for the preservation of the Chinese Maritime Customs
                            Administration we have not offered the Chinese Government any advice as
                            to providing for specific method of achieving that end. I for my part
                            perceive no new reason why we should at this time depart from that
                            policy.</p>

                            might do more harm than good. We believe that such a statement would be

                            of the customs is taken by the Japanese authorities or by the “Reformed

                            Commission. Note dated October 28 from the Chinese Foreign Office quotes
                            communication from the Ministry of Finance reporting transfer of the
                            Commission to the control of the Japanese Navy and asserting that the
                            Commission should not be subject to interference by any party without
                            the agreement of the Chinese Government and of the powers concerned. The
                            Ministry of Foreign Affairs asks that the Department conduct
                            negotiations with the Japanese to stop these activities. Note indicates
                            that similar representations have been made to the British and French
                            Embassies. I have replied that the contents of the note have been

                            Customs. The Department has received from the British Embassy at
                            Washington an <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> over date October
                                29<note n="22" xml:id="d806fn22">Not printed.</note> containing
                            information substantially in accord with that contained in your telegram
                            under reference and saying in addition that the Inspector General of
                            Customs has received information that the Japanese Government intends in
                            the immediate future to demand a considerable increase in the Japanese
                            personnel of the Chinese customs service. The British Embassy suggests
                            that in such event it might be helpful if the interested powers were to
                            make parallel representations to the effect that while increases in the
                            Japanese personnel in the customs <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748"

                            conditions, to determine whether such increase is desirable.</p>
                        <p>The Department has replied that it concurs in the views expressed by you
                            in your telegram under reference but that it would prefer to await
                            further Japanese demands upon the customs before reaching a definite
                            decision in regard to appropriate action to meet such demands. The
                            Department added, however, that it was inclined to agree in principle
                            that parallel representations by the interested governments might be
                            desirable if and when the Japanese authorities or a regime supported by
                            them take steps in derogation of the integrity of the Chinese Maritime
                            Customs.</p>

                        <p>1. Under date November 9 the American Consul General at Canton
                            telegraphed as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Japanese consular and military authorities today went to the
                                    Canton Customhouse and informed the Acting Deputy Commissioner
                                    in charge that they were taking over the Chinese Maritime
                                    Customs as from 2 p.m., today.</p>
                                <p>For the present the Japanese flag will not be flown nor must any
                                    other flag. The present customs staff is asked to continue as
                                    before but documents must be shown to the Japanese authorities
                                    when asked for. They added that no customs funds now owing or
                                    here in banks may be transferred to the Inspector General
                                    without their permission. The Deputy Commissioner has asked the
                                    Inspector General at Shanghai for instructions.”</p>

                        <p>2. The Department authorizes you, if and when your interested colleagues
                            are prepared to take similar but separate action, to protest to the
                            Japanese Foreign Office in such manner as you may deem appropriate
                            against the taking over of the Chinese Maritime Customshouse at Canton
                            by the Japanese authorities. You should base your representations on the
                            ground that the reported action constitutes an infringement of the
                            integrity of the Chinese Maritime Customs and you should reexpress the
                            broad interest which this Government has in the preservation of the
                            integrity of the customs.<note n="23" xml:id="d809fn23">For Ambassador

                        <p>Subsequent to the date upon which representations were made in Tokyo, the
                            American Government received information from the American Consul
                            General at Canton to the effect that the control over the Chinese
                            customs at Canton contemplated by the Japanese authorities is similar to
                            that exercised by the Japanese at other ports under the control of the
                            Japanese military and that the Commissioner of Customs at Canton has
                            accepted the situation under protest. The American Government continues
                            to maintain its interest in the preservation of the integrity of the
                            Chinese Maritime Customs but, in the <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752"
                                facs="0756"/>absence of information indicating that additional
                            action would be advisable, it does not perceive that any beneficial
                            purpose would be served by its making further representations to the
                            Japanese Government in this matter at this time.</p>
