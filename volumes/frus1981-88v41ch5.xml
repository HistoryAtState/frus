                    1981–1989, Volume XLI</p>
                <p>In preparing this volume, the editors made extensive use of Presidential papers
                    and other White House records at the Reagan Library. Within the Reagan Library’s
                    collection, <persName corresp="#p_GMA_1">Michael Guhin</persName>’s files, the
                    National Security Council Subject File, <persName corresp="#p_BRC_2">Ralph
                        Bledsoe</persName>’s records of the Domestic Policy Council, and a copy of
                    the <persName corresp="#p_SGP_1">George P. Shultz</persName> Papers organized by
                    subject were the most helpful.</p>
                <p>The records of the Department of State were another important source. The
                    Department’s central files contain both cable traffic as well as key memoranda.
                    The Department’s lot files were particularly useful, especially when looking for
                    inter-bureau memoranda regarding whaling, the ozone layer, <gloss
                        target="#t_AIDS_2">AIDS</gloss>, and population control. Two Assistant
                    Secretaries of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, <persName
                        corresp="#p_AE_1">Elliott Abrams</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SR_1"
                        >Richard Schifter</persName>, both have voluminous lot files. The lot files
                    for Deputy Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_CWP_1">William Clark</persName>,
                        <persName corresp="#p_DKW_1">Kenneth Dam</persName>, and <persName
                        corresp="#p_WJC_1">John Whitehead</persName> contained valuable
                    documentation.</p>
                <p>Research for this volume also involved examining records from the Department of
                    Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the
                    Vice Presidential Materials at the <persName corresp="#p_BGHW_1">George H.W.
                        Bush</persName> Library. Some material from the Agency for International
                    Development is already declassified and available at the National Archives and
                    Records Administration at College Park in Record Group 286. The Office of the
                    Historian was also able to gain access to the <persName corresp="#p_HAM_1"
                        >Alexander M. Haig</persName> Papers at the Library of Congress.</p>
                <p>Researchers will find records in Department of State lot files helpful. Lot
                    90D327 contains most of the records from the United Nations Third World
                    Conference on Women in Nairobi, and Lot 92D207 has several boxes with
                    information about the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                    administration’s policy regarding acid rain.</p>
                <p>Almost all of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of the
                    agencies mentioned, the assistance of their staffs, and especially the
                    cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>In addition to the paper files cited below, a growing number of documents are
                    available on the Internet. The Office of the Historian maintains a list of these
                    Internet resources on its website and encourages readers to consult that site on
                    a regular basis.</p>

                                target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Population Commission ended today with
                            achievement of U.S. objectives and passage of substantive resolution on
                            strengthening actions concerned with fulfillment of the World Population
                            Plan of Action (introduced by the U.S. and co-sponsored by France,
                            Greece, Indonesia, Norway, and Thailand), and on convening a World
                            Population Conference in 1984 (introduced by Egypt and co-sponsored by
                            France, Greece, India, Indonesia, Japan, Morocco, Netherlands, Nigeria,
                            Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, and Zaire). A dominant theme of eight-day
                            meeting was surprisingly strong and broadly based <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss> emphasis on adverse effects of high
                            fertility on economic and social development and need for actions to
                            reduce excessive population growth; unexpectedly, a Nigerian Cabinet
                            Minister was among the most eloquent and powerful speakers on these
                            lines. In contrast, the Soviet Union, supported by the Ukraine and, less
                            prominently by Hungary, made persistent efforts to remove reference to
                            excessive population growth and fertility in commission reports and
                            resolutions. In the end, the Soviet Union was, to its evident
                            embarassment, isolated with the Ukraine (Hungary not being present) in
                            being formally recorded as not joining in the Commission’s consensus on
                            the two substantive resolutions.</p>
                        <p>3. As reported in ref. A, the resolution on the International Population
                            Conference, together with the accompanying Commission report to <gloss
                                target="#t_ECOSOC_1">ECOSOC</gloss>, contained all U.S. points
                            regarding magnitude and <pb facs="0769" n="723" xml:id="pg_723"/>
                            urgency of population problem at national, regional, and global levels,
                            emphasis on limitation of conference to selected population issues of
                            highest priority, necessity for minimizing cost of conference, and role
                            for <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss> in conference. Resolution,
                            as approved today, is virtually identical to text in ref. A, with
                            omission of operative para. 5 at U.S. suggestion, in accordance with
                            U.S. position on similar clauses from other <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                >UN</gloss> subsidiary bodies.<note n="3" xml:id="d260fn3">Operative
                                paragraph 5 discussed the financing of the conference.</note> U.S.
                            Representative (<persName corresp="#p_BRE_1">Benedick</persName>)
                            delivered formal statement noting that U.S. support is contingent with
                            the understandings relating to economizing the cost of the conference
                            and the major focus on problems of population growth. He stressed that
                                <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> will monitor carefully all
                            preparations for this conference in light of these criteria.</p>
                        <p>4. Resolution concerning strengthening of actions in fulfillment of the
                            World Population Plan of Action, introduced at U.S. initiative, stressed
                            (over Soviet objections) that the population factor is a central element
                            to any strategy designed to improve quality of life. Resolution urged
                            that relevant international conferences and international instruments
                            give full consideration to population factors, and called upon <gloss
                                target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss>, FAO, World Bank, etc., to integrate
                            population more fully into their work programs and deliberations. A new
                            element in this resolution was an operative paragraph urging
                            international organizations, including <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1"
                                >UNFPA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_WHO_1">WHO</gloss>, and
                            national governments to give high priority to research on human
                            reproduction and the development of more acceptable, safer, and more
                            effective means of fertility regulation; this clause reinforces the
                            mandate of <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss> in this important,
                            and relatively neglected, area.</p>
                        <p>5. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1">USSR</gloss> Delegation, evidently
                            acting on rigid instructions, clearly swam against the mainstream of the
                            Commission. This was epitomized in a heavy-handed attempt this morning
                            to block Commission consideration of the two substantive resolutions. A
                            new spokesman replaced the Soviet and Ukraine demographer
                            representatives and argued that the Commission had violated Rule 52
                            requiring 24-hour advance notice in submission of resolution texts.
                            Chairman (W. Weerasooria, Sri Lanka), supported by the Secretary
                            (Agbasyo, Nigeria, <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC_1">ECOSOC</gloss>), reminded
                            Soviets that Rule 52 had been suspended earlier by the Commission
                            without debate. This had evidently slipped by the Soviets who, supported
                            by the Ukraine and Hungary, continued to insist that they could not
                            discuss the resolutions. Following interventions by Egypt, Netherlands,
                            U.S., Norway, and Indonesia, the chairman ruled against <gloss

                            the Commission, a charge which brought strong reactions from both the
                            Chairman and the Indian Representative.</p>

                            <p rend="center">SOME NOTES ON WORLD POPULATION GROWTH</p>
                            <p>—There is no precedent in the history of mankind for the numbers
                                being added to the world’s population: between now and the end of
                                the century, the world’s population will probably grow from the
                                current 4.4 billion to over 6 billion—an increase in only 20 years
                                which is almost as much as the entire world population as recently
                                as 1930. Ninety percent of this growth will occur in the low-income
                                countries.</p>
                            <p>—These factors are condemning hundreds of millions of people—chiefly
                                women and children—to lives of physical and spiritual degradation,
                                and often mental retardation. World Health Organization studies
                                demonstrate that the health of mothers and children is adversely
                                affected by pregnancies too early and too late in life, by close
                                spacing of children, and by higher numbers of births (beyond three).
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNICEF_1">UNICEF</gloss> reports that millions
                                of unwanted children are being abandoned each year by
                                parents—especially in Latin America—to lives of vice and misery on
                                the streets.</p>
                            <p>—There is a built-in momentum to this population growth which compels
                                a sense of urgency to attempts to address the problem. Consider, for
                                example, Mexico, with a 1975 population of under 70 million: If a
                                two-child family norm could be achieved by the year 2000, Mexico’s
                                population would still continue to grow for several decades, before
                                stabilizing at around 175 million. If, however, the two-child norm
                                were reached only 20 years later (i.e., by 2020), demographic
                                momentum would carry the eventual stabilized population to
                                approximately 270 million!</p>
                            <p>—It is open to question whether the population of this planet may
                                stabilize at 9–10 billion, or at 12 billion or more. In a world
                                characterized by growing scarcities and strains on biological and
                                environmental systems, numbers such as these have portentous
                                implications for the future of mankind—perhaps for the very survival
                                of the human race. It is not primarily a problem of distribution;
                                countries cannot achieve meaningful economic and social development
                                when they are on a treadmill, struggling to provide the basic
                                necessities of existence to constantly growing numbers of
                                people.</p>
                            <p>—At this stage in human evolution, survival of the human race is no
                                longer menaced, as in the historical past, by too few numbers. <pb
                                    facs="0773" n="727" xml:id="pg_727"/> Indeed, the wholly modern
                                pressure of population begins to affect delicate balances in the
                                environment, and to conflict with our responsibility for stewardship
                                of the earth.</p>
                            <p>—Under these circumstances, moral issues of past centuries bear
                                re-examination. It may, for example, be asked whether the human
                                race, taken as a whole, has a moral right to continue procreating in
                                a way which threatens the opportunity for future generations to
                                achieve human dignity and justice and to realize their spiritual
                                potential.</p>
                            <p>—As expressed by Pope John Paul II in <hi rend="italic">Redemptor
                                    Hominis</hi>,<note n="5" xml:id="d261fn5">See John Paul II, <hi

                                    March 4, 1979.</note> the Catholic Church has a transcendent
                                role in looking beyond the immediate future, to the coming
                                millenium, in searching for ways to conserve the environment and to
                                secure the dignity of man and the education of the generations to
                                come. Therefore, the Church is in a unique position to offer a
                                positive and realistic response to the major social and human issues
                                of our day.</p>
                            <p>—The Catholic Church’s position with respect to the modern phenomenon
                                of population growth thus has important implications for its
                                teaching mission, for its role in the ecumenical movement, for the
                                conditions of life of hundreds of millions of women and children,
                                and for future generations on this planet. In the sacrament of
                                marriage, the conscientious choice of fewer children may be seen not
                                as selfishness, but rather as responsible parenthood: increasing the
                                capability of fathers and mothers to bestow more attention,
                                spiritual guidance, education, time, and love on each individual
                                child—as well as contributing to the greater good of humanity on a
                                finite planet.</p>
                            <p>—Natural family planning, while an ideal method in many respects, may
                                not be effective or feasible in every situation. It seems reasonable
                                to respect the motivation and conscience of husbands and wives in
                                choosing the number of their offspring, within a modern context of
                                human dignity and reverence for life. Under these circumstances, as
                                in other areas of morality recognized in Church teachings,
                                scientifically approved means of fertility regulation may come to be
                                regarded as the lesser of two evils.</p>
                            <p>—The United States, although a secular state, shares many of the
                                concerns of the Church in looking toward a future of hope and better
                                life for the coming generations. On a planet of finite resources, we
                                will all face unprecedented dilemmas in the future. We welcome a
                                dialogue on these fundamental issues, including economic and social
                                development, maternal and child health, excessive population growth,
                                rapid urbanization, problems of the aged, etc.</p>

                                for U.S. foreign policy objectives of peace and stability, the State
                                Department was assigned, by President Nixon, the central

                                covers assistance to governments in establishing and implementing
                                population/family planning programs, training, commodities, and
                                research—has been stagnating since 1979 at around $200 million
                                annually, or about five percent of total U.S. foreign aid. This has
                                meant serious cuts, in real terms, in many valuable programs, coming
                                ironically at a time when <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s are
                                increasingly recognizing the need to limit population growth.</p>

                                1983, the Department should pressure <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                    >AID</gloss> to accord highest priority to population
                                assistance, without which other aid is undercut by the effects of
                                rapid population growth.</p>

                            <p>The leading multilateral agency, with a current program of about $150
                                million ($32 million from the U.S.), faces similar problems of
                                flagging donor support and inability to meet growing <gloss
                                    target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss> requests for assistance. A problem
                                here is within <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>: at a time of
                                budget stringency, there are strong pressures to divert resources
                                from <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss> to bilateral programs.
                                A strong multilateral agency is important to us, because it can
                                operate in countries where bilateral population programs might be
                                too sensitive, and because of its multiplier effect as the major
                                channel for other donors’ support. We are currently engaged with
                                    <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> in an appraisal of <gloss

                                be head of the U.S. delegation at this meeting.)</p>
                            <p>—We need to complete this exercise, ensure a fair share for <gloss

                                programs, and encourage support of other donors.</p>

                            <p>Deficiencies of existing methods of regulating fertility from the
                                standpoints of safety, acceptability, and effectiveness lead to high
                                discontinuance rates, which substantially offset the efforts
                                expended on motivation for smaller families and on provision of a
                                service delivery infrastructure. Yet, global expenditures for
                                research in reproduction—mostly in the U.S.—are also stagnating, and
                                amount to only one or two percent of total biomedical research—which
                                bears no relation to the potential benefits of a breakthrough in
                                this field. It is imperative to increase research funding in order
                                to expand the options, follow up on currently promising leads, adapt
                                existing methods to the particular physiological and social
                                circumstances of <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s, and attract
                                high-quality scientific talent to the field. Private industry cannot
                                be expected to fill the gap because of the unprofitability of an
                                “ideal contraceptive.”</p>

                            <p>Over a year ago, with the support of U.S. Special Envoy Robert

                                theologians, I initiated a dialogue on population with Vatican
                                officials. These discussions, which have reached high policy levels,
                                including the Foreign Minister, Cardinals, and Bishops, have been
                                cordially received, and the Vatican has welcomed exchange of
                                demographic and scientific material and a continuation of contacts;
                                last September, I also left with the Vatican an informal <hi

                                which was favorably noted by the Vatican. Further cooperation with

                                objectives, as an effective way of reaching national leadership.
                                Recently, Ambassador (Ret.) Marshall Green, as a consultant to the
                                Department, made a RAPID presentation to President Sadat and
                                elicited from President Zia a request for preparation of one for
                                Pakistan. Nigeria and Kenya also appear to be at a watershed in
                                their official attitude toward population growth; RAPID programs are
                                under preparation. We plan to follow up on and reinforce these

                            implications of such statements, and therefore I want to take this

                        <p>4. Rapid population growth is a major obstacle to social and economic
                            progress in the developing world. Ninety percent of world population
                            growth between now and the end of the century will occur in the less
                            developed regions of the world. Concommitant with population growth are
                            food scarcities and increasing malnutrition, depletion of natural
                            resources and degradation of the productive environment, growing
                            unemployment and underemployment, urban crowding and severe housing
                            shortages, and the diversion of resources from investment to support the
                            growing population.</p>
                        <p>5. A.I.D. has been the leader in developing and disseminating the most
                            widely used contraceptive methods; in developing low-cost service
                            delivery systems; in training personnel; in increasing interest in
                            family planning among individuals, communities, and national leaders;
                            and in promoting multilateral assistance for population through the
                                <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss>, and other institutions,
                            which have attracted funds from other donors to this area. I feel
                            strongly that we must continue to provide strong leadership, especially
                            now when (1) demand for population programs from a wide range of
                            countries far exceeds available resources, (2) diplomatic pressure from
                            developing countries for more attention to population is rising, and (3)
                            confidence in and demand for U.S. expertise in population programs is
                            growing.</p>
                        <p>6. The basic objective of A.I.D.’s population program has been and will
                            continue to be to encourage voluntary family planning. Over the past
                            fifteen years we have developed a much sharper appreciation of the
                            complex social and economic factors that encourage high fertility, of
                            the negative impact that rapid population growth has on a country’s
                            economic development, and of the political, economic, social, and policy
                            changes that are supportive of fertility declines.</p>
                        <p>7. In the past, A.I.D.’s major population programs have concentrated on
                            those countries where the government has been strongly supportive of
                            family planning and often where generally improving economic and social
                            conditions have encouraged interest in smaller families. While funding
                            will continue to be concentrated in those countries where the potential
                            for successful family planning programs has already been demonstrated,
                            we should be giving increasing attention to opportunities in other
                            countries where birth rates remain unusually high. In looking to the
                            challenges ahead, we will give greater attention to such innovative
                            programs as:</p>

                            growth are becoming increasingly obvious, and when we know, by and
                            large, how to design effective population programs appropriate to

                        <p>9. In short, I urge you to reassure Mission staff working in all sectors,
                            local population and family planning groups, and host country
                            counterparts that the U.S. does not intend to diminish its commitment to
                            and leadership in international population programs. The fact that this
                            administration’s FY 1982 budget request of dols. 253.4 million for
                            population represents a one-third increase, at a time of severe
                            budgetary stringency and cutback of many domestic and international
                            programs, speaks for itself.</p>

                            during the Carter Administration, but the interagency coordinating

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> budget for population assistance
                            was increased from about $200M in FY 81 to $250M for FY 82. However,
                            this increase should be viewed in context. The <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> budget remained essentially constant for FY 79, FY 80,
                            and FY 81 under continuing resolutions in the absence of a Foreign
                            Assistance Act for those years. All of <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> has been increased in FY 82 to account for the steady
                            decline in real terms over the last three years. The percentage increase
                            for population assistance is slightly larger than the increase for
                                <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> as a whole, but these programs
                            are still only a small percent of <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>’s
                            effort (around 7%).</p>
                        <p>Why more money? As noted, it is not an increase in real terms over FY 79.
                            Also, the problem is still growing. While the growth rate <pb
                                facs="0783" n="737" xml:id="pg_737"/> is down, there is a larger
                            population base. Some key <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s and
                            others have a strong interest in population programs (e.g., Indonesia,
                            Mexico, Thailand, Turkey, Egypt, Tunisia). An international consensus is
                            growing on the importance of population programs to other interests,
                            particularly development efforts. Finally, population assistance and
                            programs can be effective when combined with other development efforts,
                            as seen in some of the countries mentioned above as well as in China and
                            South Korea.</p>
                        <p>What about domestic political implications? That is not my call. However,
                            there has been support for this aspect of <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> in Congress and, I understand, no significant
                            opposition to the programs. (The FY 82 budget was increased in one house
                            and decreased in the other, so it appears it may end up right around the
                            Administration proposal.) Also, there is no abortion work. The <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJA_1">Helms</persName> amendment a few years ago made
                            clear that there would be no kind of assistance to abortion.<note n="6"

                            deal with effects of bad practice). Finally, this is not “taking on” the
                            “Catholic Church.” In fact, there are ongoing consultations with the

                            programs. This, combined with what they see as a decision by the
                            Administration to avoid mention of population in the Ottawa
                                Communique,<note n="8" xml:id="d263fn8">Reference is to the G–7
                                Summit held in Ottawa in July 1981.</note> is resulting in some
                            concern about where the Administration is heading on international
                            population programs.</p>
                        <p>My view is fairly simple. We need to get on with international population
                            programs for our security and other interests, in conjunction with our
                            other development programs. The increase makes as much sense as the
                                <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> effort overall, if not more
                            sense than some aspects. If we do not want to give high political
                            visibility to these programs, that is one thing and we can accommodate
                            our public tactics accordingly. However, I believe that this concern
                            should not affect the support for the programs and that it would be very
                            unfortunate to create an impression that the Administration is not for
                            international population assistance.</p>

                            “Population” title is that it permits other governments to work
                            cooperatively with our programs on important issues that relate to
                            family planning without committing themselves specifically or solely to

                        <p>It has been a while since your visit to Athens,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d266fn2">Not further identified.</note> and I am delighted
                            that you are back in Government in such a vitally important role.
                            Marshall Green has told me of the luncheon meeting with you last week,
                            and of the discussion on the importance of global and regional
                            population developments to U.S. foreign policy and national
                            security.</p>
                        <p>As you may know, since <persName corresp="#p_MHR_1">Marshall</persName>’s
                            retirement in 1979, I have taken over the population policy portfolio, a
                            fascinating job that has involved me in areas ranging from biomedical
                            research to moral theology.</p>

                            population growth and potential instability in key areas of interest to

                                1900.<note n="4" xml:id="d266fn4">See Goldstone, “The Comparative

                        <p>As <persName corresp="#p_MHR_1">Marshall</persName> has probably told
                            you, I and others are concerned that the “moral majority” issues may be
                            exerting an unwarranted spillover on U.S. policies and programs in this
                            area. Notwithstanding the excellent statement on population in the

                                (accessed online)</note> there is a definite reluctance in some
                            Washington quarters to recognize the importance of population factors,
                            and the urgency for actions to address them—both in our aid programs and
                            in biomedical research into better and safer methods of fertility
                            regulation. We have not, for example, been able to include population as

                                xml:id="d266fn7">Reference is to the Cancun Summit on International

                            information that a number of other world leaders—including Kreisky,
                            Gandhi, <persName corresp="#p_SJR_2">Schmidt</persName>, <persName

                                >Lopez</persName> Portillo and Zhao—will raise the subject.</p>
                        <p>Even in some academic circles, it has become suddenly fashionable to
                            state that the “population problem” is an invention of doomsayers, that
                            family planning is a form of left-wing “social engineering,” and that
                            the world will somehow come up with a technological quick-fix (a new
                                <persName corresp="#p_GGS_1">Green</persName> Revolution, space
                            colonization, etc.). These arguments are seductive in their optimism and
                            conducive to a “do-nothing” posture, especially in an atmosphere where
                            budgets must be slashed.</p>
                        <p>The argument has weak intellectual underpinnings, ignoring the effects of
                            population growth in diverting resources from investment to consumption,
                            the costs of job creation, diminishing land productivity, and the
                            political and social fallout from massive urbanization, unemployed
                            youth, etc. One cannot effectively implement global “supply side
                            economics” without paying attention to the demand side. Especially at a
                            time of budget cutting, population assistance should stand out for its
                            inherent cost-effectiveness in terms of the entire development
                            process.</p>
                        <p>Experience has shown that population programs can work, even in the
                            relatively short run, and a large number of <gloss target="#t_LDC_1"
                                >LDC</gloss> leaders have expressed themselves publicly on this
                            issue. Even the Catholic Church does not have a closed mind; enclosed is

                            toward international population issues; assessed the policy itself;
                            evaluated the nature and forms of foreign assistance devoted to such
                            matters; and developed the recommendations below. These address policy,
                            structure, and resources.</p>
                        <p>In brief, I conclude:</p>
                        <p>—that economic growth is a far more important factor in bringing about a
                            decline in fertility than are specifically targeted population control
                            programs of negative restraint;</p>
                        <p>—that foreign governments must, if population measures are to be
                            effective, adopt and execute them of their own free will, and that one
                            measure of the real priority they attach to such programs is their
                            willingness to devote resources (including those derived from
                            international donors) to them;</p>
                        <p>—that we should engage in no international programs in the population
                            field which would be unacceptable here at home;</p>
                        <p>—that our policy should thus be directed at encouraging economic
                            development broadly, with appropriate attention to the role of family
                            planning in meeting maternal and child health goals, with the receiving
                            government deciding on the emphasis, if any, to be given population
                            control programs within that framework; and</p>
                        <p>—that the department’s organizational structure should be changed to
                            reflect this redirection of policy.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">BACKGROUND</p>
                        <p>Over the past fifteen years, the United States Government has expended
                            over $1.5 billion for advocacy and financing of population control
                            programs overseas. This sum represents more than fifty percent of all
                            population control expenditures from all sources. In fiscal year 1982
                            alone, $211 million are budgeted for this purpose. This mammoth effort
                            has helped to produce the present, widespread global consciousness of
                            population issues. Insofar as that was our original objective, this
                            effort has been enormously successful, to the point where <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> states that the demand for this form
                            of assistance exceeds the Agency’s ability to provide it.</p>
                        <p>In recent years, however, the Government’s direct financing of population
                            control activities has become increasingly controversial. It has been
                            challenged on ethical grounds by certain groups, and on far broader
                            policy grounds by academicians and scholars who question the fundamental
                            assumptions underlying those activities, and hence their effectiveness
                            in achieving their stated goals. Whether the subject is the propriety or
                            the effectiveness of our expenditures for population control, however,
                            passions run high on both sides. On purely intellectual grounds,
                            conclusive proof seems to be lacking either way.</p>
                        <p>At the very least, we should be more aware now than we were fifteen years
                            ago that population control programs address what are, in essence, the
                            symptoms of economic dysfunction. In the shorter run, they are not
                            curative of economic ills, but palliative at best, although some critics
                            would deny even that benefit. Some contend that larger family size is an
                            incentive to the industry and investment which help a society achieve
                            the economic breakthrough that, experience suggests, will be the most
                            certain cause of a decline in fertility. Others argue that large numbers
                            of children divert resources away from the kinds of investment which
                            foster economic growth. Whatever else may be said about these
                            controversies, U.S. Government policy cannot settle them.</p>
                        <p>Despite such profound disagreements, there is a broad consensus,
                            including the less doctrinaire exponents of population control,
                            concerning the following propositions:</p>
                        <p>—Development assistance provided by the U.S. Government is only part of
                            the financial resources expended for economic and social advancement
                            within a particular country. Therefore, a decision by the United States
                            to limit or terminate a specific kind of assistance does not preclude
                            the host country, or other aid providers, from expending funds for that
                            purpose, if they really want to do so.</p>
                        <p>—As <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> acknowledges, population control
                            expenditures are wasted where the host country is not seriously
                            committed to the reduction of fertility as a national priority.</p>
                        <pb facs="0793" n="747" xml:id="pg_747"/>
                        <p>—U.S. population control programs should not be forced on anyone, and
                            should not directly or indirectly finance or support abortion or
                            research or lobbying concerning abortion. In the past, U.S.
                            aggressiveness in promoting population control has created a hostile
                            backlash in certain societies. <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>
                            asserts this situation has been corrected. This is certainly the
                            intention of the present <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>
                            administration, but the risk is pointless if the same objectives can be
                            gained without it.</p>
                        <p>—Certain population control strategies supported by U.S. funds would be
                            unacceptable in the United States. It is doubtful whether the public or
                            their elected leaders would approve, on a case by case basis, U.S.
                            financing of the Indonesian village system (using peer pressure to force
                            couples to avoid births in order to protect bonuses awarded to
                            cooperating villages) or indirect U.S. financing (through the United

                        <p>—U.S. development assistance must be justified either as advancing the
                            economy of the host country or as advancing U.S. foreign policy
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>—There is general agreement that fundamental economic policy is the
                            principal determinant of the rate at which a particular economy will
                            grow; and that economic growth, rather than negative restraints, is the
                            major cause of declines in fertility. Representative of this consensus
                            are World Bank studies concluding that sixty percent of fertility
                            reduction is attributable to economic expansion (and the greater
                            sophistication, higher standard of living, and aspirations for one’s
                            children that accompany growth), while only fifteen percent can be
                            traced to population control programs.<note n="3" xml:id="d268fn3">Not

                        <p>These areas of consensus do not, of course, define the limits of debate.
                            They nevertheless form a useful basis for public policy, especially as
                            it pertains to foreign assistance. In the declaration of the Ottawa
                            Economic Summit last July, President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                                >Reagan</persName> and the leaders of the other six major
                            industrialized nations stated:<note n="4" xml:id="d268fn4">See <ref
                                    target="#d267">Document 267</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>“We are deeply concerned about the implications of world population
                            growth. Many developing countries are taking action to deal with that
                            problem, in ways sensitive to human values and dignity; and to develop
                            human resources including technical and managerial capabilities. We
                            recognize the importance of these issues, and will place greater
                            emphasis on international efforts in these areas.”</p>
                        <pb facs="0794" n="748" xml:id="pg_748"/>
                        <p>The concerns expressed at Ottawa have centered on the perceived impact of
                            population growth on human welfare. In the words of the U.S. Coordinator
                            of Population Affairs, <persName corresp="#p_BRE_1">Richard E.
                                Benedick</persName>, “The fundamental objective of U.S. population
                            policy is betterment of the human condition and economic and social
                            progress, which will promote international peace and stability.”</p>
                        <p>No consensus exists as to the totality of the means that should be
                            applied globally in order to achieve these objectives. It is easier to
                            define, however, how the United States can best deploy its own resources
                            in helping developing nations achieve a “betterment of the human
                            condition”, and thus implement the purposes of the Ottawa statement.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, I have concluded that the United States should adopt the
                            following approach to international population issues:</p>
                        <p>—U.S. development assistance should concentrate on helping recipient
                            countries to cross the threshold to sustainable economic growth. Our
                            expenditures can have the largest impact, dollar for dollar, if they are
                            focused on what we should do best. And that is encouraging
                            market-oriented policies and helping to build the infrastructure of
                            skills and technology that can foster individual initiative and
                            enterprise.</p>
                        <p>—The economic growth which is made possible by sound market policies is
                            without question the most powerful factor in controlling population
                            growth. In the long run, it is certainly the most effective means, short
                            of an abhorrent coercion, to effect fertility decline.</p>
                        <p>—Because the population control movement is closely associated with
                            no-growth attitudes at variance with the economic policies of the
                            Administration, and, more important, because the fundamental assumptions
                            of that effort are being challenged by a growing body of critical
                            scholarship, the U.S. government should not appear to endorse
                            assumptions about population growth which, like many other policy
                            assumptions of the 1960’s and 1970’s, may prove to have been
                            erroneous.</p>
                        <p>—U.S. involvement in family planning services within a particular country
                            should be within the context of our broader programs to improve the
                            health of its people. One purpose should be maternal and child health.
                            Any population control objective in those same activities should be left
                            to the host government. It may choose to stress fertility reduction, but
                            U.S. participation should emphasize the goal of healthy families.</p>
                        <p>—A host government can be given the option of allocating, for family
                            planning services in support of its population control programs, up to
                            ten percent of the U.S. development assistance funds earmarked for that
                            country, which is a ratio consistent with current allocation of <pb
                                facs="0795" n="749" xml:id="pg_749"/> U.S. assistance. This will
                            ensure that U.S. funding of such activities is based on the host
                            country’s voluntary assessment of its own priorities. It will also avoid
                            the wasteful use of funds for population programs in those countries
                            whose governments are not truly committed to them.</p>
                        <p>—U.S. Government expenditures, whether directly or through contractors
                            and grantees, designed to convince public officials of developing
                            countries to undertake population control efforts, should be
                            terminated.</p>
                        <p>—As the U.S. Government more precisely focuses its development assistance
                            funds and encourages their use according to sound principles of economic
                            growth, the office of Coordinator of Population Affairs becomes an
                            anachronism. At a time when respected authorities in the field of
                            demographics disagree as to the relationship between fertility and
                            development, that office represents an outdated Departmental public
                            relations commitment to one set of controversial views in an uncertain
                            debate. The State Department should abolish that office, and assign
                            responsibility for the U.S. role in international population programs
                            and agencies to the Bureau for International Organizations.</p>
                        <p>—To ensure that no U.S. funds are expended for abortions, contributions
                            to private voluntary organizations or United Nations organizations in
                            the field of family planning should be limited to those which do not
                            finance or encourage abortion. Otherwise, the restriction legislatively
                            imposed by the <persName corresp="#p_HJA_1">Helms</persName> Amendment
                            will be evaded as U.S. funds simply supplant other moneys that are then
                            used for abortion.</p>
                        <p>—As a matter of policy, no U.S. funds should be expended to support any
                            population control program, or family planning campaign, that would be
                            unacceptable or offensive in the United States. This especially applies
                            to coercive measures.</p>
                        <p>—Finally, since the State Department’s and <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss>’s principal activities in the field of population
                            control have been undertaken pursuant to directives issued from time to
                            time by the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss>, any fundamental
                            redirection of U.S. international population control policy, such as
                            recommended above, should issue from that body.</p>

                                        corresp="#p_BJL_2">Buckley</persName> on Population
                                    Policy</hi></p>
                            <p>• I have looked at your April 14 memo to me, forwarding a copy of
                                your memo to Al on US population policy and foreign assistance.</p>
                            <p>• I appreciate your careful review of these issues and found much
                                merit in your memo in terms of possible areas for redirecting policy
                                and programs.</p>
                            <p>• Before taking <hi rend="italic">any</hi> steps to institute a new
                                policy approach or programs, however, we should have a prompt
                                interagency review of the subject.</p>
                            <p>• Your memo need not surface anywhere in the process but we could
                                ensure that the review addresses the issues and types of measures
                                addressed in your approach.</p>
                            <p>• The interagency review might have some additional ideas or some
                                different ones. At any rate, we should see what it produces before
                                jumping. Even if it produces something largely the same, we will not
                                be open for criticism of changing policy without process.</p>
                            <p>• Therefore, I do not believe you should send your memo to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName> or <persName

                                    corresp="#p_MJL_1">Malone</persName> to institute anything new
                                at this stage (as you noted it would hit the street soon
                                thereafter). I would like you to name someone on your staff to work
                                with <persName corresp="#p_GMA_1">Mike Guhin</persName> on my staff
                                on a memo directing an interagency review.</p>

                            related to United States policy, foreign assistance and governmental
                            organization as they relate to international population issues.</p>
                        <p>• What major factors affect population growth and to what extent?</p>
                        <p>• What expenditures/programs does the U.S. have for analyzing the
                            implications of population growth?</p>
                        <p>• What assumptions underlie U.S. policy and assistance and what are the
                            bases for these assumptions?</p>
                        <p>• What are the objectives of U.S. international population policy and
                            programs and their relationship to U.S. security, foreign policy and
                            other interests?</p>
                        <p>• What are the present and prospective assistance programs with other
                            countries and contributions to private and United Nations organizations
                            in the population area?</p>
                        <p>• What have U.S. population assistance programs achieved?</p>
                        <p>• Are these programs and the activities of the organizations consistent
                            with the U.S. Government’s domestic programs, practices or approach in
                            population matters, and would they in effect be acceptable or practiced
                            in the United States? How is such consistency monitored and what actions
                            are taken in the event of inconsistency?</p>
                        <p>• More specifically, are U.S. funds contributed to countries or to
                            private or international organizations that finance or encourage
                            coercive measures or abortion? If so, what is the rationale for such
                            programs or contributions?</p>
                        <p>• Assuming economic growth is a major factor in affecting population
                            growth, what kinds of trade-offs or considerations should be weighed in
                            allocating financial assistance between such programs with other
                            countries?</p>

                        <p>• What are the interests, policies and activities or programs in the
                            population area of those governments which the United States cooperates
                            with or assists?</p>
                        <p>• Are U.S. cooperative or assistance programs entirely voluntary on the
                            part of the foreign government? Does the U.S. in any way condition or
                            link other forms of assistance to acceptance of assistance or programs
                            in the population area? What expenditures does the U.S. have for
                            promoting population programs in other countries and should we have
                            expenditures for promotion?</p>
                        <p>• What policy and program changes have been made since January 1981, and
                            what principles guide U.S. population assistance programs and
                            contributions? How have the policy, programs and principles been
                            articulated by Administration officials to date?</p>

                            “there is a general view” that United Nations population programs (i.e.,
                                <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss>) “are the most successful
                            programs in the less developed world.” In a New York statement,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KJJ_1">Kirkpatrick</persName> said, “I
                            personally am very enthusiastic about the work of <gloss

                            added, “Anyone who has studied development particularly understands that

                            unless we help them cope with the population growth problem . . . To do
                            less would be like pouring water into a bucket with a hole in it.”</p>

                        <p>2. Following high level consultations at the Vatican on US–Vatican
                            cooperation in population matters, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRE_1">Benedick</persName>, Coordinator of Population
                            Affairs, was received by Pope John Paul II in a special audience on Feb.
                            16. Noting the implications of unprecedented population growth in the
                            Third World for maternal and child health, quality of life, and the
                            stability of nations, <persName corresp="#p_BRE_1">Benedick</persName>
                            cited the spiritual and material degradation he had personally witnessed
                            in many countries. He emphasized that US international population
                            assistance is based on voluntarism and is consistent with family
                            stability and local cultural and religious values. The Pope agreed on
                            the gravity of the demographic problem. Expressing familiarity with the
                            substance of <persName corresp="#p_BRE_1">Benedick</persName>’s earlier
                            conversations, the Pope stated that he was “profoundly moved by your
                            concerns.” He agreed that governments have a responsibility for the
                            conditions of life of future generations. The Pope stressed the
                            importance of human dignity, natural law, and discipline in implementing
                            governmental policies, and referred to the encyclical humanae vitae and
                            to his own 1981 exhortation on the family. It was agreed to continue the
                            “cordial collaboration” represented by these consultations. <pb

                        <p>3. In other meetings Feb. 15–17, <persName corresp="#p_BRE_1"
                                >Benedick</persName>, accompanied by me and/or my deputy, called on
                            Cardinal Baggio, Prefect of the Sacred Congregation of Bishops; Cardinal
                            Knox, President of the Pontifical Council for the Family; Archbishop
                            Silvestrini, Secretary of the Council for Public Affairs; Bishop
                            Rossano, Rector Magnificus of the Pontifical Lateran University; and
                            several other Vatican officials. Purpose of discussions was to underline
                            US view of the seriousness of the demographic situation for many
                            countries, to explain US development and population policies, and
                            generally to establish an atmosphere of mutual confidence and
                            cooperation in preparing for the 1984 International Conference on
                            Population in Mexico City.</p>
                        <p>4. The main elements of current Vatican position on population matters
                            are:</p>
                        <p>(A) Recognition of grave consequences of rapid population growth in Third
                            World;</p>
                        <p>(B) Promotion of “responsible parenthood;”</p>
                        <p>(C) Reliance on periodic abstinence—natural family planning (<gloss
                                target="#t_NFP_1">NFP</gloss>) methods—as the only response
                            currently acceptable under “natural law;”</p>
                        <p>(D) Encouragement of US–Vatican dialogue on population issues.
                            Specifically, Bishop Cox (Sec. of Council for Family) suggested
                                <persName corresp="#p_BRE_1">Benedick</persName> organize small,
                            confidential bilateral meeting of experts in Washington to explore
                            further technical areas of US–Vatican cooperation, while Msgr. Caffarra
                            (President of newly established John Paul II Institute for Matrimony and
                            Family at Lateran University) invited <persName corresp="#p_BRE_1"
                                >Benedick</persName> to participate in Vatican Conference on
                            “responsible parenthood” in September.</p>
                        <p>5. The Vatican is not monolithic on this issue, however, and there are
                            subtle nuances between what might be termed “abstract” and
                            “realistic/pastoral” approaches. Representative of the former is
                            Cardinal Knox, who asserts that no compromise is ever possible over the
                            issue of contraception, considers the <gloss target="#t_NFP_1"
                                >NFP</gloss> methods of his Australian countryman Billings to be the
                            final word,<note n="3" xml:id="d272fn3">Dr. John Billings, developer of
                                the Billings Ovulation Method.</note> and couples this with
                            criticism of US armaments outlays. Symptomatic of the strains is a
                            current conflict between Caffarra and the Academic Senate of the
                            Pontifical Lateran University, with the latter favoring free academic
                            inquiry, while the former maintains that on this fundamental point of
                            morality, his new <pb facs="0804" n="758" xml:id="pg_758"/> institute
                            cannot admit differing theological or biological views. There is
                            substantial (but not universal) agreement in the Vatican that humanae
                            vitae was not intended as an infallible pronouncement, and that it
                            explicitly opens a door for further scientific and philosophical
                            research and possible evolution in light of changing world
                            conditions.</p>

                            follows personal invitation from Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal

                            <persName corresp="#p_BRE_1">Benedick</persName> has clearly impressed
                            highest levels of the Vatican with the sincere concern of <gloss
                                target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> for human dignity and family values,
                            while supporting voluntary family planning programs in countries
                            requesting such aid. He has maintained the basic US view of the urgency
                            of the demographic situation as it affects economic and social
                            development in many countries, but has also demonstrated US sensitivity
                            to Vatican concerns, especially in the past two years, through greater
                            emphasis on human values and increased US support for natural family
                            planning.</p>
                        <p>7. As a result of this extremely successful visit, there is clearly
                            greater awareness by the Holy See that the US, in its development and
                            population policies, shares important common values and objectives with
                            the Roman Catholic Church. In light of past accusations against US
                            policy, this demonstrates important progress.</p>
                        <p>8. I believe this important initiative has been handled with considerable
                            sensitivity and tact. These discussions are especially significant in
                            the context of preparations for the Mexico City conference, in contrast
                            to the atmosphere of misunderstanding and acrimony that characterized

                            <p>1. “What assumptions underlie U.S. policy and assistance, and what
                                are the bases for these assumptions?”</p>
                            <p>Answer: One must begin with the demographic realities. Even with
                                birth rates on the decline, the world’s population will probably
                                rise by nearly two billion people in the last two decades of the
                                20th century—the equivalent of adding 40 new countries of the
                                current size of Egypt. Ninety percent of this growth will occur in
                                the world’s low-income countries. In most of these countries, the
                                annual increments to population size are growing larger. Areas of
                                strategic and economic importance, including Central America and the
                                Caribbean, Egypt, Turkey, Nigeria, Kenya, Indonesia, the
                                Philippines, Pakistan and India, face a potential doubling of
                                population in the next 20–30 years. Unless birth <pb facs="0806"
                                    n="760" xml:id="pg_760"/> rates can decline more rapidly, many
                                already crowded countries will triple their populations within the
                                next three generations.</p>
                            <p>Underlying U.S. policy is the recognition that these unprecedented
                                demographic changes have important political, economic, security,
                                and human implications. Assistance to friendly countries in
                                addressing population growth problems has been an important element
                                of U.S. foreign policy for two decades. The Foreign Assistance Act
                                (section 104) states: “The Congress recognizes that poor health
                                conditions and uncontrolled population growth can vitiate otherwise
                                successful development efforts,” and that “. . . voluntary
                                population planning programs can make a substantial contribution to
                                economic development, higher living standards, and improved health
                                and nutrition.”</p>
                            <p>At Economic Summit meetings, the President joined the leaders of
                                other major industrialized nations in declaring that, “We are deeply
                                concerned about the implications of world population growth . . . We
                                recognize the importance of these issues and will place greater
                                emphasis on international efforts in these areas” (Ottawa,
                                    1981);<note n="5" xml:id="d273fn5">See <ref target="#d266fn6"

                                special encouragement to . . . programmes to address the

                                strategy, and this Administration has reaffirmed a 20-year U.S.
                                commitment to voluntary family planning efforts.”</p>
                            <p>Behind these policy statements is a substantial body of analysis on
                                the effects of modern population growth in the Third World and on
                                the utility of voluntary family planning programs in reducing
                                fertility and improving the health of mothers and children. These
                                conclusions are based on empirical evidence gathered in numerous
                                developing <pb facs="0807" n="761" xml:id="pg_761"/> countries, on

                            <p>Answer: <hi rend="italic">Objectives of U.S. Population Policy and
                                    Programs</hi></p>
                            <p>As with other forms of development aid, the general objective of U.S.
                                population assistance is to promote economic development and
                                political stability by improving the human condition in friendly
                                countries which ask for our assistance. Population programs are
                                designed as a necessary complement to other humanitarian development
                                efforts aimed at reduction of poverty and improvement in the quality
                                of life.</p>
                            <p>The U.S. and other donor countries cannot indefinitely provide the
                                growing resources needed to feed, train, and create jobs for
                                continually rising numbers of poor in the Third World. Thus, failure
                                to help in reducing the pressure of population growth risks
                                undercutting U.S. development and security assistance. Relatively
                                small outlays for population programs at this time may save us much
                                larger sums for emergency food assistance and/or military
                                peacekeeping assistance in the future.</p>
                            <p>The specific objective of U.S. international population assistance is
                                to aid countries requesting such help in the development and
                                implementation of humane population policies and voluntary family
                                planning programs. U.S. aid is directed at strengthening local
                                institutions, including the private sector; training health,
                                demographic, and other personnel; providing medically approved
                                methods of family planning; assisting in demographic data collection
                                and policy analysis; and supporting population-related biomedical
                                and social science research.</p>

                                20–39) will increase in the North by 20 million between 1980 and
                                2000—in the South, by 600 million. (This is not a “projection,” as
                                these individuals are already born.) Within developing countries,
                                there is a widening income gap between the rich, elite classes (who
                                generally practice family planning) and the poor (who generally do
                                not).</p>
                            <p>Population factors—including rapid urbanization and differential
                                growth rates among a country’s ethnic or social groups—complicate
                                solutions to a range of other problems and can limit a government’s

                                changing social and economic demands. These demographic changes
                                affect the prospects for economic development, diverting resources
                                from investment to consumption, and exacerbating problems of
                                malnutrition, overcrowded cities, unemployment among socially
                                volatile young adults, deforestation and environmental degradation.
                                Recent <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss> studies of several key
                                countries indicate related potential dangers of political
                                instability, extremism, urban crime, mass migration, and possible
                                conflicts over scarce resources.</p>
                            <p>Our interests in many of these countries include—in addition to our
                                traditional concern for human welfare and dignity—such geopolitical
                                factors as strategic location, military bases, supply of oil or
                                other critical raw materials, and markets for U.S. exports and
                                safety of U.S. investments.</p>
                            <p>In the Middle East, for example, the four most populous
                                nations—Turkey, Egypt, Iran, and Pakistan—are experiencing in
                                varying degrees the complex effects of rapid population growth. In
                                each of these countries, dependence on food imports and
                                unemployment/underemployment are already serious concerns, and the
                                labor pool is growing at an alarming pace. Political instability in
                                this region would imperil vital U.S. interests, weakening the
                                southern flank of <gloss target="#t_NATO_1">NATO</gloss> and our
                                Indian Ocean capability.</p>
                            <p>Other countries affected by demographic pressures include such key
                                suppliers of U.S. petroleum imports as Indonesia, Mexico, and
                                Nigeria—already heavily populated nations with high rates of
                                population growth. They also include countries like Bolivia, Brazil,
                                Morocco, the Philippines, Zimbabwe, and Thailand, which supply
                                essential U.S. imports of minerals for defense production. Problems
                                of unemployment/underemployment and wage differentials, aggravated
                                by high population growth, also contribute to pressures for
                                migration to the United States from Mexico, Central America, and the
                                Caribbean.</p>

                                Assuming economic growth is a major factor in affecting population
                                growth, what kinds of trade-offs or considerations should be weighed
                                in allocating financial assistance between such programs with other
                                countries?”</p>
                            <p>Answer: Rapid population growth in the Third World is a post-World
                                War II development directly attributable to substantial declines in
                                death rates, resulting from widespread improvements in nutrition and
                                health, while birth rates remained at traditionally high levels.</p>
                            <p>High fertility in less developed countries reflects such factors as
                                economic benefits from larger families, cultural and religious
                                mores, low status of women, and unavailability and/or ignorance of
                                effective means of contraception. Traditionally, many societies have
                                prevented <pb facs="0809" n="763" xml:id="pg_763"/> unwanted
                                children through such practices as infanticide, abortion, and
                                abandonment.</p>
                            <p>Economic growth is an important factor in reducing birth rates. In
                                the now-industrialized countries, however, the “demographic
                                transition” to lower fertility occurred over many decades, and under
                                conditions of smaller population growth rates, higher income, and
                                greater possibilities for emigration than is the case for the Third
                                World. Moreover, the numbers involved today are much greater, and
                                the youthful age structure—40 to 45 percent of a population under
                                15—means that there will be a dramatic increase in potential parents
                                in the coming decades. For example, the number of women of
                                child-bearing age in Mexico will grow from less than 6 million in
                                1960 to nearly 25 million by 2000. Even if these future parents have
                                fewer children, there is a built-in momentum which prevents a rapid
                                decline in population growth. Thus, for many developing countries,
                                continued growth in numbers is itself proving a major obstacle to
                                the kind of economic development which might theoretically lead to
                                smaller family size.</p>
                            <p>Some aspects of the development process—e.g., urbanization, improved
                                income distribution, education and employment of women—contribute to
                                a desire for smaller family size. In order, however, for changed
                                attitudes to be reflected in lower birth rates within a reasonable
                                time-frame, it is essential that couples have access to modern
                                methods of family planning.</p>
                            <p>Numerous research studies indicate that countries with improving
                                socioeconomic conditions <hi rend="italic">combined with</hi> family
                                planning programs experience the greatest decreases in population
                                growth rates. While population aid alone will not solve the problems
                                of economic development, most observers agree that lasting progress
                                can only be made when family planning and population programs are an
                                integral element of national development efforts. The sheer
                                logistics involved in reaching tens of thousands of rural villages
                                with family planning information, services, and follow-up, and in
                                training adequate numbers of medical and paramedical personnel,
                                imply that most developing countries require some external
                                support.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, as has been clearly expressed at many international
                                meetings in an almost unprecedented consensus of North and South, an
                                effective development strategy should include not only general
                                development aid but also population assistance. The “trade-off”
                                cannot be determined mechanistically: as with other development
                                sectors, country allocations will be determined by the need for
                                specific programs, governmental commitment, absorptive capacity, and
                                popular interest and participation.</p>

                                official policies supporting population and family planning
                                activities has increased from 36 to 67. Over 90 percent of the
                                developing world’s people live in countries with some kind of
                                population policy: 79 percent live in 35 countries where the
                                official policy is to reduce population growth, while an additional
                                14 percent live in countries where support for family planning is
                                based solely on a human rights and health rationale. Developing
                                countries are also devoting more of their own resources to this
                                sector. A decade ago more than half of <gloss target="#t_LDC_1"

                            <pb facs="0811" n="765" xml:id="pg_765"/>
                            <p>Answer: U.S. population assistance flows through multilateral,
                                bilateral, and private channels to over 110 countries. U.S. programs
                                have played a major role in about 30 countries and a complementary
                                role in the remaining 80 countries, through projects of the United
                                Nations and private organizations. This assistance has helped to
                                improve the health and well-being of millions of individuals and
                                families, while contributing to improved prospects for national

                                population assistance, as shown in the accompanying table. Declines

                                example, the population of married women of childbearing age
                                practicing family planning rose from nine percent in 1964 (before
                                U.S. assistance) to 55 percent by 1980; in Colombia, from 23 percent

                            <p>Answer: Current annual expenditures from all sources for population
                                and family planning programs in the developing world (exclusive of
                                China) are about one billion dollars annually. Approximately $400
                                million of this total comes from external donors, the remainder from
                                    <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s themselves.</p>

                                agreements, including $12.4 million for Africa, $15.0 million for

                            <p>Support of population programs from other donor countries has
                                increased considerably, from under one-third of total population aid
                                in the early 1970’s to about half at present. The U.S. share of
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss>’s budget has declined,
                                from 35 percent between 1967 and 1970, to 25 percent in FY 1983.

                                include Japan, Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, the U.K., and the

                                add their own voluntary contributions to the work of this
                                organization. World Bank loans in this area amount to less than one
                                percent of total annual lending, but President A. W. Clausen has
                                expressed an intention to expand the Bank’s role in addressing

                                    >LDC</gloss>’s have greatly increased requests for population
                                aid. There is now a backlog of over $100 million in requests to
                                    <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> which cannot be funded from
                                current budgets. Substantial additional assistance will be essential
                                because of an anticipated doubling in the number of child-bearing
                                women between 1975 and the year 2000, coupled with a decline in
                                buying power of donor support. For example, <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                    >AID</gloss>’s FY 1983 program of $211 million, although $88
                                million more than the FY 1972 level, is actually $31 million lower
                                in constant dollars, or a one-quarter reduction in buying power.</p>
                            <p>7. “Are these programs and the activities of the organizations
                                consistent with the U.S. Government’s domestic programs, practices,
                                or approach in population matters, and would they, in effect, be
                                acceptable or practiced in the United States? How is such
                                consistency monitored and what actions are taken in the event of
                                inconsistency?”</p>
                            <p>Answer: U.S. international population assistance operates under the
                                same principles as domestic family planning programs. These include
                                voluntary participation, provision of high-quality services, and
                                offering of a wide variety of family planning methods, including
                                natural family planning, in order to maximize individual choice.

                                policy determinations of these documents have proven a workable
                                basis for U.S. policy. The growing population problems in many key
                                countries, combined with the strengths and experience of U.S.
                                programs, have led this Administration to maintain U.S. leadership
                                in this field. We believe that it would be appropriate and useful to
                                have updated and revised policy guidance, based upon existing
                                statements on this subject by the President, Secretary <persName

                            <p>Concerning the organizational framework for international population
                                matters, the currently shared primary responsibility of the
                                Department of State and the Agency for International Development,
                                with the collaboration as appropriate of such other agencies as
                                    <gloss target="#t_NIH_1">NIH</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CIA_1"
                                    >CIA</gloss>, and Census Bureau, has proven effective over many
                                years. Solution of population problems is an essential part of the
                                development process; therefore, responsibility for program
                                implementation should continue to reside primarily in the Agency for
                                International Development. There are, however, foreign policy and
                                national security implications connected with implementation of
                                population strategy, as well as various diplomatic activities which
                                can enhance the effectiveness of U.S. and international efforts. For
                                these reasons, the Department of State’s role in population policy
                                development and coordination, diplomatic activities, and
                                representation remains appropriate.</p>

                            Congressionally earmarked portion of <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss>’s population account. Congress routinely earmarks more
                            than we propose. This year the earmark is $38,000,000. <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>’s contributions are commingled with
                            all other contributions into a common fund and support <gloss
                                target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss>’s programs in a large number of
                            countries. Although we “attribute” our commingled funds to projects not
                            involving abortion, critics continue to argue that U.S. financial
                            support does result in a share of U.S. funds supporting each of <gloss
                                target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss>’s projects.</p>
                        <p>Since <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, as a general matter, is
                            prohibited by law from funding abortion and involuntary sterilization,
                            we believe that we should avoid such funding, when practical, even when
                            done through multilateral organizations.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, we are trying to devise a mechanism whereby we can avoid
                            sitting in judgment over each national program conducted by <gloss
                                target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss>, and yet assure that <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> funds do not flow to prohibited
                            uses.</p>
                        <p>One mechanism would be to establish a separate bank account which would
                            fund activities the U.S. clearly supports. Other mechanisms might be
                            possible and we are anxious to look at all options. In the meantime, we
                            have not sent the latest check to <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1"
                                >UNFPA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>We will keep you advised.</p>

                            <p rend="sectiontitleital">DRAFT Statement</p>
                            <p>For many years, the United States has supported, and helped to
                                finance, programs of family planning, particularly in the less
                                developed countries. This Administration has continued that support
                                but has placed it within a policy context different from that of the
                                past. It is sufficiently evident that the current exponential growth
                                in global population cannot continue indefinitely. There is no
                                question of the ultimate need to achieve a condition of population
                                equilibrium. The <pb facs="0825" n="779" xml:id="pg_779"/>
                                differences that do exist concern the choice of strategies and
                                methods for the achievement of that goal. The experience of the last
                                two decades not only makes possible but requires a sharper focus for
                                our population policy. It requires a more refined approach to
                                problems which appear today in quite a different light than they did
                                twenty years ago.</p>
                            <p>First and most important, in any particular society today, population
                                growth is, of itself, a neutral phenomenon. It is not necessarily
                                good or ill. It becomes an asset or a problem only in conjunction
                                with other factors, such as economic policy, social constraints,
                                need for manpower, and so forth. The relationship between population
                                growth and economic development is not a negative one. More people
                                do not mean less growth; that is absurd on its face. Indeed, both in
                                the American experience and in the economic history of most advanced
                                nations, population growth has been an essential element in economic
                                progress.</p>
                            <p>Before the advent of governmental population programs, several
                                factors had combined to create an unprecedented surge in population
                                over most of the world. Although population levels in many
                                industrialized nations had reached or were approaching equilibrium
                                in the period before the Second World War, the baby boom that
                                followed in its wake resulted in a dramatic, but temporary,
                                population “tilt” toward youth. The disproportionate number of
                                infants, children, teenagers, and eventually young adults did strain
                                the social infrastructure of schools, health facilities, law
                                enforcement and so forth. It also sustained strong economic growth
                                and was probably critical in boosting the American standard of
                                living to new heights, despite occasionally counterproductive
                                government policies.</p>
                            <p>Among the less developed nations, a coincidental population increase
                                was caused by entirely different factors, directly related to the
                                humanitarian efforts of the United States and other western
                                countries. A tremendous expansion of health services—from simple
                                inoculations to sophisticated surgery—saved millions of lives every
                                year. Emergency relief, facilitated by modern transport, helped
                                millions to survive flood, famine, and drought. The sharing of
                                technology, the teaching of agriculture and engineering, the spread
                                of western ideals in the treatment of women and children all helped
                                to drastically reduce the mortality rates, especially infant
                                mortality, and to lengthen the life span.</p>
                            <p>The result, to no one’s surprise, was more people, everywhere. This
                                was not a failure but a success. It demonstrated not poor planning
                                or bad policy but human progress in a new era of international
                                assistance, technological advance, and human compassion. The
                                population boom was a challenge; it need not have been a crisis.
                                Seen in its broader context, it required a measured, modulated
                                response. It provoked an overreaction by some, largely because it
                                coincided with two negative factors which, together, hindered
                                families and nations in adapting to their changing
                                circumstances.</p>
                            <pb facs="0826" n="780" xml:id="pg_780"/>
                            <p>The first of these factors was governmental control of economies, a
                                pathology which spread throughout the developing world with
                                sufficient virulence to keep much of it from developing further. As
                                economic decision-making was concentrated in the hands of planners
                                and public officials, the ability of average men and women to work
                                towards a better future was impaired, and sometimes crippled.
                                Agriculture was devastated by government price fixing that wiped out
                                rewards for labor. Job creation in infant industries was hampered by
                                confiscatory taxes. Personal industry and thrift were penalized,
                                while dependency upon the state was encouraged. Political
                                considerations made it difficult for the economy to adjust to
                                changes in supply and demand or to disruptions in world trade and
                                finance. Under such circumstances, population growth changed from an
                                asset in the development of economic potential to a peril.</p>
                            <p>The worst consequence of economic statism was that it disrupted the
                                natural mechanism for slowing population growth in problem areas.
                                The world’s more affluent nations have reached a population
                                equilibrium without compulsion and, in most cases, even before it
                                was government policy to achieve it. The controlling factor in these
                                cases has been the adjustment, by individual families, of
                                reproductive behavior to economic opportunity and aspiration.
                                Economic freedom has led to economically rational behavior. As
                                opportunities and the standard of living rise, the birth rate
                                falls.</p>
                            <p>That historic pattern would already be well under way in many nations
                                where population growth is today a problem, if short-sighted
                                policies had not disrupted economic incentives, rewards, and
                                advancement. In this regard, localized crises of population growth
                                are evidence of too much government control and planning, rather
                                than too little.</p>
                            <p>The second factor that turned the population boom into a crisis was
                                confined to the western world. It was an outbreak of an
                                anti-intellectualism, which attacked science, technology, and the
                                very concept of material progress. Joined to a commendable and long
                                overdue concern for the environment, it was more a reflection of
                                anxiety about the unsettled times and the uncertain future and
                                disregard of human experience and scientific sophistication. It was
                                not unlike other waves of cultural anxiety that have, over the
                                centuries, swept through western civilization during times of social
                                stress and scientific exploration.</p>
                            <p>The combination of these two factors—counterproductive economic
                                policies in poor and struggling nations and a pseudo-scientific
                                pessimism among the more advanced—provoked the demographic
                                overreaction of the 1960’s and 1970’s. Doomsday scenarios took the
                                place of realistic forecasts, and too many governments pursued
                                population control measures that have had little impact on
                                population growth, rather than sound economic policies that create

                                was the easy way out, and it did not work. It focused on a symptom
                                and neglected the underlying ailments. For the last three years,
                                this Administration has sought to reverse that approach. We
                                recognize that, in some cases, immediate population pressures may
                                make advisable short-term efforts to meliorate them. But this cannot
                                be a substitute for the economic reforms that put a society on the
                                road toward growth and, as an aftereffect, toward slower population
                                increase as well.</p>
                            <p>Nor can population control substitute for the rapid and responsible
                                development of natural resources. In responding to certain Members
                                of Congress concerning the previous Administration’s Global 2000
                                    report,<note n="3" xml:id="d278fn3">Reference is to the Global
                                    2000 Report to the President released in 1980 by the Council on
                                    Environmental Quality and the Department of State.</note> this
                                Administration in 1981 repudiated its call “for more governmental
                                supervision and control. Historically, that has tended to restrict
                                the availability of resources and to hamper the development of
                                technology, rather than to assist it. Recognizing the seriousness of
                                environmental and economic problems, and their relationship to
                                social and political pressures, especially in the developing
                                nations, the Administration places a priority upon technological
                                advance and economic expansion, which hold out the hope of
                                prosperity and stability of a rapidly changing world. That hope can
                                be realized, of course, only to the extent that government’s
                                response to problems, whether economic or ecological, respects and
                                enhances individual freedom, which makes true progress possible and
                                worthwhile.”</p>
                            <p>Those principles underlie this country’s approach to the United
                                Nations Conference on Population to be held in Mexico City in
                                August. In accord with those principles, we reject compulsion or
                                coercion in family planning programs, whether it is exercised
                                against families within a society or against nations within the
                                family of man. The United Nations Declaration of the Rights of the
                                Child (1959) calls for legal protection for children before birth as
                                well as after birth; and the United States accordingly does not
                                consider abortion an acceptable element of family planning programs
                                and will not contribute to those of which it is a part. Nor will it
                                any longer contribute directly or indirectly to family planning
                                programs funded by governments or private organizations that
                                advocate abortion as an instrument of population control. Efforts to
                                lower population growth in cases in which it is deemed advisable to
                                do so must, moreover, respect the religious beliefs and culture of
                                each society. Population control is not a panacea. It will not solve
                                problems of massive unemployment. Jobs are not lost because there
                                are too many people in a given area. Jobs are created by the
                                conjunction of human wants and investment capital. Population growth
                                    <pb facs="0828" n="782" xml:id="pg_782"/> fuels the former;
                                sound economic policies and properly directed international
                                assistance can provide the latter. Indeed, population density may
                                make the latter more feasible by concentrating the need for both
                                human services and technology. But as long as oppressive economic
                                policies penalize those who work, save, and invest, joblessness will
                                persist.</p>
                            <p>Population control cannot solve problems of unauthorized migration
                                across national boundries. People do not leave their homes, and
                                often their families, to seek more space. They do so in search of
                                opportunity and freedom. Reducing their numbers gives them neither.
                                Population control cannot avert natural disasters, including famines
                                provoked by cyclical drought. Fortunately, world food supplies have
                                been adequate to relieve those circumstances in recent years.
                                Problems of transportation remain; but there are far deeper problems
                                as well, in those governmental policies which restrict the rewards
                                of agricultural pursuits, encourage the abandonment of farmland, and
                                concentrate people in urban areas.</p>
                            <p>It is time to concentrate upon those root problems which frequently
                                exacerbate population pressures. By focusing upon real remedies for
                                underdeveloped economies, the United Nations Conference on
                                Population can reduce demographic issues to their proper place. It
                                is an important place, but not the controlling one. It requires our
                                continuing attention within the broader context of economic growth
                                and of the economic freedom that is its prerequisite. Most of all,
                                questions of population growth require the approach outlined by
                                President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> in 1981, in
                                remarks before the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia: “Trust the
                                people, trust their intelligence and trust their faith, because
                                putting people first is the secret of economic success everywhere in
                                the world.”<note n="4" xml:id="d278fn4">See <hi rend="italic">Public

                        <p>I am grateful to Mexico, under the leadership of President Miguel de la
                            Madrid Hurtado, for its gracious hospitality in hosting the
                            International Conference on Population.</p>
                        <p>World leaders have come to recognize that the historically unprecedented
                            growth of population now occurring in many countries affects economic
                            and social development and presents a unique set of challenges and
                            opportunities. It is for these reasons that the United States provides
                            bilaterial and multilateral assistance in population programs.</p>
                        <p>Recognizing the seriousness of environmental and economic problems and
                            their relationship to social realities, the United States places a
                            priority upon technological advancement and economic expansion which
                            hold out the hope of prosperity and stability for a rapidly changing
                            world. That hope can be realized to the extent nations respond to
                            problems, whether economic or ecological, in ways that respect and
                            enhance the freedom and dignity of the individual.</p>
                        <p>We believe population programs can and must be truly voluntary, cognizant
                            of the rights and responsibilities of individuals and families, and
                            respectful of religious and cultural values. When they are, such
                            programs can make an important contribution to economic and social
                            development, to the health of mothers and children, and to the stability
                            of the family and of society.</p>
                        <p>Our concern over the dimensions of demographic change is inseparable from
                            a concern for the welfare of children—who are the ultimate resource of
                            any society. Together we must strive for a world in which children are
                            happy and healthy. They must have the opportunity to develop to their
                            full mental and physical potential and, as young adults, be able to find
                            productive work and to enjoy a decent and dignified existence.</p>
                        <p>I wish the participants in this Conference good counsel and inspiration
                            in addressing these issues. I am confident they will fulfill their
                            responsibility to produce recommendations for action by the
                            international community which will improve the well-being of generations
                            to come.</p>

                            If we go to Mexico with such a position, we will seriously damage
                            ourselves in the eyes of our allies and our friends in the third world,
                            not to mention domestically with key Members of the House and Senate
                            whose support we need today for foreign assistance legislation.</p>
                        <p>We are having a real problem managing this issue since it is so
                            politically charged and the Office of Policy Development has in its own
                            mind closed the book on the issue. We have been told that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJL_2">Jim Buckley</persName> has reviewed this
                            statement, likes it, and on the basis of it, has agreed to head the
                            delegation to Mexico. We are also told that the Office of Policy
                            Development expects to put its paper before the President for approval
                            next week upon his return to Washington. The objective, as we understand
                            it, is to gain a seal of approval from the President on the paper as
                            well as on a delegation list sympathetic to this new policy. This
                            timeframe will not give us sufficient time to comment and make
                            appropriate adjustments.</p>

                        <p>The paper’s principal thrust is to criticize sharply the undue emphasis

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">BACKGROUND</p>
                        <p>The White House paper reflects the reaction of some development
                            theorists, most prominently Julian Simon, to what they consider the
                            oversimplications implied in past strategies that population programs by
                            themselves would cause rapid declines in birth rates. They also argue
                            against the doomsday scenarios which laced much of the rhetoric of
                            earlier years. <persName corresp="#p_SHV_1">Simon</persName> and others
                            contend that population growth does not necessarily inhibit economic
                            development, pointing out that many of today’s developed industrial
                            countries experienced their most rapid population growth at precisely
                            the time that their economies were most rapidly expanding. From this
                            finding, they deduce that it is not population growth but something
                            else—in the case of the White House draft, inappropriate economic
                            policies—that has inhibited the economic development of Third World
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The critics of <persName corresp="#p_SHV_1">Simon</persName>’s approach
                            contend that his analytical model, which uses population and resource
                            trends of the U.S. and other industrialized countries, is not relevant
                            to today’s LDCs. They argue that the unprecedented rates and absolute
                            levels of population growth in many LDCs divert resources from
                            investment to consumption, complicate other problems (such as
                            malnutrition, illiteracy and unemployment), and impede the kind of
                            economic development which over the long run could lead to fertility
                            decline.</p>
                        <pb facs="0834" n="788" xml:id="pg_788"/>
                        <p>The prevailing academic view is that while economic development may lead
                            to lower fertility, rapid population growth generally retards the
                            development process. There has emerged a broad consensus that,
                            everything else being equal, economic growth will proceed faster when
                            population growth is held in check; it is argued that the cases of
                            Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Colombia and Costa Rica, among
                            others, show that family planning programs and economic development are
                            mutually reinforcing. Neither is a substitute for the other.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName>
                            Administration has moderated the more strident calls for population
                            control, acknowledging that it is not a development panacea. Even more
                            importantly, we have also have placed greater emphasis on a free market
                            approach in delivery of family planning services and have taken strong
                            steps to dissociate ourselves from abortion practices.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>Technical arguments aside, we believe that such a marked change in our
                            policies would have adverse political consequences, immediately and in
                            the longer term. A shift in signals would attract criticism from our
                            allies and important Third World governments which, at our urging, have
                            placed a high priority on family planning. This criticism would be
                            especially severe at a time of mounting U.S. interest rates and <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss> debt. Finally, we run the risk of
                            unraveling twenty years of U.S. efforts to convince the LDCs that family
                            planning programs are in their own national interests.</p>
                        <p>For the longer term, we agree with <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>

                            which predict that, if unchecked, population growth will contribute to
                            volatile economic and political conditions inimical to U.S. national
                            security interests. Countries whose labor forces are increasing at a
                            pace which, in the medium term, cannot be absorbed: Mexico, Turkey,
                            Egypt, Pakistan, Central America and the Caribbean, may well face
                            serious obstacles to political stability, as well as add to our
                            immigration problems.</p>
                        <p>Of course, this cannot be prevented by declines in population growth
                            rates alone. The real danger to our interests is that population
                            pressures can only exacerbate the problems.</p>

                            <p>The draft position paper prepared by the Office of Policy Development
                                has important foreign policy and national security implications. The
                                State Department strongly believes that the U.S. position for this
                                Conference should be carefully reviewed by the relevant agencies,
                                including State, <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>, Defense, and
                                    <gloss target="#t_CIA_1">CIA</gloss>, before any proposal is
                                presented to the President.</p>
                            <p>The <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1">Reagan</persName> Administration has
                                made some important adjustments in our international population
                                policy by placing greater emphasis on a free market approach to the
                                delivery of family planning services. We have also taken strong
                                steps to dissociate ourselves from abortion practices. In addition
                                we have moderated the more strident calls for population
                                control.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, the White House draft paper’s contention that population
                                programs are not panaceas is well founded. However, economic
                                development and population programs are mutually reinforcing.
                                Neither is a substitute for the other.</p>
                            <p>Technical arguments aside, we believe that the change in U.S.
                                policies proposed in the draft paper would have adverse political
                                consequences, immediately and in the longer term. Indeed, the paper
                                appears substantially to alter this Administration’s foreign policy
                                in the population field, as expressed by the President in his May 30
                                message to the <pb facs="0836" n="790" xml:id="pg_790"/> Mexico City
                                Conference, that “population programs . . . can make an important
                                contribution to economic and social development, to the health of
                                mothers and children, and to the stability of the family and of

                                America and the Caribbean) will face serious obstacles to political
                                stability as well as add to our immigration problems.</p>
                            <p>Of course, this cannot be prevented by declines in population growth

                                >NSC</gloss>’s name is on it. The paper contains serious basic
                            flaws. First it states that population growth in and of itself is never
                            really a problem, rather lack of improving economic conditions and
                            opportunities are the concerns we must address. This logic is equivalent
                            to saying an American family living in a slum with ten kids is not
                            suffering because of the size of the family but rather because the
                            family doesn’t earn $80,000 a year and own two Buicks. Clearly the size
                            of family wouldn’t matter at all if they were well off economically, but
                            it is ridiculous to think that free market based development alone can
                            solve the problems of the Indias and Pakistans of the world.</p>
                        <p>Rapid population growth limits governmental options, retards economic
                            growth, heightens youth and minority dissatisfaction, and leads to
                            international disorder and the imposition of more repressive forms of
                            government in the Third World. The <persName corresp="#p_SJA_1"

                            that advocate abortion as an instrument of population control”. In fact
                            the <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> has never condoned or supported
                            the use of abortion for birth control. But to cut off our family
                            planning funding to countries that do use abortion at times would serve
                            the opposite purpose of removing birth control alternatives to abortion.
                            Abortion is cheap and quick and will be used by states in the absence of
                            available birth control alternatives.</p>

                            and all changes.</p>
                        <p>Since the <persName corresp="#p_SJA_1">Svahn</persName> draft has leaked,
                            we should state that it is in fact the “White House” first draft (this
                            will of course earn us credit with fundamentalist groups). At the same
                            time we should now secretly transfer the lead on this population
                            conference and the issue paper to State. This way State would prepare
                            the proper position papers and the FSO’s, who are seen by many
                            conservatives as outside White House control, would take the flak for
                            the creation of a more moderate population policy.</p>
                        <p>Under this scenario, the White House would still receive credit from some
                            fundamentalist groups for a fight well fought, while State would in fact
                            present the proper position at Mexico City.</p>
                        <p>The Mexico City conference is not until August 7th so we should not rush
                            our moves on this matter. <persName corresp="#p_SJA_1">Svahn</persName>
                            told me today (Friday, June 15) that he is expected by <persName

                                >Baker</persName> to prepare another population policy draft based
                            on the State and <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> papers. As I
                            stated, the leak of another White House policy statement would be
                            disastrous. I also am certain that the State and <gloss
                                target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> papers which are unclassified will
                            also leak. Thus, <persName corresp="#p_SJA_1">Svahn</persName>’s rewrite
                            should be slowed down.</p>
                        <p>The question of <persName corresp="#p_BJL_2">Buckley</persName> chairing
                            our delegation must also be decided. As stated, I believe we should make
                            it seem as if the careerists at State have seized control of this issue
                            after this matter has cooled down in the next few weeks.</p>
                        <p>Clearly, this strategy can only be adopted if <persName

                            State to develop a balanced, hard hitting population paper, but if the
                            White House is still viewed as having the lead on this issue, any new
                            paper we author will only be unfavorably compared with the <persName

                                    >ICP</gloss>) offers the U.S. an opportunity to strengthen the

                                development and population which has emerged since the last such

                                encourage developing countries to adopt sound economic policies and,
                                where appropriate, population policies consistent with respect for

                                time-frame—is contributing to unusual economic, social, and resource
                                pressures which threaten to undermine U.S. initiatives for peace,

                                that can be exploited by communism and extremist movements which

                                will increase by 20 million in the North between 1980 and 2000—in

                            <p>Sound economic policies and a market economy are of fundamental
                                importance to the process of economic development. Rising standards
                                of living contributed in a major way to the demographic transition
                                from high to low rates of population growth which occurred in the
                                U.S. and other industrialized countries over the last century.</p>
                            <p>The current situation of many developing countries, however, differs
                                in certain ways from conditions in 19th-century Europe and the U.S.
                                The rates and dimensions of population growth are much higher now,
                                the pressures on land, water, and resources are greater, the
                                safety-valve of migration is more restricted, and, perhaps most
                                important, time is not on their side because of the momentum of
                                demographic change.</p>
                            <p>The problem is not that population growth in itself is bad. The
                                problem is that rapid population growth compounds already serious
                                problems faced by both public and private sectors in accommodating
                                changing social and economic demands. It diverts resources from
                                needed capital investment to consumption, and increases the costs
                                and difficulties of economic development.</p>

                            <p>Population and family assistance policies and programs alone will not
                                achieve economic miracles. They are no substitute for sound economic
                                policies. Nevertheless, the governments of many developing countries
                                now believe that rapid population growth has itself become, in many
                                cases, an obstacle to the economic progress which should in time
                                lead to smaller family size and slower population growth. A broad
                                international consensus has emerged since the 1974 Bucharest World
                                Population Conference that economic development and population
                                policies are mutually reinforcing. This is why even <gloss

                            <p>Perhaps the most poignant consequence of rapid population growth is
                                its effect on the health of mothers and children. Especially in poor
                                countries, the health and nutrition status of women and children is
                                linked to family size. Maternal and infant mortality rises with the
                                number of births and with births too closely spaced. In countries as
                                different as Turkey, Peru, and Nepal, a child born less than two
                                years after its sibling is twice as likely to die before it reaches
                                the age of five, than if there were an interval of at least four
                                years between the births. Complications of pregnancy are more
                                frequent among women who are very young or near the end of their
                                reproductive years. In societies with widespread malnutrition and
                                inadequate health conditions, these problems are reinforced;
                                numerous and closely spaced births lead to even greater malnutrition
                                of mothers and infants.</p>

                            <p>The basic objective of all U.S. assistance, including population

                            <p>U.S. aid is designed to promote economic progress in developing
                                countries through encouraging sound economic policies and freeing of
                                individual initiative. Thus, the U.S. supports a broad range of
                                activities in various sectors, including agriculture, private
                                enterprise, science and technology, health, population, and
                                education. Population assistance, while important in concept,
                                amounts in monetary terms to only about ten percent of total
                                development assistance.</p>
                            <p>As population factors had been neglected in early aid programs, the
                                U.S. has in recent years taken an international leadership role in
                                encouraging other donors and international organizations to support
                                voluntary population programs as an important, cost-effective
                                component of development aid. There is now substantial evidence,
                                from countries with widely varying economic, social, and religious
                                backgrounds, that relatively inexpensive family assistance programs
                                can improve maternal and child health, bring down birth rates, and

                                City.</p>
                            <p>Because nearly all major <gloss target="#t_LDC_1">LDC</gloss>’s have
                                themselves adopted positions on population matters advanced by the
                                U.S. and its Western allies over the past twenty years, the U.S.
                                delegation need not be out front in Mexico City. Other countries
                                will, however, look for our support in strengthening the broad
                                consensus on population and development that has emerged over the
                                past several years.</p>
                            <p>Based on the above discussion, the following principles should be
                                drawn upon to guide the U.S. delegation at the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ICP_1">ICP</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>1. Population factors merit serious consideration in development
                                strategy, although they are not a substitute for sound economic
                                policies which liberate individual initiative through the market
                                mechanism.</p>
                            <p>2. Population policies and programs should be fully integrated into,
                                and reinforce, appropriate, market-oriented development policies;
                                their objective should be clearly seen as an improvement in the
                                human condition, and not merely an exercise in limiting numbers.</p>
                            <p>3. Access to family education and services needs to be significantly
                                expanded, especially in the context of maternal/child health
                                programs, in order to enable couples to exercise responsible
                                parenthood. Consistent with local values and customs, the U.S.
                                favors offering couples the widest practicable variety of medically
                                approved methods, including natural family planning.</p>
                            <p>4. Respect for human life is basic, and any attempt to use abortion,
                                involuntary sterilization, or other coercive measures in family
                                planning must be rejected.</p>
                            <p>5. National and international resources addressed to population
                                issues should be commensurate with the growing dimensions of the
                                problem.</p>
                            <p>6. There should be higher international priority for biomedical
                                research into safer and better methods of fertility regulation,
                                including <pb facs="0845" n="799" xml:id="pg_799"/> natural family
                                planning, and for operations research into more effective service
                                delivery and program management.</p>
                            <p>7. Issues of migration should be handled in ways consistent with both
                                human rights and national sovereignty.</p>
                            <p>8. The U.S., in cooperation with other concerned countries should
                                resist intrusion of polemical or non-germane issues into Conference
                                deliberations. In particular, a draft recommendation on disarmament
                                and the arms race,<note n="6" xml:id="d284fn6">In telegram 100230 to

                                should be rejected, although we can accept suitable language on the

                            the <gloss target="#t_NSC_1">NSC</gloss> paper as a sop. This was per

                            agreement with the abortion language. I, in turn, grafted the first four
                            pages of the <persName corresp="#p_SJA_1">Svahn</persName> paper to a
                            shortened version of our draft. (I first, of course, had to edit those
                            pages of the <persName corresp="#p_SJA_1">Svahn</persName> draft.) I
                            gave this rough redraft to Bud and <persName corresp="#p_CJW_1"

                        <p>For many years, the United States has supported, and helped to finance,

                            achieve a condition of population equilibrium. The differences that do
                            exist concern the choice of strategies and methods for the achievement
                            of that goal. The experience of the last two decades not only makes
                            possible but requires a sharper focus for our population policy. It
                            requires a more refined approach to problems which appear today in quite
                            a different light than they did twenty years ago.</p>
                        <p>First and most important, population growth is, of itself, a neutral
                            phenomenon. It is not necessarily good or ill. It becomes an asset or a
                            problem only in conjunction with other factors, such as economic policy,
                            social constraints, need for manpower, and so forth. The relationship
                            between population growth and economic development is not necessarily a
                            negative one. More people do not necessarily mean less growth. Indeed,
                            in the economic history of many nations, population growth has been an
                            essential element in economic progress.</p>
                        <p>Before the advent of governmental population programs, several factors
                            had combined to create an unprecedented surge in population over most of
                            the world. Although population levels in many industrialized nations had
                            reached or were approaching equilibrium in the period before the Second
                            World War, the baby boom that followed in its wake resulted in a
                            dramatic, but temporary, population “tilt” toward youth. The
                            disproportionate number of infants, children, teenagers, and eventually
                            young adults, did strain the social infrastructure of schools, health
                            facilities, law enforcement, and so forth. However, it also helped <pb
                                facs="0848" n="802" xml:id="pg_802"/> sustain strong economic
                            growth, despite occasionally counterproductive government policies.</p>
                        <p>Among the developing nations, a coincidential population increase was
                            caused by entirely different factors. A tremendous expansion of health
                            services—from simple inoculations to sophisticated surgery—saved
                            millions of lives every year. Emergency relief, facilitated by modern
                            transport, helped millions to survive flood, famine, and drought. The
                            sharing of technology, the teaching of agriculture and engineering, and
                            improvements in educational standards generally, all helped to reduce
                            mortality rates, especially infant mortality, and to lengthen life
                            spans.</p>
                        <p>This demonstrated not poor planning or bad policy but human progress in a
                            new era of international assistance, technological advance, and human
                            compassion. The population boom was a challenge; it need not have been a
                            crisis. Seen in its broader context, it required a measured, modulated
                            response. It provoked an overreaction by some, largely, because it
                            coincided with two negative factors which, together, hindered families
                            and nations in adapting to their changing circumstances.</p>
                        <p>The first of these factors was governmental control of economies, a
                            development which effectively constrained economic growth. The post-war
                            experience consistently demonstrated that, as economic decision-making
                            was concentrated in the hands of planners and public officials, the
                            ability of average men and women to work towards a better future was
                            impaired, and sometimes crippled. In many cases, agriculture was
                            devastated by government price-fixing that wiped out rewards for labor.
                            Job creation in infant industries was hampered by confiscatory taxes.
                            Personal industry and thrift were penalized, while dependence upon the
                            state was encouraged. Political considerations made it difficult for an
                            economy to adjust to changes in supply and demand or to disruptions in
                            world trade and finance. Under such circumstances, population growth
                            changed from an asset in the development of economic potential to a
                            peril.</p>
                        <p>One of the consequences of this “economic statism” was that it disrupted
                            the natural mechanism for slowing population growth in problem areas.
                            The world’s more affluent nations have reached a population equilibrium
                            without compulsion and, in most cases, even before it was government
                            policy to achieve it. The controlling factor in these cases has been the
                            adjustment, by individual families, of reproductive behavior to economic
                            opportunity and aspiration. Historically, as opportunities and the
                            standard of living rise, the birth rate falls. In many countries,
                            economic freedom has led to economically rational behavior.</p>
                        <p>That pattern might be well under way in many nations where population
                            growth is today a problem, if counterproductive govern<pb facs="0849"
                                n="803" xml:id="pg_803"/>ment policies had not disrupted economic
                            incentives, rewards, and advancement. In this regard, localized crises
                            of population growth are, in part, evidence of too much government
                            control and planning, rather than too little.</p>
                        <p>The second factor that turned the population boom into a crisis was
                            confined to the western world. It was an outbreak of an
                            anti-intellectualism, which attacked science, technology, and the very
                            concept of material progress. Joined to a commendable and long overdue
                            concern for the environment, it was more a reflection of anxiety about
                            unsettled times and an uncertain future. In its disregard of human
                            experience and scientific sophistication, it was not unlike other waves
                            of cultural anxiety that have swept through western civilization during
                            times of social stress and scientific exploration.</p>
                        <p>The combination of these two factors—counterproductive economic policies
                            in poor and struggling nations, and a pessimism among the more
                            advanced—led to a demographic overreaction in the 1960’s and 1970’s.
                            Scientific forecasts were required to compete with unsound, extremist
                            scenarios, and too many governments pursued population control measures
                            without sound economic policies that create the rise in living standards
                            historically associated with decline in fertility rates. This approach
                            has not worked, primarily because it has focused on a symptom and
                            neglected the underlying ailments. For the last three years, this
                            Administration has sought to reverse that approach. We recognize that,
                            in some cases, immediate population pressures may require short-term
                            efforts to ameliorate them. But population control programs alone cannot
                            substitute for the economic reforms that put a society on the road
                            toward growth and, as an aftereffect, toward slower population increase
                            as well.</p>
                        <p>Nor can population control substitute for the rapid and responsible
                            development of natural resources. In commenting on the Global 2000
                            report, this Administration in 1981 disagreed with its call “for more
                            governmental supervision and control,”<note n="2" xml:id="d286fn2">Not

                            their relationship to social and political pressures, especially in the
                            developing nations, the Administration places a priority upon
                            technological advance and economic expansion, which hold out the hope of
                            prosperity and stability of a rapidly changing world. That hope can be
                            realized, of course, only to the extent that government’s response to
                            problems, whether economic or ecological, respects and enhances <pb

                        <p>The world’s rapid population growth is a recent phenomenon. Only several
                            decades ago, the population of developing countries was relatively
                            stable, the result of a balance between high fertility and high
                            mortality. There are now 4.5 billion people in the world, and six
                            billion are projected by the year 2000. Such rapid growth places
                            tremendous pressures on governments without concomitant economic
                            growth.</p>
                        <p>The International Conference on Population offers the U.S. an opportunity
                            to strengthen the international consensus on the interrelationships
                            between economic development and population which has emerged since the
                            last such conference in Bucharest in 1974. Our primary objective will be
                            to encourage developing countries to adopt sound economic policies and,
                            where appropriate, population policies consistent with respect for human
                            dignity and family values. As President <persName corresp="#p_RRW_1"
                                >Reagan</persName> stated in his message to the Mexico City

                            families, and respectful of religious and cultural values. When they
                            are, such programs can make an important contribution to economic and
                            social development, to the health of mothers and children, and to the
                            stability of the family and of society.”</p>
                        <p>U.S. support for family planning programs is based on respect for human
                            life, enhancement of human dignity, and strengthening of the family.
                            Attempts to use abortion, involuntary sterilization, or other coercive
                            measures in family planning must be shunned, whether exercised against
                            families within a society or against nations within the family of

                        <p>The United Nations Declaration of the Rights of the Child [1959]<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d286fn4">Brackets in the original.</note> calls for
                            legal protection for children before birth as well as after birth. In
                            keeping with this obligation, the United States does not consider
                            abortion an acceptable element of family planning programs and will no
                            longer contribute to those of which it is a part. Accordingly, when
                            dealing with nations which support abortion with funds not provided by
                            the United States Government, the United States will contribute to such
                            nations through segregated accounts which cannot be used for <pb
                                facs="0851" n="805" xml:id="pg_805"/> abortion. Moreover, the United
                            States will no longer contribute to separate nongovernmental
                            organizations which perform or actively promote abortion as a method of
                            family planning in other nations. With regard to the United Nations Fund
                            for Population Activities (<gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss>),
                            the U.S. will insist that no part of its contribution be used for
                            abortion. The U.S. will also call for concrete assurances that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss> is not engaged in, or does
                            not provide funding for, abortion or coercive family planning programs;
                            if such assurances are not forthcoming, the U.S. will redirect the
                            amount of its contribution to other, non-<gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1"
                                >UNFPA</gloss>, family planning programs.</p>
                        <p>In addition, when efforts to lower population growth are deemed
                            advisable, U.S. policy considers it imperative that such efforts respect
                            the religious beliefs and culture of each society, and the right of
                            couples to determine the size of their own families. Accordingly, the
                            U.S. will not provide family planning funds to any nation which engages
                            in forcible coercion to achieve population growth objectives.</p>
                        <p>U.S. Government authorities will immediately begin negotiations to
                            implement the above policies with the appropriate governments and
                            organizations.</p>
                        <p>It is time to put additional emphasis upon those root problems which
                            frequently exacerbate population pressures, but which have too often
                            been given scant attention. By focusing upon real remedies for
                            underdeveloped economies, the International Conference on Population can
                            reduce demographic issues to their proper place. It is an important
                            place, but not the controlling one. It requires our continuing attention
                            within the broader context of economic growth and of the economic
                            freedom that is its prerequisite.</p>

                        <p>Conservative projections indicate that, in the sixty years from 1950 to
                            2010, many Third World countries will experience four, five, or even
                            sixfold increases in the size of their populations. Even under the
                            assumption of gradual declines in birth rates, the unusually high
                            proportion of youth in the Third World means that the annual population
                            growth in many of these countries will continue to increase for the next
                            several decades.</p>
                        <p>Sound economic policies and a market economy are of fundamental
                            importance to the process of economic development. Rising standards of
                            living contributed in a major way to the demographic transition from
                            high to low rates of population growth which occurred in the U.S. and
                            other industrialized countries over the last century.</p>
                        <p>The current situation of many developing countries, however, differs in
                            certain ways from conditions in 19th century Europe and the U.S. The
                            rates and dimensions of population growth are much higher <pb
                                facs="0852" n="806" xml:id="pg_806"/> now, the pressures on land,
                            water, and resources are greater, the safety-valve of migration is more
                            restricted, and, perhaps most important, time is not on their side
                            because of the momentum of demographic change.</p>
                        <p>Rapid population growth compounds already serious problems faced by both
                            public and private sectors in accommodating changing social and economic
                            demands. It diverts resources from needed investment, and increases the
                            costs and difficulties of economic development. Slowing population
                            growth is not a panacea for the problems of social and economic
                            development. It is not offered as a substitute for sound and
                            comprehensive development policies which encourage a vital private
                            sector, it cannot solve problems of hunger, unemployment, crowding, or
                            social disorder.</p>
                        <p>Population assistance is an ingredient of a comprehensive program that
                            focuses on the root causes of development failures. The U.S. program as
                            a whole, including population assistance, lays the basis for
                            well-grounded, step-by-step initiatives to improve the well-being of
                            people in developing countries and to make their own efforts,
                            particularly through expanded private sector initiatives, a key building
                            block of development programs.</p>
                        <p>Fortunately, a broad international consensus has emerged since the 1974
                            Bucharest World Population Conference that economic development and
                            population policies are mutually reinforcing.</p>
                        <p>By helping developing countries slow their population growth through
                            support for effective voluntary family planning programs, in conjunction
                            with sound economic policies, U.S. population assistance contributes to
                            stronger saving and investment rates, speeds the development of
                            effective markets and related employment opportunities, reduces the
                            potential resource requirements of programs to improve the health and
                            education of the people, and hastens the achievement of each country’s
                            graduation from the need for external assistance.</p>
                        <p>The United States will continue its long-standing commitment to
                            development assistance, of which population programs are a part. We
                            recognize the importance of providing our assistance within the
                            cultural, economic, and political context of the countries we are
                            assisting, and in keeping with our own values.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">HEALTH AND HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the most poignant consequence of rapid population growth is its
                            effect on the health of mothers and children. Especially in poor
                            countries, the health and nutrition status of women and children is
                            linked to family size. Maternal and infant mortality rises with the
                            number of births and with births too closely spaced. In countries as
                            different as Turkey, Peru, and Nepal, a child born less than two years
                            after its sibling is twice as likely to die before it reaches the age of
                            five, <pb facs="0853" n="807" xml:id="pg_807"/> than if there were an
                            interval of at least four years between the births. Complications of
                            pregnancy are more frequent among women who are very young or near the
                            end of their reproductive years. In societies with widespread
                            malnutrition and inadequate health conditions, these problems are
                            reinforced; numerous and closely spaced births lead to even greater
                            malnutrition of mothers and infants.</p>
                        <p>It is an unfortunate reality that, in many countries, abortion is used as
                            a means of terminating unwanted pregnancies. This is unnecessary and
                            repugnant; voluntary family assistance programs can provide a humane
                            alternative to abortion for couples who wish to regulate the size of
                            their family, and evidence from some developing countries indicates a
                            decline in abortion as such services become available.</p>
                        <p>The basic objective of all U.S. assistance, including population
                            programs, is the betterment of the human condition—improving the quality
                            of life of mothers and children, of families, and of communities for
                            generations to come. For we recognize that people are the ultimate
                            resource—but this means happy and healthy children, growing up with
                            education, finding productive work as young adults, and able to develop
                            their full mental and physical potential.</p>
                        <p>U.S. aid is designed to promote economic progress in developing countries
                            through encouraging sound economic policies and freeing of individual
                            initiative. Thus, the U.S. supports a broad range of activities in
                            various sectors, including agriculture, private enterprise, science and
                            technology, health, population, and education. Population assistance
                            amounts to about ten percent of total development assistance.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">TECHNOLOGY AS A KEY TO DEVELOPMENT</p>
                        <p>The transfer, adaptation, and improvement of modern know-how is central
                            to U.S. development assistance. People with greater know-how are people
                            better able to improve their lives. Population assistance ensures that a
                            wide range of modern demographic technology is made available to
                            developing countries and that technological improvements critical for
                            successful development receive support.</p>
                        <p>The efficient collection, processing, and analysis of data derived from
                            census, survey, and vital statistics programs contribute to better
                            planning in both the public and private sectors.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">THE U.S. AT MEXICO CITY</p>
                        <p>In conjunction with the above statements of policy, the following
                            principles should be drawn upon to guide the U.S. delegation at the
                            International Conference on Population:</p>
                        <p>—1. Respect for human life is basic, and any attempt to use abortion,
                            involuntary sterilization or other coercive measures in family planning
                            must be rejected.</p>
                        <pb facs="0854" n="808" xml:id="pg_808"/>
                        <p>—2. Population policies and programs should be fully integrated into, and
                            reinforce, appropriate, market-oriented development policies; their
                            objective should be clearly seen as an improvement in the human
                            condition, and not merely an exercise in limiting births.</p>
                        <p>—3. Access to family education and services needs to be broadened,
                            especially in the context of maternal/child health programs, in order to
                            enable couples to exercise responsible parenthood. Consistent with
                            values and customs, the U.S. favors offering couples a variety of
                            medically approved methods.</p>
                        <p>—4. Though population factors merit serious consideration in development
                            strategy, they are not a substitute for sound economic policies which
                            liberate individual initiative through the market mechanism.</p>
                        <p>—5. There should be higher international priority for biomedical research
                            into safer and better methods of fertility regulation, especially
                            natural family planning, and for operations research into more effective
                            service delivery and program management.</p>
                        <p>—6. Issues of migration should be handled in ways consistent with both
                            human rights and national sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>—7. The U.S., in cooperation with other concerned countries, should
                            resist intrusion of polemical or non-germane issues into conference
                            deliberations.</p>

                        <p>The Bucharest conference was held at the behest of the developed
                            countries to encourage developing countries to reduce high rates of
                            population growth. Delegates from Algeria, Argentina, and Brazil, amid
                            heated north-south and east-west rhetoric, turned the conference into a
                            long acrimonious debate over whether resources should be put into
                            restraining population growth or into accelerating economic development.

                        <p>Many developing country delegates argued that only more rapid economic
                            development—requiring a restructuring of the world’s economic
                            system—would bring about a reduction in their national population growth

                        <p>The “either development or family planning” argument of the 1974
                            Bucharest conference has, for the most part, given way to agreement that
                            both economic development and family planning programs must be
                            successful if population growth rates are to continue to fall. Unlike
                            1974—the year of quadrupled oil prices and developing country optimism
                            that OPEC leverage would propel them to prosperity and lower population
                            growth—1984 is a year with a weak oil market and a growing sense in many
                            developing countries that economic growth will be slow and difficult to
                            sustain. Developing country statements in the 1980s, while continuing to
                            stress that accelerated economic growth will stimulate demand for family
                            planning services, more frequently have stated that rapid population
                            growth is neutralizing per capita economic gains. [<hi rend="italic"

                        <p>The latest evaluations of global trends by the United Nations Population
                            Division show that the world’s population growth rate has only edged
                            downward in desultory fashion from 1.9–2.0 percent in the early 1970s to
                            the current rate of 1.7–1.8 percent (Table). The number of developing
                            countries with organized family planning programs has increased,
                            however, from 55 to 72 and most developing countries have sustained
                            modest rates of economic growth during the 1970s. [<hi rend="italic"

                                halved its growth rate the past decade by advocating programs to
                                limit childbearing to one or two children per family.</p>
                            <p>—In the developing countries, excluding China, the average annual
                                growth rate has plateaued during the decade at about 2.4
                                percent.</p>
                            <p>—In Africa, population growth rates increased from 2.7 to 3.0 percent
                                between 1974 and 1984, as death rate declines outpaced small birth

                        <p>Delegates to the Second African Population Conference identified
                            rural-urban migration, and corollary problems of rural development and
                            agricultural self-sufficiency, as their highest priorities for action at
                            Mexico City. African delegates view the Mexico City meeting as a
                            conference on rural economic development, not fertility reduction. In
                            their plan of action, “The Kilimanjaro Objectives on Population,” they
                            affirmed support for child-spacing as a health measure and indicated
                            interest in fertility reduction as a consequence of economic
                            development. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not

                        <p>The “Amman Declaration on Population and Development” stresses the
                            inseparability of population change and socioeconomic development.
                            Conferees argued that families must experience improved economic
                            circumstances before couples will decide to reduce family size. They
                            specifically rejected family planning separate from economic development
                            as a means for reducing population growth in the Arab world. [<hi

                        <p>Delegates to the Havana preparatory meetings emphasized the primacy of
                            the family in population matters. Papers and discussions underscored the
                            rights of individuals to freely decide the number and spacing of their
                            children. The consensus of the delegates was that countries in the
                            region suffering from problems caused by the depressed global economic
                            situation could not fully implement social, population, or development
                            programs. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not declassified</hi>]</p>

                        <p>Delegates to the Asian Forum of Parliamentarians drafted a declaration
                            which—in contrast to other regional positions—calls for determined
                            intervention by governments to reduce population growth and mortality
                            rates. The legislators identified the following goals:</p>
                        <p>—A reduction in the overall Asian growth rate to one percent by the year
                            2000.</p>
                        <p>—A decrease in mortality rates, particularly infant mortality rates, by
                            50 percent by the year 2000.</p>
                        <p>—A balanced distribution of population through policies to accommodate
                            planned urban growth as well as to retain population in rural areas.

                            consensus before the August meetings, several unresolved substantive and

                        <p>We believe the Soviets have maneuvered deliberately since their

                            City from which they can assail the United States. The Soviet Union has
                            a resolution before the conference which states that the problems of
                            population growth and economic development can only be resolved
                            successfully under conditions of world peace, disarmament, security, and
                            cooperation among nations. The Soviet and Eastern Bloc delegations
                            emphasized in all preparatory sessions that East-West disarmament and
                            security matters should override population and economic development
                            issues. The United States and other conference organizers were
                            unsuccessful in moving the Soviets’ peace and disarmament language to
                            the preamble of the conference document where formal debate and action
                            would not be required. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not

                        <p>Moscow, in our view, will try to dominate and manipulate developing
                            country media coverage during the week of the conference. The Soviets
                            and their Eastern bloc allies may commandeer large chunks of the scant
                            27–36 total hours available for debate to embarrass the United States
                            with peace and disarmament speeches. The <gloss target="#t_USSR_1"
                                >USSR</gloss> successfully introduced language to weaken the
                            organizers’ plans to limit each delegation’s remarks to seven minutes on
                            all action items. Conference delegates will be told only that it is
                            “desirable” that they limit their remarks to seven minutes. [<hi

                        <p>Differences between the developed and developing country delegations in
                            the relative importance that they attach to the two strategies for
                            reducing population growth rates—economic development and family
                            planning—may polarize the conference along North-South lines as in 1974.
                            Moreover, conservatives representing major religions in the Middle East,
                            Africa, North America and at the Vatican have indicated that they may
                            urge Mexico City conferees to eliminate support for specific family
                            planning programs that they view as state interference in private family
                            decisions. [<hi rend="italic">portion marking not declassified</hi>]</p>

                        <p>The Declaration will receive widespread support from conference delegates
                            as well as substantial media coverage. [<hi rend="italic">portion

                            specific national fertility-reduction targets. Countries will still be
                            encouraged by the 1984 World Population Plan of Action to set such

                            U.S. treatment of it prior to the August 6–14 Mexico City Conference. In
                            view of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJL_2">Buckley</persName>’s
                            unusual statement at the August 14 plenary of the Conference, concerning
                            “a misjudgment on the part of our representative at the preparatory
                            committee,” and referring to an “error” and a “hasty decision about a
                            complex issue beyond his area of expertise, with predictable results”

                            Conference on this particular recommendation.</p>
                        <p>There was no mention of occupied territory either in the draft
                            recommendations prepared by the Secretariat for the January 23–27
                            (first) preparatory committee meeting, nor in the debate at that
                            meeting, nor in the revised draft presented to the March 12–16 second
                            preparatory committee.</p>
                        <p>A recommendation (then numbered 34) was introduced, in writing and
                            without comment, by Senegal on the last afternoon of the March meeting,
                            under the section on “population distribution and internal migration.”
                            The U.S. was represented at that meeting by Harold Fleming of <gloss
                                target="#t_USUN_1">USUN</gloss>, Phil Claxton, private sector
                            consultant, and me, as head of delegation.</p>
                        <p>While we noted that the language potentially applied to Israel, it was
                            clear that, in the <hi rend="italic">absence of any specific
                                mention</hi> of Israel, it could also apply to other international
                            situations (as later admitted by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJL_2"
                                >Buckley</persName> in an August 14 plenary statement). We also
                            ascertained that the U.S. had, in fact, signed the Geneva Convention
                            referred to in the text.</p>
                        <p>Our decision at this point was influenced by our experience with the
                            disarmament recommendation, no. 5. We and others had objected to an
                            original Secretariat draft recommendation. The Soviets then tabled even
                            more objectionable language, which was followed by prolonged, useless,
                            and inconclusive debate.</p>
                        <p>Our judgment on March 16 was that, if we now made an issue over
                            recommendation 34, we ran the risk of attracting new language which <hi
                                rend="italic">would</hi> specifically mention Israel.<note n="9"
                                xml:id="d289fn9"><persName corresp="#p_DKW_1">Dam</persName>
                                underlined this sentence.</note> Our decision was also influenced by
                            the understanding that consensus actions of a preparatory committee are
                            provisional and non-binding, and that all recommendations are <hi
                                rend="italic">de facto</hi> open for further review at the main
                            Conference.</p>
                        <p>As no objection was raised by Israel to the Senegal proposal, we felt
                            that the preferable U.S. course was not to interpret it as anti-Israel,
                            thereby provoking a debate which would almost surely lead to specific
                            mention of Israeli settlements (which, in the event, is what happened at
                            Mexico City), but rather to review the matter in Washington in the
                            course of preparing U.S. positions for the August Conference.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, all of the recommendations were circulated for review by
                            State and <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> offices following their
                            publication by the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Secretariat in

                            formal position papers were requested, with recommendation 34 again
                            being noted for special attention.<note n="10" xml:id="d289fn10">A

                            Declaration on Population and Development (text follows) and

                                Policy File, D840195–0141)</note> took place in a separate main
                            committee meeting, chaired by Fred Sai of Ghana, which met in 14
                            sessions.</p>
                        <p>4. Initial main committee sessions focused on lengthy procedural debates
                            and minor changes in introductory text. By mid-week, only 12
                            introductory paragraphs had been reviewed, leaving 11 introductory
                            paragraphs, the preamble, and 85 recommendations still to be examined.
                            Pressures of short time frame and growing familiarity with the
                            negotiating process helped subsequent meetings to move more quickly
                            through the text, nevertheless, discussions of procedural questions and
                            non-germane political issues continued to interrupt the sessions.</p>
                        <p>5. Main committee focused much time and energy on two extraneous issues,
                            disarmament and illegal settlements in occupied territories, which
                            appeared as recommendations in the text prepared at the PrepComs. The
                            disarmament recommendation, supported by the Eastern bloc, was strongly
                            opposed by the Western countries and Japan as inappropriate for
                            discussion at a population conference. An informal working group of
                            interested parties was established to reach a compromise. The issue was
                            settled by moving less strident language on the links between peace and
                            development to a new section entitled “Peace, Security and Population”
                            which appears between the preamble and the recommendations.</p>
                        <p>6. The settlements recommendation, which interpreted Article 49 of the
                            Geneva Convention as “condemning” the “illegal” establishment of
                            settlements in territories occupied by force, proved more difficult to
                            resolve. The recommendation’s Arab supporters insisted upon retaining
                            the offending language, even after the Secretariat and Conference
                            President worked with interested parties on a compromise redraft. The
                            U.S. and Israel, who objected strongly to the introduction of this
                            divisive political issue and to the recommendation’s interpretation of
                            Article 49, insisted that the offending language be dropped from the
                            text. With no compromise possible, the U.S. called for a vote on the
                            competency of the conference to make such an interpretation. While
                            considerable doubt on this issue was expressed (over half of the
                            delegations abstained on this vote), only two countries voted “no” with
                            the U.S. and the effort was defeated. The original language was approved
                            by the main committee, with strong objections by the U.S. and Israel,
                            and sent to the plenary with the other recommendations. The final
                            plenary session again took up the issue with similar results—only the
                                <pb facs="0868" n="822" xml:id="pg_822"/> U.S. and Israel opposed
                            the recommendation. The U.S., although joining the consensus on the
                            recommendations document, expressed formal reservation on this paragraph
                            and insisted that its reservation be recorded in the document. FYI: The
                            U.S. also formally clarified its interpretation of a recommendation
                            concerning action on improving earnings from commodity exports and on
                            increasing bilateral and multilateral lending, to underline that U.S.
                            endorsement of the recommendations document did not change known U.S.
                            positions on commodity agreements or future lending resources for
                            international financial institutions. End FYI.</p>
                        <p>7. On population issues there was little disagreement. Delegates
                            recognized that progress has been made in the past 10 years in pursuing
                            the objectives of the <gloss target="#t_WPPA_1">WPPA</gloss> to improve
                            the quality of life of the world’s inhabitants, but concluded that much
                            remains to be done. Countries recognized that socio-economic development
                            is essential to achieving national population objectives and that
                            population and development programs are mutually reinforcing. Strong
                            support for the basic rights of couples and individuals to decide
                            freely, responsibly, and without coercion the number and spacing of
                            their children was voiced. To this end, countries agreed that family
                            planning information, education and means should, as a matter of
                            urgency, be made universally available (with the exception of abortion,
                            which countries stated in no case should be promoted as a method of
                            family planning). The conference paid particular attention to the role
                            and status of women; governments were urged to integrate women fully
                            into all phases of the development process. Additional resources were
                            called for in research on human reproduction and fertility regulation,
                            in order to improve the safety and efficacy of existing family planning
                            methods. Governments and multilateral organizations were urged to
                            increase the level of assistance or, in the case of developing
                            countries, allocate increased resources for population activities.
                            Non-governmental organizations were urged to continue their pioneering
                            role in the population field.</p>
                        <p>8. The new U.S. population policy and its perceived implications
                            attracted considerable attention at the <gloss target="#t_ICP_1"
                                >ICP</gloss>. The U.S. Delegation, headed by Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJL_2">James Buckley</persName>, clarified the new
                            policy, stating that it does not reflect radical change; rather, it
                            signifies a sharpening of the focus of our foreign assistance program in
                            this area. That policy does, however, combine U.S. population and
                            economic development policies in a comprehensive whole, and stresses the
                            critical role economic reform plays in achieving the stated goals of the
                                <gloss target="#t_WPPA_1">WPPA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>9. Much of the concern focused on the new U.S. abortion policy. The
                            delegation stated that it is U.S. policy to withhold funding from
                            private organizations that perform or actively promote abortion abroad.
                            Funds are not withheld from a nation which includes abortion in family
                                <pb facs="0869" n="823" xml:id="pg_823"/> planning programs,
                            provided American contributions are placed in segregated accounts. This
                            policy will not affect the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> Fund for
                            Population Activities with respect to the FY 1984 contribution since the
                            U.S. has officially accepted the fund’s affirmation that its policies
                            support neither abortion nor coercive programs.</p>
                        <p>10. As evidence of its support for international family planning
                            programs, the delegation pointed out that the U.S. will provide $240
                            million for such programs in FY 1984 (or 44 percent of the total amount
                            contributed by developed countries for such programs). In addition, the
                            administration has requested from Congress an increase in international
                            family planning funding for FY 1985.</p>
                        <p>11. Wide agreement on population issues at the conference is illustrated
                            by the “Mexico City Declaration on Population and Development” which
                            delegates approved by consensus, without reservation.</p>
                        <p>Begin text:<note n="7" xml:id="d290fn7">An unknown hand drew an arrow to
                                the left of this phrase.</note></p>
                        <p>1. The International Conference on Population met in Mexico City from 6
                            to 14 August 1984 to appraise the implementation of the World Population
                            Plan of Action, adopted by consensus at Bucharest, ten years ago. The
                            conference reaffirmed the full validity of the principles and objectives
                            of the World Population Plan of Action and adopted a set of
                            recommendations for the further implementation of the plan in the years
                            ahead.</p>
                        <p>2. The world has undergone far-reaching changes in the past decade.
                            Significant progress in many fields important for human welfare has been
                            made through national and international efforts. However, for a large
                            number of countries it has been a period of instability, increased
                            unemployment, mounting external indebtedness, stagnation and even
                            decline in economic growth. The number of people living in absolute
                            poverty has increased.</p>
                        <p>3. Economic difficulties and problems of resource mobilization have been
                            particularly serious in the developing countries. Growing international
                            disparities have further exacerbated already serious problems in social
                            and economic terms. Firm and widespread hope was expressed that
                            increasing international co-operation will lead to a growth in welfare
                            and wealth, their just and equitable distribution and minimal waste in
                            use of resources, thereby promoting development and peace for the
                            benefit of the world’s population.</p>
                        <p>4. Population growth, high mortality and morbidity and migration problems
                            continue to be causes of great concern requiring immediate action.</p>
                        <pb facs="0870" n="824" xml:id="pg_824"/>
                        <p>5. The conference confirms that the principal aim of social, economic and
                            human development, of which population goals and policies are integral
                            parts, is to improve the standards of living and quality of life of the
                            people. This declaration constitutes a solemn undertaking by the nations
                            and international organizations gathered in Mexico City to respect
                            national sovereignty to combat all forms of racial discrimination
                            including apartheid, and to promote social and economic development,
                            human rights and individual freedom.</p>
                        <p>6. Since Bucharest the global population growth rate has declined from
                            2.03 to 1.67 percent per year. In the next decade the growth rate will
                            decline more slowly. Moreover, the annual increase in numbers is
                            expected to continue and may reach 90 million by the year 2000. Ninety
                            percent of that increase will occur in developing countries and at that
                            time 6.1 billion people are expected to inhabit the earth.</p>
                        <p>7. Demographic differences between developed and developing countries
                            remain striking. The average life expectancy at birth, which has
                            increased almost everywhere, is 73 years in developed countries, while
                            in developing countries it is only 57 years and families in developing
                            countries tend to be much larger than elsewhere. This gives cause for
                            concern since social and population pressures may contribute to the
                            continuation of the wide disparity in welfare and the quality of life
                            between developing and developed countries.</p>
                        <p>8. In the past decade, population issues have been increasingly
                            recognized as a fundamental element in development planning. To be
                            realistic, development policies, plans and programmes must reflect the
                            inextricable links between population, resources, environment and
                            development. Priority should be given to action programmes integrating
                            all essential population and development factors, taking fully into
                            account the need for rational utilization of natural resources and
                            protection of the physical environment and preventing its further
                            deterioration.</p>
                        <p>9. The experience with population policies in recent years is
                            encouraging. Mortality and morbidity rates have been lowered, although
                            not to the desired extent. Family planning programmes have been
                            successful in reducing fertility at relatively low cost. Countries which
                            consider that their population growth rate hinders their national
                            development plans should adopt appropriate population policies and
                            programmes. Timely action could avoid the accentuation of problems such
                            as overpopulation, unemployment, food shortages, and environmental
                            degradation.</p>
                        <p>10. Population and development policies reinforce each other when they
                            are responsive to individual, family and community needs. Experience
                            from the past decades demonstrates the necessity of the full
                            participation by the entire community and grass-roots organizations in
                            the <pb facs="0871" n="825" xml:id="pg_825"/> design and implementation
                            of policies and programmes. This will ensure that programmes are
                            relevant to local needs and in keeping with personal and social values.
                            It will also promote social awareness of demographic problems.</p>
                        <p>11. Improving the status of women and enhancing their role is an
                            important goal in itself and will also influence family life and size in
                            a positive way. Community support is essential to bring about the full
                            integration and participation of women into all phases and functions of
                            the development process. Institutional, economic and cultural barriers
                            must be removed and broad and swift action taken to assist women in
                            attaining full equality with men in the social, political and economic
                            life of their communities. To achive these goals, it is necessary for
                            men and women to share jointly responsibilities in areas such as family
                            life, child-caring and family planning. Governments should formulate and
                            implement concrete policies which would enhance the status and role of
                            women.</p>
                        <p>12. Unwanted high fertility adversely affects the health and welfare of
                            individuals and families, especially among the poor, and seriously
                            impedes social and economic progress in many countries. Women and
                            children are the main victims of unregulated fertility. Too many, too
                            close, too early and too late pregnancies are a major cause of maternal,
                            infant and childhood mortality and morbidity.</p>
                        <p>13. Although considerable progress has been made since Bucharest,
                            millions of people still lack access to safe and effective family
                            planning methods. By the year 2000 some 1.6 billion women will be of
                            childbearing age, 1.3 billion of them in developing countries. Major
                            efforts must be made now to ensure that all couples and individuals can
                            exercise their basic human right to decide freely, responsibly and
                            without coercion, the number and spacing of their children and to have
                            the information, education and means to do so. In exercising this right,
                            the best interests of their living and future children as well as the
                            responsibility towards the community should be taken into account.</p>
                        <p>14. Although modern contraceptive technology has brought considerable
                            progress into family planning programmes, increased funding is required
                            in order to develop new methods and to improve the safety, efficacy and
                            acceptability of existing methods. Expanded research should also be
                            undertaken in human reproduction to solve problems of infertility and
                            subfecundity.</p>
                        <p>15. As part of the overall goal to improve the health standards for all
                            people, special attention should be given to maternal and child health
                            services within a primary health care system. Through breast-feeding,
                            adequate nutrition, clean water, immunization programmes, oral
                            rehydration therapy and birth spacing, a virtual revolution in child
                            survival could be achieved. The impact would be dramatic in humanitarian
                            and fertility terms.</p>
                        <pb facs="0872" n="826" xml:id="pg_826"/>
                        <p>16. The coming decades will see rapid changes in population structures
                            with marked regional variations. The absolute numbers of children and
                            youth in developing countries will continue to rise so rapidly that
                            special programmes will be necessary to respond to their needs and
                            aspirations, including productive employment. Aging of populations is a
                            phenomenon which many countries will experience. This issue requires
                            attention particularly in developed countries in view of its social
                            implications and the active contribution the aged can make to the
                            social, cultural and economic life in their countries.</p>
                        <p>17. Rapid urbanization will continue to be a salient feature. By the end
                            of the century, 3 billion people, 48 percent of the world’s population,
                            might live in cities, frequently very large cities. Integrated urban and
                            rural development strategies should therefore be an essential part of
                            population policies. They should be based on a full evaluation of the
                            costs and benefits to individuals, groups and regions involved, should
                            respect basic human rights and use incentives rather than restrictive
                            measures.</p>
                        <p>18. The volume and nature of international migratory movements continue
                            to undergo rapid changes. Illegal or undocumented migration and refugee
                            movements have gained particular importance; labour migration of
                            considerable magnitude occurs in all regions. The outflow of skills
                            remains a serious human resource problem in many developing countries.
                            It is indispensable to safeguard the individual and social rights of the
                            persons involved and to protect them from exploitation and treatment not
                            in conformity with basic human rights; it is also necessary to guide
                            these different migration streams. To achieve this, the co-operation of
                            countries of origin and destination and the assistance of international
                            organizations are required.</p>
                        <p>19. As the years since 1974 have shown, the political commitment of heads
                            of state and other leaders and the willingness of governments to take
                            the lead in formulating population programmes and allocating the
                            necessary resources are crucial for the further implementation of the
                            world population plan of action. Governments should attach high priority
                            to the attainment of self-reliance in the management of such programmes,
                            strengthen their administrative and managerial capabilities, and ensure
                            co-ordination of international assistance at the national level.</p>
                        <p>20. The years since Bucharest have also shown that international
                            co-operation in the field of population is essential for the
                            implementation of recommendations agreed upon by the international
                            community and can be notably successful. The need for increased
                            resources for population activities is emphasized. Adequate and
                            substantial international support and assistance will greatly facilitate
                            the efforts of governments. It should be provided wholeheartedly and in
                            a spirit of universal <pb facs="0873" n="827" xml:id="pg_827"/>
                            solidarity and enlightened self-interest. The United Nations family
                            should continue to perform its vital responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>21. Non-governmental organizations have a continuing important role in
                            the implementation of the world population plan of action and deserve
                            encouragement and support from governments and international
                            organizations. Members of parliament, community leaders, scientists, the
                            media and others in influential positions are called upon to assist in
                            all aspects of population and development work.</p>
                        <p>22. At Bucharest, the world was made aware of the gravity and magnitude
                            of the population problems and their close interrelationship with
                            economic and social development. The message of Mexico City is to forge
                            ahead with effective implementation of the world population plan of
                            action aimed at improving standards of living and quality of life for
                            all peoples of this planet in promotion of their common destiny in peace
                            and security.</p>
                        <p>23. In issuing this declaration, all participants at the international
                            conference on population reiterate their commitment and rededicate
                            themselves to the further implementation of the plan. End text.</p>

                                <salute>Dear Jim:</salute>
                            </opener>
                            <p>I very much appreciate your August 31 letter recounting your
                                experiences as Head of Delegation at the World Population Conference
                                in Mexico City. Public focus on extraneous issues at that Conference
                                has tended to obscure its record of achievement, including the 87
                                recommendations based on honest consensus.</p>
                            <p>Your letter discussed our role in preparing for future multilateral
                                conferences, participation in preparatory committees, and
                                backstopping in the Department. We have reviewed our preparations
                                and current practices. The preparations for this conference involved
                                careful work by many Department officials, including specialists in
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> political issues, over a
                                period of nearly three years. We take seriously the need for close
                                political oversight of technical conferences of specialized <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> agencies. The kind of difficulties
                                you encountered in Mexico City are, unfortunately, not unusual in
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> conferences. In this regard,
                                we continue to update, and have reissued, our general guidance on
                                political issues for U.S. delegations at all international
                                conferences.</p>
                            <p>Finally, you raise a most interesting point about the dilemma we face
                                in combatting non-germane political issues in essentially technical
                                conferences. As you know, one of our major policy goals is to resist
                                politicization of the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> system, and
                                to eliminate it wherever possible. In pursuit of this goal, we have
                                a range of options including whether to join or deny consensus or to
                                abstain. Our review of precedent and practice suggests that an
                                abstention does not necessarily mean acquiescence. Its significance
                                depends on the context of the tactical situation <pb facs="0876"
                                    n="830" xml:id="pg_830"/> and our explanatory statement. There
                                is no single strategy to protect <gloss target="#t_USG_1"
                                    >USG</gloss> interests. We must chart our course on a
                                case-by-case basis, taking care to balance our domestic and our
                                foreign policy concerns. That balance was, as you know, crucial to
                                the President’s decision to join consensus on the Final Declaration
                                of the World Population Conference, after we had explicitly and
                                repeatedly disavowed and voted against Paragraph 34.<note n="6"
                                    xml:id="d292fn6">The reference is in error; the presumably

                            <p>We continue to work hard at purging the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                    >UN</gloss> system of extraneous politicization. All of us in
                                the Department of State share your regret that so much time in
                                Mexico City was consumed by extraneous issues, but we are firmly
                                convinced that the final result was an advantage for the United
                                States. You have my appreciation for the patience and tact with
                                which you dealt with them.</p>

                                <salute>Dear <persName corresp="#p_GCE_1">George</persName> and
                                    Jeane:</salute>
                            </opener>
                            <p>I would like to record a few observations on the recent Population
                                Conference (and, by extension, the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                    >UN</gloss> conference phenomenon) while my impressions are
                                still fresh.</p>
                            <p rend="sectiontitleital"><hi rend="roman">1.</hi> Preparatory
                                Committee:</p>
                            <p>The preparatory work for the Conference was entrusted to a
                                Preparatory Committee. After several weeks’ work, the Committee
                                produced 85 specific recommendations for consideration by the
                                International Conference on Population in Mexico City. All but one
                                were adopted <pb facs="0877" n="831" xml:id="pg_831"/> by consensus.
                                The exception (which was bracketed in the Committee text) was an
                                irrelevant, politically loaded Soviet proposal concerning
                                disarmament.</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately, Western delegates to the preparatory conference
                                consisted largely of specialists on population and related subjects
                                to the apparent exclusion of any with a sensitivity to the
                                extraneous political issues endemic in the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                    >UN</gloss> system. As a result, the United States and others
                                failed to catch the political significance of a last-minute Arab
                                recommendation dealing with settlements in occupied territories.</p>
                            <p>This consensus Arab recommendation and the bracketed Soviet
                                recommendation were to plague the Mexico City Conference and consume
                                an inordinate amount of the time and effort of our delegation and
                                many others. We were ultimately able to neutralize the Soviet
                                thrust. We failed in our efforts to defang the Arab recommendation
                                in significant part because our less stalwart allies (that is to
                                say, everyone except Israel) were able to assert that the
                                Preparatory Committee had legitimized it.</p>
                            <p>While this was the most critical oversight of the U.S.
                                representatives to the Preparatory Committee, there were others
                                which we were able to defuse either through amendment or by taking
                                specific reservations to the final text—e.g. a recommendation urging
                                all nations to implement the International Code of Marketing of
                                BreastMilk Substitutes which the United States had so strongly
                                opposed two years earlier.</p>
                            <p>All this suggests the need to ensure that future U.S. teams preparing
                                agendas for conferences of specialized <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                    >UN</gloss> agencies contain at least one member with the
                                broader political knowledge required to prevent such oversights.</p>

                            <p>When I arrived in Washington the week before the Conference opened, I
                                found that precious little preparatory work had been done. The State
                                Department briefing book contained competent papers on a few key
                                    issues,<note n="9" xml:id="d292fn9">Briefing items for this

                                suggest a detailed examination of the entire agenda. No amendments
                                to the Preparatory Committee’s recommendations were prepared, and we
                                were provided with no analyses to back the U.S. policy. All of this
                                work was done by our delegation and support staff which had its
                                first full meeting in Mexico City the day before the Conference
                                opened.</p>
                            <pb facs="0878" n="832" xml:id="pg_832"/>
                            <p>I have a feeling that conferences of this type may fall within a very
                                large crack between the State Department and <gloss

                                that something be done to make sure that future delegations have the
                                benefit of the kind of thorough preparatory work I found so helpful
                                when I was an Under Secretary.</p>

                                dynamics. The first involved the substance of the
                                Conference—population, in the case of Mexico City, and the
                                environment in Nairobi. In each case, most of the delegates were
                                concerned with the substantive issues, and viewed their particular
                                conference as a distinct and isolated meeting having large symbolic
                                importance for the subject under review.</p>
                            <p>At the same time, and on the other plane, each conference was just
                                one in a continuing stream of <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                                meetings in which American political interests of a wholly different
                                order are very much engaged—usually in the form of extraneous,
                                politically-charged matters introduced by the Soviets and members of
                                the Third World.</p>
                            <p>Thus, at such conferences, the U.S. delegation is faced with twin
                                agendas; and how it handles its responsibilities will have an impact
                                not only on the substantive matters before the conference, but on
                                the ability of other U.S. delegations to deal with extraneous issues
                                at future conferences.</p>
                            <p>On the substantive plane, we accomplished far more at Mexico City
                                than we had reason to expect. Our amendments were carefully selected
                                and the majority found their way into the final text in one form or
                                another. As a result, the final report reaffirms the primacy of
                                parental rights, condemns coercion, and contains a far more balanced
                                presentation of progress to date and problems remaining to be
                                addressed than would otherwise have been the case. We even succeeded
                                in insinuating the phrase “entrepreneurial initiatives” into a
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> document! But on the other
                                plane, the one important to our ability to be effective at future
                                conferences, we lost ground and, I suspect, needlessly so.</p>
                            <p>In accordance with our instructions, we went all out in our efforts
                                to eliminate or neutralize the Soviet and Arab intrusions. We
                                hammered away at the theme that the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                    >UN</gloss> system was in danger of destroying itself if it
                                allowed such blatantly political side issues to disrupt fora
                                intended for the sober discussion of basic human problems in which
                                all nations had a common stake; and we could point to the enormous
                                diversion of attention from substantive issues at Mexico City to
                                prove our point.</p>
                            <pb facs="0879" n="833" xml:id="pg_833"/>
                            <p>But after we had expended considerable political capital, after we
                                had gone to the mat and suffered public bruises in the attempt, we
                                in the end voted against the Arab recommendation, recorded our stern
                                reservations . . . . and then joined the consensus. The first
                                question asked me by a reporter after it was all over was, “Why did
                                you cave?” His assessment was not unique.</p>
                            <p>This Administration may be the first in a couple of decades to truly
                                take the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> seriously. But to be
                                effective, we must also make sure that the <gloss target="#t_UN_1"
                                    >UN</gloss> takes us seriously. From everything I have been able
                                to read and hear, we have been making headway over the last couple
                                of years in this regard. After the Mexican experience, however, I
                                would anticipate that at future <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                                conferences we will find the Arab and Soviet blocs even less willing
                                to talk reason, our Western allies more reluctant to lean on Third
                                World delegations, and the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                                Secretariat itself more complacent. And here we must be willing to
                                face up to the tensions that will inevitably appear between the two
                                planes on which such conferences currently operate.</p>
                            <p>In Nairobi as well as Mexico, there was enormous pressure on the
                                United States not to cause the conference to end in a “failure” by
                                insisting on an important point of principle. This reflects the
                                assumption (which I gather has assumed the status of a <gloss
                                    target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> mystique) that the mere failure to
                                achieve consensus on a final conference document somehow negates the
                                agreement on all of the substantive matters that may have been
                                achieved in the prior days. Yet if I understand UNese correctly,
                                this is analytical nonsense. An abstention will deny consensus, but
                                at the same time it is taken as an act of acquiescence in everything
                                as to which a formal reservation has not been taken.</p>
                            <p>In the case of the Population Conference, and again as I understand
                                it, a U.S. abstention would in practical terms have had the effect
                                of a U.S. acceptance of every substantive recommendation that had
                                been adopted by the Conference. Abstention would not have reduced by
                                one hair America’s continued undertaking to support voluntary family
                                planning programs, nor would it have affected the obligation of
                                other nations to honor the results of the Conference.</p>
                            <p>But because consensus holds such symbolic importance within the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>, had we been able to
                                demonstrate that the United States will withhold consensus in
                                support of a strong point of principle, we would not have lost any
                                substantive ground, but we would have enhanced the ability of
                                American delegations to future conferences to excise the kind of
                                gratuitous mischief that increasingly plagues such meetings.</p>
                            <p>Given this experience, I would urge the two of you to hammer out some
                                sort of policy to govern the conduct of U.S. delegations at whatever
                                conference next comes over the horizon. It is my recommendation that
                                if we do not intend to back an important U.S. position with the <pb
                                    facs="0880" n="834" xml:id="pg_834"/> only kind of action which
                                will make an impression on the <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss>
                                fraternity, the U.S. delegation should be instructed to do no more
                                than make the necessary pro forma objections for the record, and to
                                concentrate its time and political capital on more fruitful matters.
                                On the other hand, if we are serious about being taken seriously,
                                the delegation must be armed with the only ammunition that
                                apparently counts.</p>

                        <p>Because of special public attention to the China program in the media, I
                            directed a careful review of the <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1"
                                >UNFPA</gloss>–China program. In reading the project paper I had
                            several questions about areas where more information was required:</p>
                        <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Training and improvement of administration of the
                                family planning councils at national and local levels.</hi> Since
                            the coercive aspects of the China program result from the way the family
                            planning workers go about their business, this inevitably raises issues
                            about indirect support of coercive activities. However, examination of
                            the program makes it clear that training is on overall systems problem
                            such as logistics and management information systems.</p>
                        <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Training</hi>. The medical training programs do not
                            include abortion.</p>
                        <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Public Education</hi>. The staff study has
                            concluded that <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss>’s funds are used
                            to promote the advantages of smaller families and the one child norm
                            through films, posters and other instruction materials. Since
                            “persuasion” is the essence of Chinese style coercion as demonstrated
                            last year by the NOVA program, even broad general educational campaigns
                            may serve to dignify and justify the message and thus to reinforce the
                            coercive actions. However, <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss> is
                            not directly <pb facs="0882" n="836" xml:id="pg_836"/> involved in the
                            coercion and therefore its funding is not part of specific program
                            activities which involve coercion.</p>
                        <p>Whether this complies with the Population Policy turns on the meaning of
                            the reference to “coercive family planning programs.” If China’s
                            activities are viewed as a single “program” any support could be a
                            disqualifying event. If each component is a separate “program” then most
                            of the <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss> funding for China raises
                            no issue. The education component may or may not be a difficulty based
                            on how the policy should be interpreted for “indirect” impact of
                            activities.</p>

                            of the Agency for International Development, today announced his
                            decision to withhold dollars 10 million in U.S. support of the United

                                target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss> has been disbursed today to that
                            organization.</p>
                        <p>In announcing the decision, <persName corresp="#p_MMP_1"
                                >McPherson</persName> emphasized that it indicated no retreat from
                            support of voluntary family planning. ‘The administration’s policy
                            remains to support broadened availability of family planning services so
                            that individuals can freely decide on the number of children they
                            desire’, <persName corresp="#p_MMP_1">McPherson</persName> stated.
                            ‘However, we will not associate U.S. funding, even indirectly, with
                            coercion which the U.S. views as a violation of human rights.’</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MMP_1">McPherson</persName> explained that the
                                <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> internal review of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss> program had been completed and
                            demonstrated satisfactorily that <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1"
                                >UNFPA</gloss> neither funds abortions nor supports coercive family
                            planning practices through its programs. However, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MMP_1">McPherson</persName> stated, the practices in the
                            family planning programs of one country is such that any support for
                            that country’s program is linked with and gives the appearance of
                            condoning its practices. The amount the U.S. is withholding from <gloss
                                target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss> represents approximately the
                            amount of <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss>’s budget scheduled to
                            go to that country.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> will ask <gloss target="#t_OMB_1"

                        <p>—Various <gloss target="#t_UN_1">UN</gloss> resolutions and the recent
                            recommendations adopted at the International Conference on Population
                            (Mexico City, 1984) recognize the right of all people to freely decide
                            the number and spacing of their children.</p>
                        <p>—Coercion is inconsistent with U.S. values and culture that even indirect

                        <p>3. Further Concerns.</p>
                        <p>—As the major donor to <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss>, we
                            expect that public opinion in the U.S. and abroad will hold U.S.

                        <p>—Policy is non-discriminatory. If we become aware of other programs
                            inconsistent with U.S. values, similar action will be taken.</p>
                        <p>—However, we expect press reports will connect the action with China.</p>
                        <p>Unquote.</p>
                        <p>4. Following presentation of the talking points, Wang Li commented
                            soberly that the decision apparently reflected some misunderstanding of
                            the Chinese Government’s position on coerced abortion and other abuses
                            in China’s family planning program which have got widespread press
                            attention. Wang stated that the Chinese Government position on these
                            matters was clear: While the government’s policy was to promote and
                            encourage the one-child-per family concept, it was adamantly opposed to
                            coercion, regularly made known this opposition at a high level, and took
                            measures to punish offenders. These principles had been spelled out in
                            detail in Ambassador Zhang’s letter to Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGP_1">Shultz</persName>,<note n="4" xml:id="d294fn4"
                                >Not found.</note> and had been made known in other correspondence
                            and discussions with <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss> and the
                                Congress.<note n="5" xml:id="d294fn5">Not further identified.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. But in a country as vast as China, Wang commented, it was inevitable,
                            undeniable, and unfortunate that abuses did occur from time to time. It
                            was therefore all the more unfortunate that foreign journalists, relying
                            principally upon material in the Chinese press intended precisely to
                            underscore the government’s strong opposition to family planning abuses
                            such as female infanticide and forced abor<pb facs="0885" n="839"
                                xml:id="pg_839"/>tion, had exaggerated the scale of the abuses and
                            left the mistaken impression that the government had tacitly supported
                            such abuses.</p>
                        <p>6. In further discussion, Wang expressed the hope that the Department’s
                            press guidance be constructed so as not to single out Chinese programs
                            for criticism. <persName corresp="#p_ALD_1">Anderson</persName>
                            reiterated that the press release did not mention China, that our side
                            would seek to make plain that our decision reflected a general policy

                        <p>Women in developing countries are at high risk of developing health
                            problems because of workload, exposure to communicable diseases, closely
                            spaced pregnancies, and lack of access to health care. Women are also
                            largely responsible for the health of their children (both preventive
                            measures and curative care). Efforts must be made to improve women’s
                            access to, utilization of, and benefits from health care, including
                            family planning.</p>

                        <p>If women are to achieve their potential as contributors to the economic
                            development of their communities, regions, and nations, they must be
                            freed from the burden of disease and disability that impinges on their
                            performance. This means women must have economic, geographic, and social
                            access to health care appropriate to their needs. Such care should
                            include appropriate technologies, the proper mix of health care
                            providers (including female medical personnel at all levels and
                            upgrading the training of traditional providers like midwives), free
                            informed choice of treatments, and availability of services for women
                            when and where they can be used without jeopardizing women’s economic or
                            family responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. delegation urges host countries and donors alike to improve
                            training programs for women in health and family planning and to
                            decrease barriers to their economic advancement in these areas. Because
                            income, health, and opportunities for advancement are directly related
                            to educational levels, the U.S. endorses education for girls and women
                            as an integral part of this strategy.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">BACKGROUND:</p>
                        <p>Women are particularly vulnerable to health problems because of
                            pregnancy, especially closely spaced pregnancies. When the physiological
                            load of pregnancy and lactation is superimposed upon heavy demands for
                            physical labor (including productive work as well as carrying firewood
                            and water), poor nutrition, and exposure to environmental contamination
                            and contagious diseases, the end result is often a progressive
                            deterioration of women’s health and nutrition status over their
                            reproductive years. This vicious circle can be broken in several
                            ways—improving women’s economic status, increasing the period between
                            pregnancies, and improving health care. All three problems need to be
                            addressed. One thread running through all three is the need for
                            education for girls and women so that they can earn more income, control
                            their own fertility, and demand and utilize better health care.</p>
                        <p>An analysis of the health constraints affecting women reveals that many
                            are related to their roles as women, not the least of which is the role
                            of water fetching and transporting. Many women spend from four to eight
                            hours a day drawing, carrying, managing, and using water. Improvements
                            in water supply and sanitation lighten the burden of women and children
                            freeing energy and time for other productive tasks that produce income.
                            Women should be involved in the planning and implementation of water and
                            sanitation projects.</p>
                        <p>The United States continues to support primary health care, education and
                            training for girls and women, economic opportunities for women, and
                            informed choice about health and family planning.</p>

                                The amendment provided the President the authority to determine

                            <hi rend="italic">expect</hi> the $10 million to be withheld. (Senator

                        <p>I believe a decision not to apply <persName corresp="#p_KJF_1"
                                >Kemp</persName>/Inouye and to make available the $10 million, even
                            if subject to the conditions proposed by State, would generate such an
                            adverse reaction that Congress would enact greater restrictions on our
                            contribution to <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss> in 1986,
                            probably in the FY 1986 appropriations bill. It would lead directly and
                            immediately to the result State hopes to avoid. Conversely, if <persName

                            does not enact a more restrictive provision, we may be able to provide
                            assistance to <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss> in FY 1986, if it
                            limits its program in China to providing contraceptives.</p>

                            that coercion is neither encouraged nor condoned, there is no doubt that
                            the China program includes coerced abortion and involuntary
                            sterilization. The one-child-family policy is implemented by setting
                            targets for authorized births at provincial and lower levels which are
                            interpreted as quotas by zealous officials whose performance in meeting
                            planned targets is reinforced, at all levels, by a system of incentives
                            to reward success and disincentives to punish failures. These abuses
                            have been extensively documented.</p>

                            Report “that the United Nations Fund for Population Activities would be
                            immediately affected by this amendment”.<note n="4" xml:id="d297fn4"

                                99–142.</note> He also explained that participation in the
                            management of a program of coercive abortion includes providing census
                            data, training and other assistance to China’s family planning agencies.
                                <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss> provides this general

                        <p>The decision you are asked to make involves sorting out the competing
                            pressures of (1) avoiding conflict in our relations with the Chinese,
                            (2) deciding the future of <gloss target="#t_USG_1">USG</gloss> support
                            to <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss>’s family planning programs,
                            and (3) managing the pressures from a vocal and powerful domestic
                            constituency. The two options have been distilled out of lengthy
                            discussions on the subject as we have sought to weigh <pb facs="0892"
                                n="846" xml:id="pg_846"/> the foreign policy interests involved
                            against the need to minimize the political dangers at home.</p>
                        <p>I am not in the best position to judge the domestic consequences, but on
                            foreign policy grounds I come out strongly in favor of Option 2 which
                            would obligate the $10 million for <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1"
                                >UNFPA</gloss>’s China program but withhold its disbursement until
                                <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss> restructured its program in
                            China to concentrate exclusively on provision of contraceptive devices,
                            or until there was significant Chinese action to limit any abuses in the
                            administration of their programs. I think this decision could be
                            defended with the Right-to-Life people by the logical argument that aid
                            to contraceptive programs diminishes incentives for abortions to which
                            the critics here object.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> has been pretty actively lobbying
                            around town on behalf of option 1. You may want to call a few of the key
                            players in to convey your decision and insist on some discipline in

                        <p>A second issue is who makes the call. If we decide that the $10 million
                            should be withheld, the amendment states that the formal determination
                            should be made by the President. L feels that this act can be in fact

                            activities in China. He stressed that only the Governing Council and the

                            administration, could address <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss>’s
                            conditions for FY 86. Several major donors voiced positive support for

                            reviews of the <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss> programs in

                            quotations from various congressional presentations, from Chinese

                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SRM_1">Salas</persName> traced the long history
                            of family planning and contraception beginning with ancient Egypt, and
                            noted that population programs <pb facs="0894" n="848" xml:id="pg_848"/>
                            would always be controversial in that they deal with sex as well as with
                            a range of religious and cultural views. Through the United Nations,
                            governments had come a long way in recent years in providing almost
                            universal endorsement to the world population plan of action and through
                            the growing and significant resource commitment by recipient governments
                            to population activities. <persName corresp="#p_SRM_1">Salas</persName>
                            observed that only seven years ago China declined to participate in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss> program, under the belief
                            that it was overly influenced by Western countries.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss> 1985 activities would not be
                            significantly affected by the withholding of $10 million, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SRM_1">Salas</persName> repeated several times that, in
                            anticipating the outcome, the money had not been programmed. The
                            implications of the loss of U.S. funding in 1986 was far more serious,
                            since <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> had been providing in recent
                            years up to a third of <gloss target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss>’s
                            support. The two conditions set by the U.S. for further funding, namely
                            the punishment of population program abuses by “the Chinese program,” or
                            a radical change in the program, “such as supplying only
                            contraceptives,” could not be feasibly met by the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss> administration. The central issue,
                            as <persName corresp="#p_SRM_1">Salas</persName> perceives it, is that a
                            major donor is attempting to negotiate program changes with
                            international civil servants rather than with the appropriate body,
                            e.g., the <gloss target="#t_UNDP_1">UNDP</gloss> Governing Council.</p>
                        <p>5. While channels to the U.S. Government remain very much open, <gloss
                                target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss> had been talking with other
                            donors, including the OPEC bloc, and private industry about filling the
                            gap left by a possible U.S. withdrawal in 1986. He announced that
                            commitments in principle had been made by the Netherlands, Japan,
                            Norway, Denmark and the <gloss target="#t_UK_1">UK</gloss> to increase
                            their funding, although the representatives of the latter two countries
                            quickly interjected that 1986 funding decisions had not yet been
                            resolved by their respective governments.</p>
                        <p>6. The U.S. representative offered some clarification on the removal of
                            the 16 earmarking of the <gloss target="#t_AID_1">AID</gloss> population
                            account, and on the end-of-fiscal year need to reprogram the $10
                            million. Japan voiced concern that the law suit taken on behalf of the
                            Population Institute and representatives <persName corresp="#p_GGS_1"
                                >Green</persName> and Kostmayer against <gloss target="#t_AID_1"
                                >AID</gloss> on the reprogramming might serve to escalate feelings
                            on both sides of the issue and result in further damage to <gloss
                                target="#t_UNFPA_1">UNFPA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>7. In a brief but pointed intervention, the Canadian Perm Rep stated that
                            Canada and the U.S. were the two most litigious nations on earth, but
                            nevertheless they differed on this issue for the following reasons:</p>
